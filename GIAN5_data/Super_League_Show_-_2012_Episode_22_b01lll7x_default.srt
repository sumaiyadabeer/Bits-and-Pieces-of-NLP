Good evening. Thanks for taking a break from the Olympics it enjoyed
the best action in Round 22 of the Super League. The play offs are
looming and all of the contenders are looking to go faster, Higher,
Millward and Jamie Peacock, MBE. Jamie was in action last night as
the Rhinos looked to extend their Andy Raleigh is going to search for
Double movement, that is the question. Is that all one movement?
The video referee has to decide. It's given. Wakefield have the
perfect start. Deservedly so, they has. Step back, on the inside. The
obstruction. Hall takes the Inside path. Ward is ahead of him. That
looks like the wrong defensive is ahead of Ryan Hall. The tackle
is made, it looks like the wrong decision. The ball continues, the
try was scored. No try, penalty his pace like? Four, five in
pursuit. He's not going to goal of the way, but there might be a man
who could. Kallum Watkins. Look at that full pace. Kallum Watkins,
youngster. He knew he was not going to go the distance, so he looked
for support. Kallum Watkins is flying. No chance that the

defenders around him. A terrific They still have a chance. They will
score. Danny Washbrook. What was he that way would surely have been a
score. He thought it was opportunity lost. But it was not.
Wakefield try! Surely, this is the one that wins it. A little surge
across the line. Andy Raleigh, sleeve, Leeds. You would still give
them a chance of getting back in to the game. Three tries, they need to
score. Here they come. Sinfield, with a kick to the corner. Hall has
done it again. A hat trick, this time along the ground. The same
method, Kevin Sinfield with the kick. Superbly weighted. He knows
that these are desperate moments clock down, at the least. There
will be looking for a repeat set up. It's been missed, and scored.

Peter Fox that will get the final word. Wakefield will celebrate a
Not many people predicted that. What went wrong for Leeds?
Wakefield played too well for us. We started poorly and gave us too
much to do in the second half. I don't want to take anything away
from Wakefield, they were the better side. Did you sense they
were really pumped for the game against the big city rivals? It's
always difficult. They are on a bit of a roll. They turned over
Huddersfield the week before. They have almost turned themselves into
like a top aide sighed. They thoroughly deserved it and we
didn't play well. How do you explain a result like that?
Wakefield had been playing well. They had a great win against
Huddersfield. They blew a couple of opportunities and dropped it over
the try line a couple of times. I liked the way that they had
composure to finish it off. They had a high completion rate and
their kicking game was a lot stronger. Sykes and Smith gave them
a clinical kicking game. They were the better team and they played
very well this year. I think Richard Agar deserves a lot of
credit. He had to put a team in late, but he put an experienced
team with some good players together. Another influential
player, Kyle Wood? It a great example of a player that had to go
back to the championship, learned some of his trade, come back up and
get some opportunities. There are a lot of good players in the
championship that could get opportunities. He's got speed, he
creates some doubt around the ruck area. He creates doubt amongst
Jamie's team mates. He brings a kicking game from dummy half. He
brings a long kicking game. He's a player that will grow in confidence
the more he gets to play. They had their best player out. He was out
with a broken jaw. But if that gives him confidence, he will
handle it well. For Leeds, it looks like a mirror image of last season.
You have to come from outside the top four to make a Grand Final?
disappointing thing is that if we had beat them, it was in our hands
to get into the top four, if we won every game we had left. Now we have
to look at what other teams do. We're going to have to do it from
outside that four. We have to get on with it, like last year. Richard
   Richard Descartes    Richard Agar? Sometimes you have to start
from scratch again. New owners, the people involved, fresher approach.
More of an outside looking in approach. Looking to see what we
need, organisation. They bought well, they played well, they had
confidence. It's a hard place to go to. It's one of the few grounds
where it is still the original dressing room. Jamie is laughing.
He is probably the only one that can fit into it. His mates have to
be outside! We play them on Sunday in a local derby. One game each. We
will have to play well to be in it. The ongoing crisis at Bradford
rumbles on. There are potential saviours in the wings. As if they
didn't have enough trouble, they went to high flying Warrington.
They were on the end of a real hiding. 50 points? Warrington is a
tough place to got the best of times, never mind the Troubles they
have of the pitch. I think the players and coaches deserve credit
for the way they had been playing. We went the week before and they
came back in the second half. They held back and got 20 points in the
second half. They showed some spirit. They have shown spirit of
occasion. Can you sense in their body language that they have
player, not sure where the club will be at or who you will be
playing for next year. Give them the best job they could do. They
have had positive results. They have beaten Wigan. To go to
Warrington, it was a bit too much for them. Mick Potter is working
for free. It's a bit of a brotherhood, coaching. You must
have sympathy? You do have an alliance to your players. He's done
a fantastic job. I don't think anybody could understand what he is
experiencing. All of the turmoil, the blokes not knowing if they are
going to get paid, have they got a team next year? I think they have
handled it well, the players, touching staff. He has led that by
being the leader of the pack. But understand that his coaching at the
moment for nothing. The reason he does that is probably because he
loved coaching and rugby league. There comes a time when he needs to
move on and the club need to move on with some decisions. The six
points deduction takes them out of the play offs. That is probably the
only hope that the players have of a focus. If we can win games, we
can make the play offs. They have gone quite a few years without
making the play offs. It would be very hard in coming weeks, for the
players. Warrington look pretty challenging ahead of the Cup final?
There are good side. They got a great coach and a lot of superstar
players. We've got a challenge to beat them. Four tries for Stefan
Ratchford. Looking terrific? Looking at that ability, with no
injuries, they can rotate the squat with the Challenge Cup in mind, the
Super League, hopefully a Grand Final at Old Trafford. In key areas,
they are very strong. They have Michael Weiner and, Richard Myler.
You've got O'Brien, a lot of players. A lot of players that we
call the backbone of the team. They are very good in that area. They
play in an enterprising way. The great thing for Jamie's team, Leeds
are playing well. They are playing at this stage better than they were
last year. Warrington were playing just as good when they were winning
Warrington's win with them within three points of Wigan. They got off
to a flying start? Three tries in We made a couple of poor defensive
decisions. The players showed their commitment. We went into the game
with one half, I thought, what night will we have here when he got
hurt. There was a lot of will to work with each other. They created
a few opportunities the Cas players. We didn't have the cutting edge to
We didn't have the cutting edge to finish off with. It On half time
there was a controversial penalty. Second half there was nip and tuck
with both teams. Their quality and more cutting edge and execution got
them some late tries. I was please pleased with the attitude of our
players. Sean was disappointed that they sort of went into like a phase
there in the second half, they weren't up tempo. I noticed things
about their game, they could have played quicker. Maybe they were
looking at the score board and not respecting playing for 80 minutes.
Almost basketball moves there. Is he contender for Man of Steel?
Definitely. A standout player. He does things that no other players
can do. He is a tough little player. A word about Danny. He announced
his retirement at the end of the season. How big a miss and what has
his contribution been? He started in 1996. He was a Cas guy. It a
great breeding area. Went to lon doe don Broncos. He is a good role
model. He want to get him to spend more time with our juniors. He has
more time with our juniors. He has a couple more games left to go.
This time last year, Sean Long was facing up to retirement after a
series of injuries took their toll. But following the sale of Matty
Smith to Wigan, the colourful and charismatic Salford assistant coach
is to make a comeback for the City Reds and he can't wait to get back
in action again. Now, I'm back to let you know, I
can really shake them down can really shake them down
Do you love me I can really move
Do you love me I'm in the groove...
Sean Long won every honour in the game in a glittering playing career.
Last he he hung up his boots to become Salford's assistant coach.
The City Reds are short of cover, she on stand by. I miss Super
League. It's fast and quick. I played it since it started, I
wouldn't mind playing again. I'll put my hand up and if need be and
put my hand up and if need be and called upon I will play. He has
achieved everything there is in the game. He has the experience. In
training he is fantastic. To have him on the field will be great.
It's a good thing he decided to put his boots on. He has not lost. It
he can still do. It He talks the game and wants to play. He has his
fitness about him. You don't lose your rugby mind. It's other parts
of your body that goes. He may be keen to play again, but he has made
a big impression as a coach with the Reds winning praise for their
attacking play. We are playing to our strengths. We have lads who are
skilful players. We are trying to force them to use the ball. When
they get tired they stick it under their jumper and taking the ball in.
I'm trying to get them to do player, player and see what happens. They
have been great. He has done a great job. That is obvious in our
attack this year. He has handled that. We are scoring points.
Everyone feels comfortable. He has been great for the team.
telling the boys to do a bit off the cuff and call it ad lib footie.
Sometimes it doesn't come off. If they practice it in training it
will come off in the game. I let them do what they want. That is why
they like me, I think. Basically everything about our attack came
from Sean Long. It's really good. We roll with the punches together.
He comes up with ideas, I come up with ideas, whether that is attack
or defence. That is the role of assistant coach. He is doing a good
job at it. I will have the crack all the time. He is not as bad at
what people see on the camera. He is a bit grumpy at times. Good
bloke. He knows his stuff. I learnt a lot with him. Phil did ten years
as an assistant. Maybe I have to do towards. That I am willing to do.
That I'm still learning. The man management and controlling the team.
I'm just coaching at the moment. That will come in time. I want to
improve as a coach and do my best for Salford. Since we filmed that,
Mark Sneed has broken his leg. He may see some action. Do you fear
for him? Is it the right thing? will be able to do. It he is tough
mentally, they will be able to do. It he will have the skills. Whether
he can do it week to week with his body, that will be the question.
Only he can answer. That he will lift the team when he does play.
You coached him for many years. You knew he would take that move into
coaching? He is very smart. A good operator in regard to his
perception on the game. A great game sense. He wanted to dissect
the game. Great to coach. He could carry out instructions and take it
to the next dimension by looking at the opposition and seeing what
needed to be adjusted. They don't see the person who has a great
thought for the game and great ideas and a great way I think he
could coach. He will end up a very, very good coach. I think he should
keep coaching. I'm not sure he needs to come back and play. I
think he is doing a good job. I hope he doesn't play. He has been
one of the great players of Super League era. I think he could turn
into a very good coach. You have been warned. Salford were one of
Sean's former clubs Hull FC on Sunday. The black and whites were
buoyed by last week's victory in Hull Derby and picked up another
two points. They are coming into two points. They are coming into
form again? They are. They had the Derby win the previous week. They
had disruptions with injuries also. When they look Matty Smith it took
away a lot of their fluency. They have a good tile style. They play
similar to the West Tigers. They use ball movement. Both teams were
good with the ball. They showed greenness in their defence and
attitude at the moment. Have Salford threft too late? A little
bit late now. They played well this year. They have improved their
attack a lot. We found them a very difficult side it play against, as
have a lot of other teams as well. Salford struggle to keep hold of
their players? It is. There is conjector about Daniel Holdsworth.
That is the issue. They have gone to a new stadium. It hasn't
fulfilled the finances they wanted to bring in with regard to the
crowds. They have to cut their cloth to what they can afford. Luke
Patton is retiring. A couple of other players haven't been offered
contract. They will have to look for recruits. There is some
interesting times at Salford. Difficult players to place there,
isn't there? Spot on. Hull level with you on points? We slipped 7
last night.we could have done with being two in front of them. Hull
have been good this year. When you get to the squad numbers 38 and 39
you show the injuries we have had throughout the year. Four points
clear in eighth, Widnes gave them a fright? Widnes have been tremendous.
They won me over and deserve their place in Super League. They have a
great owner, great coach. The players play with great spirit.
They have come together late and play with spirit. They deserve
their place in Super League. threw some youngsters in there?
made changes because he had to make them. They looked flat in that
Derby game. Widnes are at the stage where Hull were since they came
back in the Super League. They are good at home Widnes. They are hard
to beat their. The surface is not a normal surface, it's artificial. I
think the young fresh guys are good for Hull KR. Widnes continued how
they were playing at home over the last month. Do Widnes have to find
their fleet? They will. You have to get the players used to week in
week training. Players getting used to new team mates and new surface.
It takes transition period. Is it fancyful to suggest they might make
the top eight the next season? is what Super League should be
about. We start the season hoping your team can make the eight. They
bought Kevin Brown. Danny Tickle may go there. They are getting a
lot of confidence at the back end of the season. They keep on picking
up points? They have been unlucky with injuries. If they kept their
full squad out they would have been higher up the table. They are doing
as well so far. Victories for both Hull sides piled the pressure on
Huddersfield whose play off hopes seem to be rapidly disappearing.
The Giants travelled to St Helens on Sunday evening where they have
never won in the Super Leagueer ya. At the end of round one Hull looked
to be real contenders there was talk of a grand final place. Then
head coach announced he would move move to St Helens. Things began to
move to St Helens. Things began to After a run of seven defeats in
eight games, Brown departed ahead of schedule. His former right hand
man has the test of rediscovering man has the test of rediscovering
Huddersfield defence was cut to ribbons. They have the numbers here.
Tommy make inson, what a finish that might    Tommy Makinson, what
a finish that might be. They need a replay. What a try! Confirmation,
five minutes played, Saints have one two. Jonny Lomax on the end of
it. Another score for St Helens and well executed here between Lomax
and Flannery. Here's Roby. He seems to be at the start of everything
for St Helens, doesn't he? Roby is back again. His motor is running
well. The kick is not the best, sliced high. There are still
opportunities here. It is taken well by Wellens. Foot down by
Francis Meli. It's another for St Helens. It's looking a little easy.
I'm not sure the kick was intended to drop where it did. Wellens made
the most of. It once they had it, St Helens quick to promote it wide
and Meli quick to score. Roby. It has been dropped here. It has,
knocked on. A mistake has given Huddersfield the possession. A poor
catch, wasn't, it by Frankie. What about this for a first play. Brough
with a kick behind the line. Taken by George. Huddersfield closing in
and crashing over. Keith Mason, the former Saint, is the man who scores
the try. This is brave stuff for a team supposedly lacking in
confidence. First play kick by Brough. Having got as close as that,
they were not going to waste the We got to the half hour mark and St
Helens are looking for another. Lance Hohaia is enjoying himself at
the moment. That is one of the reasons why. The referee is having

on my crush's face. By another St puts the foot down and he goes to
score himself. Very often, the creator and the architect. This
time, the finisher. They have a look at this again. Was there an
obstruction? That is the question. There is no doubting the sublime
skills of James Roby. Having got through, his pace was electric. The
side. Too easy for Paul Wellens. Huddersfield, losing heart. A very
simple try, despite the slip. Another win for St Helens, another
disheartening defeat for Another rough night for
Huddersfield. Nathan Brown has gone, their coaching staff are leaving,
something's wrong? Sport is about habits. They have got into some
habits now that are spiralling. The amount of points they are conceding,
you wouldn't imagine that in the first half of the season. It's a
chain of events. The coach going, the skipper going to Widnes, next
year. The way that they want to play, they probably have become a
bit Lateral. They lost their toughness. Jimmy Kebe probably talk
about that, without being critical of opposing players. They haven't
had that cutting edge and that tough mentality for a long time.
They are probably in a situation where they get behind, you start to
think, here we go again. Nathan had a great time. That is the right
time for Paul to come in and stamp his authority. Probably to play a
bit like how he used to play, tough, charge the ball into them, be
uncompromising. Do you point the finger at the players? Could they
have done more to stop the rot? There is some blame in their four
players. It's a big game. It's a snowball, rolling, when you get the
lack of confidence. They are only one game away from getting that
back. I think Paul is the man to do that for them. He's gone about it
the right way. Hopefully a win will come for them. Some of their
players are trying really hard but things aren't happening. I feel
sorry for some of them because they are trying hard. And yet, on the
night, Saints were running red hot. Lance Hohaia, fantastic? There will
always get you around the ruck area. He's been in great form. He's
played in numerous positions, fullback, stand off, hook area.
With imports as well, not all of them shine straight away. It takes
your while to bed into the culture, new team mates, new competition.
It's usually at the beck end    back end when you find that. The
style of play, the way they can score points, that makes it harder
for Huddersfield. Also, when you are on the back foot, you concede
some points. You are still trying but things are not happening. I
like the way the Saints are playing at the moment. They are playing
with a smile on their face. The style of play is really good. They
are a real contender for Super League. It's always competitive,
always dramatic and demands high levels of skill and concentration.
Yes, egg chasing is heading for a thrilling climax. London Broncos
are taking up the challenge. This week, the London Broncos take
the a Tasered challenge. They have to jump, duck and weave around this
course in the quickest time possible whilst holding a giant egg

utility. Oskar Thomas, half bank. Jamaica for the Olympics, let's go!
Well, you are not going to get a gold medal for disco dancing. Prawn
sandwiches at the ready. Usain Bolt in the background. Remember, they
are trying to get as low a time as possible. The idea is to keep the
egg honour the spoon. Here comes Oskar Thomas. Carefully does it.
Over the bar. Not the quickest lad. He is at least keeping his eye on
the egg. Slowly around the obstacles. He has let it spill.
Comeback, Sam. You can't do that. I'm not sure that it in the rules

action. Around the sticks as well. London is not going to win it, just
in case you were worried. He's not going Teevan finished the course.
He doesn't make it to the end. A cake in frustration. 48.7 p to is
the time. I don't think that Usain Bolt has any thing to worry about.
They find themselves in 9th position. They are not dribbling
Well, it looks like Leeds Rhinos can end up with a wooden spoon. We
caught up with their coach before the trip to Catalan Dragons.
The future of the club is clear. The owner is investing up the
levels competitive with everybody else. That intent is clear. The
reason I am here is that the intent has not been delivered. The first
day we need to work on is that everybody has good habits. There
doesn't seem to be a real problem with liking it Shadow Hand Mara,
teamwork. There is good agility and energy. We have got some good
playmakers that can make some good decisions. We have never walk into
something that is not saveable. It is saveable it just needs pointing
the right direction. London looks to be going the right direction
with a much improved performance in pegging on. Toby Club opened up the
scoring. The scores were level as the inside man was found. For the
Broncos, with a renewed sense of confidence, they exposed the team
once more. Weeldon was allowed to drive at the back line. Controversy
followed when a try was ruled out for obstruction on the London
defence. That was much to the defence and of    annoyance of the
home fans. Glenn Fisher went over the post to level the scores at 12 
12. In a closely contested second half, it was a piece of individual
brilliance that proved the difference between the sides. The
