Here are the nine contestants preparing for today's show.
Only one of them will win up to £10,000.
The others will leave with nothing when voted off as the weakest link.
Welcome to the Weakest Link.
Any of the nine people in the studio here today
could win up to £10,000.
They've only just met, but to get the prize money,
they'll have to work together.
However, eight will leave with nothing
Let's meet the team.
My name's Simon. I'm 52, from Lancaster,
and I'm a booking office clerk.
I'm Fiona. I'm 34. I live in Wakefield,

To remind you, in each round there's £1,000 to be won.
The fastest way is to create a chain of nine correct answers.
Break the chain, and you lose all the money in that chain.

Who's on the right track, and who might be on the train track?
Time to vote off the weakest link.
In an impressive first round, Chris is the strongest link.
The statistics reveal that Sue is the weakest link,
but who will be the first to take the walk of shame?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
John.
Mark.

John.
Karen.
Mark.

  What do you do, Chris?

  Are you?
  Yes.
  Which theatre?
  The Ambassadors Theatre.
  So, you're a back room boy, are you?
Front of house. I'm the front of house manager,
box office manager. I encompass everything.

  Not out of choice, but yeah.
  Put your board down.
Is there just something you can sing for us?
  Do you have any favourite songs?
  No.
  Not unless you know any country.
  I know a bit of Dolly Parton,
  but I'm not very good at it.
  OK. Off you go, then.
This is going to be dreadful.
Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
  How's that? A bit more?
  No.
  No, I didn't think so.
  Put your board up.
  Why Mark?
  Because I can see him quite clearly from here.
  What do you do, Jen?
  I'm a PA, Anne.
  Are you?
  Yes.

I sing in a blues covers band, and I like to write, as well.
  Oh, a sort of Lady Gaga Cartland.
  Something like that, yes.
Can you sing any better than baby Chris?
  I could give it a go.
  Go on, then.
Born under a bad sign
Been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
  Oh, you are better than him.
  Thank you.
  Why Mark?
Um, well, nobody got their question wrong,
so it was picking a name out of a hat, really.
  Where are you from, Karen?
  From Wells in Somerset.
  Yes. And what do you do there?
  I'm a music teacher.
So, did you like those performances you just heard?
Um...they were very good.
  And are you a frustrated performer?
  Terribly.
  Have you got an ear for music?
  Um, I think so, yeah.
And how does your nose come in handy?
  I can sniff out talent really well.
  Yes.
  So, are you going to sing for us?
  Whatever you like.
  OK. Well, you sing, because the other two have.
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
So who do you think was best now   Jen, Karen or Chris?
Well, I'm not allowed to vote for myself, so probably Jen.
  And why are you getting rid of Mark?
  It was a real hard choice,
because everybody got their questions right,
but Mark was the quietest answer. I couldn't quite hear him.
Mark, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
When I get home, I suspect people may have hoped
I'd have gone further than the first round,
but when they know that I did answer my question correctly,
then, it's no bad thing.
Round two, and you have £1,000.
We're now taking ten seconds off your time.
We'll start with the strongest link from the last round.
That's the baby theatre manager, Chris.

  Yes.
It's more sort of heavy metal mutton, that.
I knew you were going to say that. You're never too old for leather.
Yes. Hop up again. Put your board up.
  Why John?
  Because he got the question wrong,
and I actually remembered, so...
When the vote's tied, the strongest link has to cast the deciding vote,
and the strongest link was Jen. Why have you voted for Fiona?
I thought that she took a little bit of time to answer the maths question
  and then in the end got it wrong.
  You have a choice now.
You can stick with Fiona or move to John.
I think it's only fair I stick with my first choice, Fiona.
Fiona, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
The maths question, I had to subtract 47 from 69,
which was really hard to do.
It was the type of question I knew I'd get wrong
as soon as Anne started to ask it,
and I was pleased that I at least had an attempt,
but obviously it wasn't good enough.
Round four. In the bank, £2,340. Another ten seconds off the time.

  You're still... Is something tight?
  It's the stripes. I can't help it.
  Yeah.
  He answered two questions wrong. That was the only reason.
  So, John, why Jim?
  He got questions wrong
but also lost quite a lot of money on one of those questions.
He was the worst player. Jim, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I think Karen might be voted off next
because she doesn't appear that confident in her answers,

  Actually, some were OK.
  Was it a good round for you?
  It was all right for me.
  I was quite happy.
  Really? Getting one question right?
I only got one wrong, though.
Karen didn't answer any questions correctly.
Karen, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.

and to be honest, his wriggling's putting me off a bit, so...
  Did you think he was the worst player?
  No. I think I was,
but he was next to me, I think.
The vote's tied. The strongest link has to cast the deciding vote,
and the strongest link is John. Why have you voted for Jen?

  She answered a few questions wrong.

I think I could've got.
