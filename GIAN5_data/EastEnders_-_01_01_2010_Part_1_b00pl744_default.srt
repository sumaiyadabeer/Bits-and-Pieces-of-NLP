Horse is here already, can you believe it?
Not before 12, I said. This is Walford, not Wyoming.
What's it going to eat? Concrete?
Oh, Pappoo.
What?
You look so...
So what, Mum?
So very...
very...
handsome.
I thought you'd done nails.
  That's toenails.
  Toes?
What you wearing to this wedding, darling, flip flops?
so that John Wayne out there can start his trek.
I wish I could watch him. I bet he'll look great, riding that horse.
Yeah. There's sandwiches here. You want one?
  Wheat makes me bloat.
  Well, I'll have hers.
  Tuna or cheese?
  Not hungry. All done.
  Thank you.
  Go on, have a sandwich.
I said I'm not hungry!
Been a naughty boy?
You better go and sort it out with her, Darren.
Cos you know exactly how to keep a relationship going(!)
Where are you going? Have I done something wrong?
  I don't know, have you?
  No, but did I do something bad last night?
I know I got quite drunk and I probably made a...
Heather!
I opened the card from Heather.
What was the misunderstanding and why did she give you 80 quid?
I weren't gonna mention it, but I bumped into Heather before Christmas,
crying so much that she could barely speak.
Shirley said Heather didn't have cash to buy George a Christmas present.
So, you gave her the money?
Well, I felt bad for her. But it turns out she did get him a present
and Shirley's got the wrong end of the stick.
You are just a big softie, really, aren't you?
  Oh!
  Now, it's not a real ruby, I'm afraid.
But it is real gold.
Nine carat.
Nine, you say?
I don't think you can tell the difference, do you?
It's very, er...pretty.
Oh, you cheeky...! How many carats?
18. And the ruby's from Gilgit.
  I got Shabs to buy it.
  Shabnam!
  We'll see her soon, I'm sure.
  Soon.
Anyway, who needs a daughter when you've got a Hunza Valley ruby, huh?
Bushra will turn green!
And to think that you were once that tiny baby in my arms, all pale and fragile.
Sickly baby, yes, I know.
What? I can't be over sentimental on this day of all days? Coat.
You're not losing me.
This marriage will bring great joy to you.
To all of us.
There are four dhol drummers standing outside, should I get them a cup of tea?
Whatever you think.
Fine!
Masood?
  Tea?
  Are you going to tell me why you're in such a foul mood?
  Tea?
  Is it still about the money?
  Not any more, no.
  Well, what then?
Why didn't you invite Inzamam?
I did. They couldn't make it.
Right. That's not what he said.
You've spoken to him?
Yes. We met up. I needed a loan.
You asked HIM for money?
How else can we pay Qadim back? Why didn't you invite him?
Yoo hoo!
Look, maybe I was mistaken, all right. Maybe I forgot.
You forgot?
You forgot to invite my brother?
Look, please can we discuss this later? I have to get to the venue.
You got any theories?
Yeah, I do as it happens. Janine Butcher.
Oh, so you don't think it was me this time? I'm honoured.
I'm so excited. The last wedding I went to was at The Dorchester.
It'll be refreshing to see something simpler, more provincial.
Zainab, you don't have to do this. I mean, I have got everything in hand.
I want every aspect of this wedding checked and checked again.
Nothing is going to ruin my... their special day.
I phoned Mum.
There's a flight leaving Heathrow for Miami tonight at 9.30.
  You should be on it.
  And miss the wedding of the year?
  Oh, please, Christian, you'll only embarrass yourself!
  And you.
All right, show up at the wedding, kick up a fuss, what good is it gonna do? He's never gonna choose you.
He can't.
Zainab will be devastated.
And Masood. Probably never speak to us again, think of the effect on the business!
The business?
It isn't nothing, Christian!
And if you want to think about people and feelings   what about Amira?
You know what, Jane? You're right.
It's far better that she marries a gay man.
She'll be totally humiliated!
Not if I do it right.
There is no way of doing this right!
And you'll hurt him.
You'll hurt Syed. And I know you don't want to do that.
Yes, I do.
Because he's a coward.
He knows what he is and what he wants.
And he's turning his back on me because he's scared.
  Can you blame him?
  And you know what else? You're a coward, too.
Because you know the truth,
yet you are quite happy with this farce of a wedding to go on because you don't want the business damaged,
  or your family embarrassed.
  It isn't like that!
  I'm your family too!
Jane!
I am your brother.
And even if you don't give a damn about me, what about them, eh?
Eh? Happy couple?
You think they're gonna be so happy five years down the line when she finds out what he really is?
Gah!
Ruin those shoes!
You look so smart!
  I thought you'd be getting ready.
  Denise popped out, so I thought I'd get some fresh air.
I'm so glad you're back.
  Syed hasn't been the same without you.
  I'm sure he's been just fine.
Your friendship means more to him than you think.
And I'm glad you're going to be there today.
I'll see you later.
At my wedding!
  Chelsea should travel with Amira. ETA?
OK. Syed will arrive at 13.45. Bushra?
  Myself and the girls will meet you at the door and distribute garlands.
  And?
  And?
Confetti, Bushra, confetti.
You are Amira's stand in family for today, please do not let her down.
Right. 13.45.
  Your movements?
  Shirley's doing drinks, Heather's doing nibbles.
  That's the best you could do?
  It's New Year's Day, the agency could only send four people!
  Fine, fine!
Just switch roles. Skinny one does food.
The Imran Khan Suite.
Oh! The temple of dreams.
Beyond these doors lies a vision of spellbinding majesty.
Hey hey, look at little Tambo!
Some lucky lady's gonna want a piece of that.
Don't. I'm paranoid enough as it is. Anyway, message from Afia.
"Hey, weirdo.
"What's your eye prescription?
"Afia. Kiss, kiss."
What does she mean? Is "eye prescription" some sort of youth slang that passed me by?
  Let me have a look.
  Come through, come through.
Oi, get up!
Ah!
Here he is, the golden boy on his wedding day. Assalamu alaikum!
Walaikum assalam, Uncle Inzamam.
Aunt Fatima.
We're so pleased you could make it.
So are we.
Now that somebody actually saw fit to let us know.
  I can't believe you gave him that money back.
  Quiet, Shirl!
If Libby asks, can you say I gave you some money but you didn't need it?
If she didn't need it, she wouldn't be working for Ian Beale today, would she?
Will you do it, Hev?
Thanks.
Can I see him?
No, you can't.
He's at Mrs Branning's.
All right. Thanks, anyway.
No, we're not doing this for you, you little scrote.
Do you think it's in her best interests if people find out that YOU are George's dad?
They'd have her committed.
Your shirt's ironed.
Do I have to go?
I think you're the main reason we were invited.
You can do a bit of Oxbridge PR for Tamwar.
There'll be other girls, my lovely.
Maybe she can't see past the chair.
No, I don't think Libby's like that.
What else could it be? We've got all this stuff in common.
A real connection. And she chooses him?
Well, there's wholesome vegetable soup and there's burgers
and sometimes people just can't resist a burger.
So, I'm soup?
No, no. You're, er...
You're caviar.
Come here. Mwah!
It won't last.
She's too good for him.
Time she realises it, it'll be too late.
I don't want to see them.
I haven't even finished getting ready.
Just pop your head round the door and say sorry about the mix up.
  They just need a bit of Zainab pixie dust.
  No.
Zee, hang on. Zee, wait!
He's brought the money to pay Qadim back. The least you could do is extend him a bit of courtesy.
I will NOT apologise to that smug, overbearing oaf of a man.
Masood's got your money.
You'll have to go.
I can't.
What is it?
What's wrong?
You look...
..exquisite.
You look...
..just like your mother.
We were thinking of entering Ali for the Junior Chess Champs.
But we decided against.
Children no longer provide a stiff enough challenge.
Adult chess, it is.
Adult chess?
Is that when you get to see a bit of the Queen's cleavage?
I'm sorry, I just remembered there's something I need to do.
Pity Shabnam couldn't make it.
Ah well, you know, she had work commitments.
She's a modern girl.
  We were disappointed, of course, but we understood.
  Really?
I like to think that Jamila here would drop everything if Ali were to be married.
Terrible nerves.
It's a big day for her.
When you've...
loved someone deeply and...
..you lose them, you...
adopt strategies.
Some people talk to the dead,
leave rooms untouched...
..sleep on the same side of the bed.
Others...
..push everything away.
I pushed you away.
Dad, it's OK.
No, no, no, it's not.
Your mother would be so...
..disappointed.
I haven't been a father to you.
It doesn't matter.
Who's walking you into the nikah?
Bushra.
Zainab's friend.
I wanted it to be Masood.
He's done so much for me over the past year,
but it's right that he should be with Syed.
Could you make it a bit more obvious that you don't like my brother and his family?
  I don't think they're quite getting it.
  Please, Mas.
  You don't look at them, talk to them.
  Has Fatima?
  You're not Fatima.
Maybe if you stood up for me, for your family,
instead of letting him bulldoze us with his loathsome opinions?
He's our guest and he's just lent us all this money.
  How many hours of condescension does that buy him?
  Come on, that's his manner!
And you let him get away with it.
He's sitting there sneering at us, insulting our children,
our home, our lack of religious devotion. And you just take it!
Yes, I do!
D'you know why I take it?
If I stand up to him, we argue. If we argue, he could withdraw that money.
If he does that, I can't pay for your perfect wedding! What d'you want me to do?
  I want you to defend me!
  But no one's attacking you!
Inzy's pompous, I know, and he likes to be on top, but he's harmless!
No, he's not!
What do you mean by that?
Just forget it, all right, Mas? Please, just go in there and I will join you...
WHAT did you mean by that?
Not today, please.
Not now.
Will you tell me?
  Zee!
  No, Mas!
  Zee!
You didn't forget to invite him, did you?
Look at me!
Everything, now.
I was married when we fell in love.
I'm tainted.
A fallen woman.
And in Inzamam's eyes, a fallen woman is fair game,
whether she be married to his brother or not.
You mean he made advances?
Many.
You look good.
What do you want, Christian?
I don't know.
It's my wedding day.
Wish me well.
That's just it.
I can't.
Stand up.
What's this? You want to check I'm still taller than you?
Are we going to wrestle?
I don't think you've beaten me yet.
I know.
Know what?
All your money
and 20 quid for the petrol.
You are not invited to the wedding and you're no longer welcome in this house. You got that?
I see your wife's unpredictable nature has rubbed off on you.
You know what? My wife has a name.
And for the record, she is the most remarkable person I've ever met.
She's your superior in so many ways, I couldn't even begin to list them!
Now get out of my house!
Thank you.
And how are you going to pay for all this now?
How much did that horse cost, Masood, these drummers?
Dhol drummers are ten a penny!
DRUMMING CEASES No offence.
Venue costs, food, entertainment.
  Will your righteous anger pay for all that?
  No.
But I will.
All of it.
Amira's told me everything you've done for her whilst I've been away.
You've been a father to her when I wasn't.
The money you owe me...
Keep it, eh?
I want to pay for my daughter's wedding.
Assalamu alaik...
  Thank you.
  Thank you.
Assalamu alaikum.
Walaikum assalam. Are we ready to go?
Absolutely.
So, where's Syed?
Didn't sleep a wink last night.
Turning everything over in my mind.
Should I tell Amira?
Your family?
  Here on the Square, before the ceremony?
  Tell them what, exactly?
  That you're gay!
  Isn't that for me to decide?
I think the evidence is pretty compelling.
  Are you trying to blackmail me into telling them myself?
  No!
No, of course not.
What exactly d'you want me to do?
I want you to be true to yourself.
True to myself?
You make it sound as if being attracted to men is the only part of me that matters.
Yes, I'm gay. There, I've said it.
But I'm also a son,
a brother,
a friend,
a Muslim.
Am I just supposed to just throw away all those other aspects of me?
Of course you don't throw them away, Sy!
But people would adjust.
You'll never understand, will you? This isn't about people adjusting!
This is about ME, Christian.
My family.
My faith.
It's my choice.
I'm gay...
..and I love you.
I wish I didn't but there you go.
So be with me, please.
I mean, what did you even come here for anyway?
Because I miss you.
Because I wanted to see you.
Because I hoped you might say it's all OK.
Well, I can't pretend that it is.
I'm going to marry Amira.
If you can make it, we'd both be pleased to see you.
That's how it has to be from now on.
What was wrong with him?
Who?
Christian. Looked like he was crying. Was he crying?
I don't know.
Well, who else is in there?
No one, Mum!
It was just me and him.
  Was he... was he trying to proposition you?
  No.
The man is infatuated.
An hour before your wedding? I'm going to go see him.
No, Mum, look!
It's not important.
We need to get going, yeah?
You're right. He is not going to ruin my Pappoo's big day.
Did I tell you how foxy you were looking today?
Full of Eastern promise.
Thought I'd better make an effort.
Because the person who's texting you day and night certainly is.
Oh, and Syed, make sure you take the baraat round the Square.
  Why?
  Because this horse is on A lister wages.
And I want to make sure that everyone sees you riding him.
Ah, yes. I'm sorry.
This is really incredible.
On behalf of my family, I just want to say thank you
for giving my eldest son such a wonderful send off.
Syed?
Syed?
Suppose I'd better go get married!
Drums!
You ready?
I'll meet you back at the house. I've just got one more thing to do.
Move.
Ooh! No booze?
  Of course, no booze.
  Obvious.
Can't believe you want more after last night, anyway.
I just wanted to say that Darren wasn't lying.
He gave me some money. and I didn't need it,
so that's why I sent that card,
the one that you opened?
Thanks, Heather. I appreciate it.
Only if she asked, he said.
Only if she asked!
  Oh...
  It's gonna be fine. What you getting yourself so worked up about?
I always was useless at lying.
And now I'm lying for Phil and I'm lying for Darren and I hate it.
  Yeah.
  I know it's for the best,
but it ain't about the lies I'm telling now.
One day, George is gonna ask who his daddy is and I won't be able to tell him
and all the time Darren's living across the Square.
Yeah, well, you've gotta get used to that.
You'll be watching his back as long as both of you are living on the Square.
Unless you don't mind people finding out.
You don't even try and hide it, do you?
Mooning over him like a lovesick teenager.
And as for luring him into the cafe on his wedding day, I ask you?
On his wedding day!
  Have you finished?
  No, I haven't finished!
No, I won't, Christian.
It's not just Syed you're upsetting with this infatuation.
  It's not an infatuation!
  Oh, really?
What would you call it then, huh? Huh?
I mean, it's easy for you, isn't it?
You get someone into your sights and you pursue and pursue, without any thought to recrimination.
I know, I'll seduce that pretty Pakistani boy, oh, that'll be fun!
And even though he denies you, there's no smoke without fire, that's what people will say.
And what then, huh? What then?
We could lose everything.
You have had your twisted fun,
but Syed is marrying Amira in less than an hour.
He's gone.
You've failed.
So, I suggest that you back off
and you take your perverted obsession elsewhere.
Perverted?
Yes, I'm not afraid to say it.
What you do,
it makes me feel SICK!
Well, it didn't make him feel sick.
Yeah, that's right, Zainab.
Me and your perfect son   we have done it all.
And he loved it.
