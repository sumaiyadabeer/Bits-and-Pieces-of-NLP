It's all right, Mr Grimm's tale. Evening all. Welcome to today at
conference, where the Conservatives are gathered here in Birmingham in
conference for the first time in 14 years when in power. And the mood
is a studied combination of the upbeat and the series. It's a
difficult double act, summed up in the slogan, together in the
national interest. And they don't always pull it off. Last year chaed
Chancellor, George Osborne, promised that child Ben fits would
remain a universal welfare payment. This year Chancellor Osborne said
child benefits would no longary ply to higher income claimants. I began
understand why voters might be cynical. We are preserving child
benefit, about awe justing it so the money spent on higher rate tax
payers isn't going to be spent on them. But he didn't tell thaus.
be fair, no he didn't tell you that. But I guess he hadn't had time to
think through where we go from here. We have a massive deficit. The real
problem we've got to get this cleared to. Make sure that the
burden of reducing that deficit falls evenly, it doesn't fall on
the worst off in society, we have to look at some of these benefits
that are paid to people up the income scale. There's a plan to
lower the burden of taxation that comes along progressively over the
progressively. It's far better to do that, so they don't pay so much
tax tan to get them to pay tax, recycle that money and then get it
back. It isn't a very fairway you're doing it. If there is only
one wage earner in a household and they earn £50thu a year, they'll
tick the box they're in the higher rate, they will lose their child
benefit. But if there are two people out working and they earn
say £35,000 a year, they're combined income is more than
£50,000, they don't lose their child benefit. Where is the
fairness in that? We have a taxation system that taxes people
individually. So the point that we're making here is that it will
be withdrawn at the point you hit the upper rate tax. The problem for
having two people come together is there's no mechanism to withdraw it
straight off without creating complex new systems. When the
universal credit comes in, there's a different way of doing it. But at
the moment doing it through the PAYE system, through HMRC, this is
the only way it can be done with fairness. I accept there will be
concern about that. These are real anomalies. You're not doing it to
2013, you've got three years to get it right. I agree. You're not,
you're going to penalise, if you take, I thought your party believed
in the family. If you've got a couple and the husband is out
working and earning pretty good money, loses the child benefit, the
woman is staying at home, which your party often implies is the
right thing in the early years to look after the child would be
penalised F she went out to work and he didn't earn as much, they
wouldn't be penalised, where are the family values in that? I don't
believe that the child benefit that goes to people above in higher rate
tax is actually going make a major difference to them one way or the
other on the balance of that decision. I'm not arguing that, as
you know. The balance here of that down in the lower income groups,
which is what we're dealing with, has a big bearing. Therefore we
have a choice to make. There are no easy choices here. You know that.
We've inherited a dreadful deficit. We have to try and get it down.
This is about reducing the deficit. This is the only way to do it, look
at a balance making sure we don't penalise the worst off simply out
of the way in which we just take money off them. We have to find a
waif doing. It whilst it's not an easy decision, it's a decision that
says the time for this universal credit, paid to everybody, must be
over because otherwise it costs us billions to produce. One of the
principles of welfare reform, which is the incentive side, the carrot
side, is that you should never be worse off working, that it will
always make sense to work as opposed to stay on welfare. To get
rid of the disincentive. What is the stake?    stick? You're right,
it's making sure that the barriers through work, sometimes people do
not believe they're better off, sometimes to travel to work it's
more expensive and there's a disincentive. Wee erat Kate that.
We simplify the system. They don't need an advisor spending 45 minutes
to tell them how much they retain. That's our deal. We add a work
programme that says we'll tamor it, we'll make you work ready, even how
difficult it's been in the past. The other deal is this, we expect
you to take work. When the work is available, just like in America and
others, we say you must take that work. If you won't take that work,
that's your contract, if you don't take that, we I'm afraid, are going
to say the state rapidly discharges its responsibility to you and
therefore you will start losing your benefit. More detail about
that in due course. I won't lose them overnight if I take this line,
but over time I'll lose a chunk of them? What will happen is we will
say to you, if you do not comply, the state, through the tax payer,
has bent over backwards to help you. We've got rid of this complication.
We've made sure we can get you into work, you take that work F you
don't, you have to recognise the state cannot go on paying you
benefits open ended, people earning marginal levels of income, paying
high taxes, they have to get a deal. The deal is they won't pay this
forever. Is Government capable of doing this. Do you have the tools,
the culture in your department to do this. Your department
historically just doles out the money, hence the name the dole.
Have you got the culture to do this? In America they have teams of
people, they go into houses and say why haven't you had a shower yet,
it's time to go to work. Are you ready for this? Yeah we are.
are? The key is the reforms I'm talking about, the huge welfare
reform of universal credit will make it easier for us to identify
what people are actually doing, why they aren't doing it and just to
see how hard they're working. That's what the tax payer requires.
They need fairness. Yes, you pay your money to help people in
difficulty, but you can't go on paying it forever. If there's a
chance they can get out, here's the deal, you get out. We'll help you.
If you don't want that help and you're not prepared to do, it I
don't think we have a deal any longer. Iain Duncan Smith. Today
was dominated bit speech from the Chancellor. He'd already toured the
broadcast studios in the morning unveiling his plan to cut child
benefit for higher income earners. When he confirmed that in a speech
there were no surprises. He had another major announcement up his
sleeve and that did catch most people by surprise. Before that he
emphasised what he claimed was now the widespread support from the IMF
to Tony Blair for his deficit reduction plans. He confirmed that
he was sticking to his aim of cutting the structural deficit £109
billion in one Parliament. In 16 days' time, we will publish the
conclusions of our country's Spending Review. There is a heavy
responsibility, a responsibility I feel keenly to get this right in
the national interest. If we don't get a grip on Government spending,
there will be no growth. The aspirations of many for a better
life will remain just that, hopes betrayed and not ambitions fulfiled.
The legacy that the Labour Government left us was a grave one
indeed. Britain had one of the highest budget deficits in the
world and no credible plan to reduce it. I believe that the
decisions that we together took in those spring days helped pull our
country back from the edge of the economic abyss. And it was you,
David, it was you, with your characteristic knack of sensing the
big moment and rising to it, who saw before any other person in
Britain that the national interest demanded a strong and stable
coalition Government.
You've showed what leadership is And it was Nick Clegg who had the
courage to choose the right thing, not the easy thing and helped make
it happen.
Let me take head on this completely false argument that delaying the
cuts will somehow make them smaller and easier. The truth is exactly
the reverse. Britain has a £109 billion a year structural deficit.
It's the borrowing that doesn't go away as the economy grows. We have
£109 billion of it. Labour's cuts wouldn't be smaller, they would be
bigger and last longer. In eight years' time, we would still be
meeting here, talking about what we would cut, a decade lost to debt.
That's what's on offer from Labour and my generation won't stand for
Our opponents say that I've got
ideological plans. That this whole exercise reflects a particular view
of the state. And I have to tell you, they're right. I do have a
particular view of the state. I believe in public services that
modern Government exists not just to provide resolute security at
home and abroad, but also to provide the best in education and
health care, and support for the big society. This is at the heart
of my one nation conservatism. If we're going to succeed in living by
these values, we need to understand some straightforward truths. The
first truth is that unless we reform our public services, they
will decline. Across the public sector we will squeeze every last
penny we can find out of waste and bureaucracy. Ministers have taken a
salary cut and the number of MPs will be reduced. Every department
will cut its admin costs by over a third. Some people say I was wrong
to protect the budget of the NHS from spending cuts, others say
protect the budget of the NHS just don't reform it. But at a time of
an ageing population and when the cost of medicine is rising, we know
that without both reform and resources the health service will
get worse. I didn't come into politics to see that happen.
And there's another public service we should pay tribute to, a service
built on sacrifice, our armed forces.
We have to sort out the mess that
Labour made of the defence budget and that means some very difficult
decisions, but I've been to Afghanistan this year. I've seen
the bravery of the men and women who fight for our country and I
promise you this: Whatever we ask of them we will give them the tools
to finish the job.
Iain Duncan Smith has done more than any one in our Parliament to
expose the deep unfairpbs that traps millions in dependencey and
makes millions of others pay for it. We've been working together on the
biggest reform on the welfare system since that great libual
William Beveridge. Together we've achieved what no one in our jobs
has achieved, agreement on a radically new Welfare State. I can
announce today that for the first time we will introduce a limit on
the total A benefits any one family can receive.
And the limit will be set according to this very simple principle:
Unless they have disabilities to cope with, no family should get
more from living on benefits than the average family gets from going
out to work.
I want Britain to be the home of successful, competitive and stable
financial services. I want to see genuine talent rewarded, but let me
make this clear today, we will not allow money to flow unimpeded out
of those banks into huge bonuses, if that means money is not also
flowing out in credit to the small businesses who did nothing to cause
this crash and suffered most in it. Nor will we tolerate tax evasion.
It is unacceptable at the best of times. It too is morally
indefensible in times like these. There is one more truth we need to
confront today. Britain has no divine right to be one of the
richest countries in the world. As economic power is shifting to the
East, there is nothing automatic about our prosperity. If our skills
base continues to decline, there will be no growth. If our
infrastructure remains poor, there will be no growth. If we don't
support our businesses, there will be no growth. If we don't improve
our education for everyone, our country will become more unequal,
more unfair, less prosperous. So we will give priority to spending that
supports growth in our economy. Over the horizon is a Britain that
pays its way in the world, a Britain that is a beacon for
liberty and justice. There may be moments when we can't see it, when
it seems just out of reach, but it is always there, calling us to our
task, the task of this generation, the task of the British people,
together in the national interest. Thank you very much.
George Osborne. So, benefits are to be capped which means £500 a week.
It could affect about 50,000 families on welfare. So when I
spoke to Transport Secretary Philip Hammond I asked him why should a
family living entirely on welfare get the same as a family working
for average earnings. What the Chancellor has just announced is a
very radical reform of the welfare system to put a cap on the total
amount of benefits to stop that happening. Why is that cap...
don't you welcome that? It is my job to ask questions. Why should a
family get as much from the taxpayer as a family on average
earnings and paying their taxes? Have you been asking Labour minute
any    Labour ministers should be getting far more than the average
working family? It is a start. Newsnight 27th April this year, we
have made a decision to rule out means testing Child Benefit. We
think the universalty of Child Benefit is very important. It
reassures, if you start slicing away at that, people will fear
where is it going to stop? That was April 27th. This is October. It
didn't survive more than several months. What I was talking about
there was our manifesto going into the election. We made a decision to
campaign on retaining universalty of Child Benefit... And you
scrapped it today. We didn't win the election outright. We have had
to make some tough decisions. the Lib Dems are forcing you to do
this? I didn't say that. We have had to work with the Liberal
Democrats to look at the areas where we both have priorities for
reform, like welfare, to look at our respective red lines and work
on a system which shares the burden. George Osborne said that he has an
instinctive dislike of high marginal rates. This isn't
something that he was instinctively comfortable doing... It is the
opposite of what you told us you were doing. It's not been forced on
you by the Lib Dems. You told us that universal Child Benefits were
safe with you, and they are not? Coalition Government we have
decided... What has the coalition got to do with it? Your partners
aren't making you do it? We have mapped out a radical reform of the
welfare system. George Osborne called it "a new welfare state"
that will make sure for everybody the incentive is to work, that will
cap benefits so we don't have the grotesque speck tack    spectacle
of living on earnings which are... You can get to Birmingham from
London in 84 minutes. What is the reason... Not to Birmingham and
London back... £20 billion... And you can't afford Child Benefits for
everybody? The point about building a high speed rail link is it forms
a basis of a much broader network which will go on to Manchester and
to Leeds, joining us to the west coast and east coast lines
respectively. Can we afford it at the moment, when you can't afford
Child Benefits? The other point is that between London and Birmingham,
we need additional capacity. The railway is full and whether it is
high speed or not, we have to build additional capacity. This is a big
strategic infrastructure project, the money won't start being spent
until after 2015. By which time we will have the public finances back
in good order. We cannot afford not to invest in Britain's... What do
they cut between now and 2015? budgets will be announced on 20th
October. You are not going to answer that question? I'm not going
to answer that question. It was worth a try. Philip Hammond. This
is very much a coalition conference. The raw interests of the Tory Party
are being downplayed in favour of a partnership with the Lib Dems. This
does cause anxiety amongst party activists. Today, I spoke to two of
the new Tory intake of 2010 into the Commons. I began by asking them
what is better   the Tory Government, or the Coalition?
have got a coalition. I know that. The choice wasn't between a Tory
Government and a coalition, it was between a Coalition Government and
a Labour Government. I'm glad we got a Coalition. What would be best
for Britain? There are still some differences between the
Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. I represent Portsmouth.
Defence is a big issue for us. I would never be persuaded to wear a
yellow rosette because the Conservative policies on defence
are much more sound. You will know that the backbenchers on the right
are not happy with what is going on. They feel that Mr Cameron consults
Mr Clegg a lot more than he consults them. Is that fair?
course, we are not happy in a sense that we would love to have had a
full Conservative programme. If you look at the things that the
Conservative Government are doing, most people on the right or on the
left of the party will be happy with, particularly the free schools,
getting the deficit under control, hopefully moving to a path for
lower taxs in the future. On the fundamentals, welfare reform, no
right winger would be unhappy with that. In some senses, it has been
good and there are policies... Mr Cameron need to consult you
more? He does consult with the backbench committee. There was a
meeting just before the conference recess and he went through the
various policies, so I think he is consulting with us. Of course,
people would like regular consultation   I am sure that will
happen. The danger for you is that it doesn't go too well, that the
economy doesn't recover the way you hope it does, it may be because the
policies are wrong, or because of international events. People feel
badly done by, the cuts begin to hurt, and there is only one place
for people to go   the Labour Party. Traditionally the opposition has
been spread between two. Now they have only got one place to go. That
would be very dangerous for you? think the public will judge the
Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives about how they
perform in Government. Sure. If we don't deliver, if we don't enable
the economy to recover and we don't enable our charities, and our
public services to have a more sustainable future, then yes we
will have failed. My point is the opposition is concentrated, given
that you are in coalition, the opposition could have gone to the
Liberal Democrats, the vote could have   they are not going to get a
protest vote? Of course, we are taking a huge risk in the economy.
If things go well, and the deficit is reduced, and we cut debt, that
is the end of the Labour Party. They will be the only party that
will have opposed it. Now, London Mayor Boris Johnson is always a
star turn at any Tory Conference   this year was no exception. There
was also a more serious moment when he attacked the unions and called
for tougher rules on strike ballots. I want to speak directly to the
three million people who use the London Underground network every
day and the first and most important thing to say is how
deeply I regret the inconvenience you are suffering as a result of
this strike. I say to the leaders of the unions that this gesture is
nakedly and blaitently blitical, it has nothing to do with    political,
it has nothing to do with health and safety, and I say to our
legislatures at Westminster, that it cannot be right that a ballot
can lead to strike action where less than half the members of that
union take part and it cannot be right that just over 3,000 people
should be able to hold the city to ransom, stop people getting to work
and to jeopardise our economic recovery when the measures we are
taking to reform ticket offices are an inevitable consequence of the
success of the automatic oyster card system so I must tell the
union leaders that the time has now come to ignore, ignore their
lackeys in the Labour Party, who seek to ferment unrest for their
own dismal political ends, it is time... It is time to come
to the negotiating table and sort this out. I tell all the London
travelling public that this strike will not succeed. It must not
succeed. I want to thank each and every one of the hard working
London Underground staff that have come to work. We will get London
moving because we must get London moving. London is the motor of the
UK economy, my friends, that is the point that I have been making in
the last few weeks and months to my friends in the Treasury. I will  
never mind what unpopularity   I will defend the importance of
financial services to London and the UK economy. How could I not? I
will do it even when... Even when 13% of value added. We
have the largest financial sector anywhere in the world. I will
continue to the ramparts and I will stick up for the City of London
when I am the last politician in the UK willing to do so. I tell my
friends in the City of London, that defence will be easier to mount if
they lent more to struggling businesses. If they showed...
And if they showed some sense of restraint in their pay
awards this Christmas. above all, if they made some
greater collecttive sign of their commitment to wider society. When
budgets are being cut, it is absolutely vital that these people
who are so lucky show a greater awareness of the difficulties of
those who are less well off. It is a fantastic privilege to be Mayor
of London and given what we think that we have accomplished over the
last two years, of course   and given the staggering lack of
originality that the Labour Party has shown in choosing their own
candidate for this post   it is no surprise, ladies and gentlemen,
that I want to offer myself to you again and to our party as our
candidate for Mayor of London. I say... I say to... I say
to my friends, I say to all my friends in Government, I am very
proud of you, of what you have achieved, I am proud to be standing
here to be speaking for the first time to a Conservative Party
Conference in power. It is an amazing thing to have achieved.
Congratulations to all of you and I look forward to working with you
even though the arguments may be tough. I say to my friends in
Manchester and Leeds, and my particular friends in Liverpool,
and in Birmingham, and all other compartments of the great train,
the great train ski lift, whatever vehicle you choose to imagine, all
economy, I say to you, let us defeat the union militants, let's
con du' DUP continue in our    let's continue in creating the
biggest city on earth and let's keep the great London economy
moving for the good of the UK. Thank you very much. Boris
Party managers are anxious to stress that although they are in
coalition with the Lib Dems, that does not preclude radical Tory
reform. This is not just a Government of cuts. As the
conferences progresses, you will hear that more and more. Tomorrow,
the conference will hear from the Education Secretary, Michael Gove,
from the Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley, from the Home Secretary,
