I'm Cameron Johnson. I started my first business when I was nine.
I made my first million dollars before I was 17.
You could say I know a little bit about business.
Strap in, because this is Beat The Boss USA.
We're kids. We know what we like.
I can't wait!
Who did they vote as the overall winner?
I'm Cameron Johnson, and this is Beat The Boss USA.
Today the Bright Sparks and the Big Shots
are gonna go head to head to create a brand new twist
on one of America's favourite desserts   the cheesecake.
The question is   who knows what YOU really want?
Today's Bright Sparks are Laura, Harry and Sierra.
First up, Laura, from Cardiff. She's a drama queen
who wants to steal the show from the Big Shots.
Big Shots, there's no way you're gonna beat THIS drama queen.
Next, Harry, from London, a budding animator who calls the shots,
and he's focused on beating the Big Shots.
Helping them understand the American market is Sierra, from Los Angeles.
and she plans to make waves with the Big Shots.
Woo!
Big Shots, prepare to be wiped out!
They're the Bright Sparks, now let's meet the Big Shots.
They are David, Cheryl and Ryan.
First up is entrepreneur and radio guru, David.
With over 30 years in showbiz, he hosts a technology radio show,
and is one of America's talk radio stars.
Bright Sparks, I have thought of and dismissed more products
than you are days old. You are going down. Going down hard!
Next, Cheryl, boss of a talent agency in Beverly Hills.
She's always looking for the next big thing.
I've been here for years, and believe me,
no one is gonna beat THIS boss!
And Ryan, sales manager for an international sales company.
He's driven to succeed and loves closing deals.
Bright Sparks, I close business deals before you finish breakfast.
You may as well go take a walk.
Those are our teams   The Big Shots, who are the cream of the crop,
and the Bright Sparks, who can tickle your taste buds.
Both teams have their sights set on one goal  
to win the Beat The Boss trophy. It's time to deliver the brief.
Good morning, Bright Sparks.
Morning.
Lauren, Harry, how's LA?
  Big.
  Big.
  Big?
  Yeah. Everything's big!
Good morning, Big Shots.
Good morning.
I'm excited. We gotta go out there
and show the kids who's REALLY the boss!
Sierra, how will you bring Laura and Harry up to speed on the US market?
LA's my town, I know it really well, I've been here since I was a kid.
What would be the worst brief?
  There really isn't anything we can think of.
  No. Bring it on.
Anything to do with food, really.
Whatever it is, it's gonna be fantastic, and our team is ready.
Something edible which can go wrong really easily.
Are you ready for your brief?
Today's challenge will have your taste buds tingling.
Your team must create a brand new type of cheesecake
that kids will love. It must have a whole new flavour,
and most importantly, it must look great on the plate.
Oh!
  Awesome!
  Cheesecake, whoa!
Food!
  You said the magic word, cheesecake!
  Isn't this a challenge(?)
Laura, you look a bit nervous.
I don't know what an American cheesecake is!
Cheesecake is one of the USA's top selling desserts,
with Americans munching through 700 million of the stuff a year.
There are dozens of flavours already out there,
so creating something new in this super sized market will be tough.
I'm gonna send you to do some market research.
You know what kids want, but, Laura and Harry,
use Sierra to learn the American market.
You have to get into the minds of kids
to find out what flavours they like, and how they like it presented.
You have one day to come up with an all new type of cheesecake.
Do you want my advice? Get moving.
I'm a little worried, cos I don't know what cheesecake is,
but we'll...give it a go.
My confidence shot through the roof. Because... Look at me!
You're talking about food! I mean... I can't wait!
I've sent both teams off to do their market research.
The Bright Sparks are heading to an All American restaurant
where Sierra can show Harry and Laura
exactly what an American cheesecake is.
  So that's a cheesecake?
  That looks so nice.
It's so big! Wow! Oh h h h!
  I think there might be more round...
  Oh, there's more!
  Ooh, more!
  Strawberry!
  Oh!
  Look at that one!
  This is my favourite.
  Is it?
  You gotta try that one.
  Chocolate mousse cheesecake!
  That looks so nice.
  There's cheesecake everywhere!
Laura and Harry didn't really know what cheesecake was.
But now they've been introduced to it, they know the flavours,
it'll end up being their favourite dessert soon!
Theme from "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"
The Big Shots have taken the battle on to the streets.
They aim to meet some children and find out what flavours hit the spot.
Ladies? I'm sorry, I don't want to ruin your day.
I just wanted to make it better, actually.
What we're trying to do today is figure out
the most favourite cheesecake ever for kids, OK?
There's some flavours here, I've already had a few bites of these,
but if you guys can try... Let me give you a spoon, here...
Could you taste whatever ones you want and tell me your thoughts?
Mm! That's really good! SHE GIGGLES
It's clear that cheesecake is a big hit with their target market,
but which flavours are coming out on top?
The creamy, chocolatey part.
  Cookies and cream.
  Cookies and cream? Oh!
  I'll always get chocolate.
  I'll go for the peanut butter.
I would like peanut butter and chocolate.
The Big Shots are doing a great job asking kids what flavours they like,
but they haven't asked what textures or kinds of shapes they like,
and part of this challenge is the presentation.
If they want to come up with something new,
they have to challenge how things are done.
Back at the restaurant, Harry and Laura
are about to take their very first taste of American cheesecake.
What will they think?
Fab!
I really like it already.
  That is so nice.
  This one tastes like ice cream.
  Here.
  This one is really chocolatey.
  Let's try the peanut butter.
  I like the cookie dough part.
The cheesecakes are really creamy, really nice,
but I really can't eat that much.
  Do people like strawberries in America?
  Yeah.
I think combining the tanginess of the strawberry,
but not with the original, but with the ice cream would be better.
Sierra's really helped, cos now we know what American kids would like.
It's been really useful finding out what flavours go together,
and seeing which ones don't.
  The chocolate's a bit too much.
  Too much chocolate.
Too much chocolate? More like, too much cheesecake!
Time for some expert advice from restaurant manager Brent.
  What's the top selling cheesecake?
  I think you demolished that one...
It was the fresh strawberry cheesecake.
Kids, actually, really love the cookies and cream cheesecake.
We're British, and we have to come up with an American cheesecake.
  Have you got any ideas?
  I think...anything big.
Big, like... Think of a big dollop of whipped cream,
maybe some chocolate sauce all over the top...
  So the kids really like that type of presentation?
  Yes.
  Big.
  You see a lot of nice, beautiful whipped cream dollops,
  the kids usually like that.
  So, some tasty tips from Brent.
Over to the Big Shots, who are off to a kid's cookery school
to see how their target market likes their desserts presented.
I think we should make these two the eyes and make a smiley face.
You guys are giving me a lot of colours here.
  What's the next colour you want?
  Orange.
Orange. Of course, yellow then orange.
It's like being in an art class, and having a bunch of finger paints
and the direction is, "Get as messy as is humanly possible"!
But, in all the mess, Ryan has spotted something interesting
in the way the desserts are being presented.
Sidney, you've made a little character here. Is it important
to make your food into a character so there's a theme to it?
Yeah, because it has, like, more fun, and you can...
  And... And it's fun looking at it, but then you, like, eat it!
  Yeah.
There's the mouth, and someone's smiling,
and the nose coming down. That's pretty creative.
It's clear the face theme leaves a smile on the chef's faces!
Now Sierra is taking her team mates on a shopping trip,
to see what other ingredients could go in their cheesecake.
  There's some chocolate and peanut butter.
  Do they like that?
  Yeah.
There's so much choice! Look at all of this!
Chocolate coverings, that become hard after you dip them in the fruits.
We're going up and down the aisles,
looking at combinations of flavours and textures,
which is giving us loads of different ideas.
Here we can find a combination of chocolate and peanut butter, see?
Kids really like the taste. It's chocolate and peanut butter.
  Oh!
  It's really good.
  Are Americans obsessed with peanut butter?
That's what kids here like.
  Sierra's made me concentrate on what the KIDS want, not what
  want.
Both teams have completed their market research,
but which has done enough to beat the competition?
It's time for the Brainstorm.
...hasn't been seen before. It needs to look good.
A combination of flavours would be good, and look great on the plate,
  so we have to find a good shape.
  Inside out cheesecake balls.
With the crust on the outside, but the cheesecake...
The toppings on the inside, would be really good.
Wow, they have an idea right away. Can the Big Shots match them?
So, what I'm thinking is, what if we come up with a flavour,
that is, sort of, a great flavour all on its own,
but that, we give them little samples
of, like, gummie bears...
  Like in a yoghurt shop, or something?
  Exactly. Or...
  Build a cheesecake. Build your own cheesecake.
  That's great.
  Great.
So, both teams are off to a quick start, but the Bright Sparks
are stumbling at the first hurdle,
over complicating their cheesecake balls with too many layers.
  One layer, two, three, four, five, six. Six layers.
  How did you get six?
There's three flavours   honey, strawberry, vanilla,
and there's cookie dough chocolate. But we keep changing the layering
on the inside of the ball, so that might be a problem right now.
The Big Shots race ahead. Happy with their "build your own" idea,
they're using their market research to cook up a new flavour.
  The slam dunk that we had today was the cookies and cream.
How many kids talked about cookies and cream that they like?
  It's a straight, sweet taste, right? It's chocolate and cream...
  Mm hm.
..so it's not something that would clash with other things,
  it would be enhanced by other things.
  Right.
  Right?
  Hey, Bright Sparks.
  Hi.
  How's it going?
  Good.
Our design was that we'd have a full strawberry in the centre,
with vanilla mousse, like, encasing it,
with strawberry sauce, then more vanilla going round it,
then some white chocolate, then a crust.
And is your plan to have several cheesecake balls?
  We'll probably have about three.
  How big is the ball gonna be?
It sounds like it's gonna be a basketball.
The layers of chocolate will be as thin as a piece of paper.
  Just to separate the flavours.
All right, you're off to a good start and you have some good ideas,
you just have to narrow your focus.
  I wanna make sure you have a final product. Can you do that?
  Yes.
OK, good luck.
What we learned when we watched the kids put their stuff together,
  is they love building stuff.
  Right.
  So what we'll do
is give them little samples around the plate
and call it Build Your Own Cheesecake, right?
So what we looked for was a flavour that was good on its own,
and where it could be enhanced, and that was cookies and cream.
It seems like a cop out.
Our mission is to give kids their favourite cheesecake,
so let's just give them a slice and give them every single topping...
OK, let's talk about the cheesecake. It's a new enough flavour,
and it's great, so we think it stands on its own.
Something has to be narrowed versus just bringing a bunch of stuff
and letting them make something, so let's iron out the details.
The Bright Sparks have decided to simplify their idea,
but they have another problem   they need a name.
  The Trio cake?
  Oh! SIERRA LAUGHS
  OK, it's inside out.
  Inside out... Inside out trio...?
  The Inside out Trio.
  I think we've found our name.
  The Inside Out Trio.
  The Big Shots are nearly done.
They're deciding how to arrange the toppings
  for their Build Your Own Cheesecake.
  We're doing a round cheesecake now,
that we've settled on, right? So if we do, one, two, three, four...
Like a smile. Right?
And maybe we make the strawberries and whipped cream as two eyes.
Bright Sparks, pitch me your idea.
Inside out Trio. A tasty cheesecake from the inside out.
Have you created a great product? Will you win?
It'll either be really good, or it'll completely stink!
  Yeah, a disaster!
  You've got a great product,
now you're gonna have to pitch your idea to a leading American company
who will produce it. You can either win it or lose it in the pitch.
You've got a great story, but if you can't tell it, you won't sell it.
  So have you got a product?
  We call it My Own Cheesecake.
The eyes are the whipped cream and the sliced strawberries,
the nose is the big piece of cheesecake...
  This is your absolute best idea?
  We think.
  Think isn't good enough.
The Bright Sparks' Inside out Trio has three balls of cheesecake,
and the Big Shots' My Own Cheesecake has a face shaped design.
In preparation for the pitch,
the Bright Sparks created some colourful visuals,
but the Big Shots have gone all out and baked their own prototype.
The pressure's on as both teams must now pitch their ideas
to The Cheesecake Factory, America's leading cheesecake company.
They'll be pitching to Phillip, the company's big cheese.
It's time for the teams to come face to face.
The Bright Sparks have nothing to bring to the table like ours.
We'll blow them out of the water.
My message to the Big Shots is, "Hard cheese, you're gonna lose!"
  Hi.
  Hey. How are you?
  Good.
  You're shorter than we pictured.
There's one and a half of you there, right?
Yeah, well, we're the Bright Sparks, I'm Laura, this is Harry.
  I'm Sierra.
  And you're the Big Losers, right(?)
  The Big Losers, yes(!)
  Losers!
  You're the small losers.
  Before the trash talk gets too serious,
Phillip tosses a coin to decide who will pitch first.
  Who's gonna call it?
  Heads, cos ours are obviously brainier.
We can allow that to happen.
  Heads it is!
  Heads it is.
What does that mean? We're gonna go first? Awesome.
Big Shots, you can come with me, Bright Sparks, you have to wait.
Joining Phillip in the pitch is Vice President of Operations, Keith.
All right, Big Shots, give us your pitch.
We're excited about creating something for kids
that's a very unique experience for their own.
Each individual kid will have their own unique experience,
which is very interesting. That will not only brand your cheesecake,
but brand an experience, which is what life is about.
It seems Ryan has forgotten the first rule of pitching  
get to the point!
Life is not measured by the breaths that you take,
but by the moments that take your breath away...
While the company bosses,
and his team mates, wait for Ryan to get on with it,
the Bright Sparks are using their extra time to fine tune their pitch.
Gentlemen, I'd like to present to you...
My Own Cheesecake!
Now, the construction of the cheesecake consists of...
Cookies and cream is, of course, the top,
and it's mixed with a cheesecake... Just a normal cheesecake.
You know...what seems to work historically
is if the product looks great,
um...you know...
people eat with their eyes first, so it needs to look really appealing.
Your brief was to come up with a whole new flavour.
and being as smart as you are,
I feel that the flavour you produced today is rubbish.
Cookies and cream has been done a number of times.
I suggest you go back to the table and think of a different flavour.
The comments... In my opinion, I don't feel were negative,
I think they're constructive comments
that we can actually do and improve on our idea.
So, despite a negative reaction,
the Big Shots are looking on the bright side.
Can the Bright Sparks do any better with their presentation?
Hi, we're the Bright Sparks...
  And we're here to pitch our...
  Unique, original product to you.
Our idea is called Inside out Trio.
Tasty cheesecake from the inside out.
The three flavours of our cheesecake balls are vanilla strawberry,
cookie dough chocolate, and honey nut.
So let me show you what our product would look like on the plate.
Sierra?
There would be three beautifully decorated cheesecake balls,
with delicious sauces drizzled delicately over each.
Here's a model that actually shows the size of what it would be,
and the different layers that are on the inside.
Tasty cheesecake from the inside out!
The end.
Well, it's quite a sophisticated idea.
Very unique and upscale.
I'm concerned about the size. If this is truly meant to represent
your protocept, your example, I think three could be quite a challenge
for somebody to eat after their meal.
They gave us good feedback, some of it was positive, some was negative.
After both pitches,
which idea has impressed Phillip and Keith the most?
If we can actually make the Bright Sparks' idea,
I think it would be great and well received.
The product with the strongest potential is the Bright Sparks' idea.
So, the Bright Sparks have edged ahead,
but the Big Shots are determined to get back on track.
Not only have they revamped their presentation,
but now they're working on a whole new flavour
with cheesecake guru, Alan.
I think for something that you guys want to add a lot of...
Have a lot of other options to add to,
it needs to be more neutral, like something more vanilla...
So let's say we wanted to use our vanilla,
let's use our plain batter here, then caramel will go with a lot,
and it doesn't have to be really heavy on caramel,
  just an after note...
  You can tell that caramel's there.
I'd definitely put some type of vanilla mousse on top of that,
and give it a lot more creaminess to it,
like an ice cream, it'll be like an ice cream.
We're gonna go with the mousse, the caramel notes and vanilla base,
and it'll be given a sort of ice cream feeling to it.
The Bright Sparks have decided to size down their cheesecake balls,
but there's a question mark over one of their flavours.
I like it, but I don't know what kind of broad appeal it may have.
If you really wanna use honey... It's a great flavour,
but I think it needs to be more of a secondary flavour.
Maybe something more familiar, like a butterscotch or a caramel,
maybe, say, butterscotch honey, that might be something that might be...
  "Oh, I'll try that".
  That would taste better.
Taste the honey and then maybe the one with butterscotch.
  It's, like, sticky and sweet.
  What worried me today
was when we were going to add butterscotch to the honey.
but when I tasted it, it was really good and I think it really works.
I think that's a nice combination, you guys had some great ideas,
and I can't wait to put it together for you guys,
  All the best.
  Thank you.
We've worked really well together, we've all made good decisions,
so we're gonna win.
I'm confident that we'll beat the Bright Sparks,
I just don't think they have a candle to hold to us.
As the day draws to a close, what does Phillip think of the designs?
If I had to make a decision now,
on everything I've seen and all the hard work that's gone into it...
I'd have to pick the Bright Sparks.
But the final decision lies with our 25 expert judges.
It's decision day.
Both teams are on their way to the Beat The Boss USA headquarters
to find out who's won.
We did all the right things, so hopefully they'll like what we did.
I'm about to see the product for the first time. I'm really excited.
I'm not sure what it's gonna turn out to be like.
Where we would have gone wrong, possibly...
  I don't think we went wrong!
We're confident in our product. I think we'll win.
If we lost, I'd be gutted to fly home as the losers.
I have a feeling we're gonna win, as we stuck to the brief,
and we're kids. We know what we like.
Welcome to Beat The Boss USA's headquarters.
This is the big moment that you've all been waiting for.
We'll start with the Big Shots.
There it is.
  Wow!
  Wow!
  That is awesome!
Do you think we're looking at the winning product?
  Yeah.
  If not, it's something I'd like to take home with me!
  Let's see if it tastes as good as it looks.
Dig in.
Oh, wow...
  Bright Sparks, are you hearing this?
  Ew!
What do you think, Harry? Do you like the idea?
I like the concept, but they could have added a few more extras.
  That's what the Bright Sparks think.
  That's coloured by the competition.
  Let's see what they've created.
Guys, you've seen the Big Shots' product,
Harry, are you still confident yours can beat them?
Yeah. I like their product, but I'd like mine more.
OK, why don't we take a look?
  I like that.
  That looks so nice!
  Oh, my gosh!
That is perfect!
  Laura, what do you think? Do you feel confident you've won?
  Yeah.
  We're definitely gonna win.
  Big Shots?
  Yes?
This is their idea. They have an inside out cheesecake.
It's a great design, but it's not gonna win.
  It looks too big for a kid's mouth.
  Let's see how it tastes.
Go ahead, try it.
Oh, my God! That is so good!
  Mm!
Well, both teams, you're obviously very confident in your product,
but what matters is what the target market thinks. So have a seat,
  and let's see what the 25 judges had to say.
We asked our 25 judges to test both products.
To make it fair, they had no idea who designed which one.
First, it's the Big Shots' My Own Cheesecake.
You can customise it however you want.
The flavour's like paradise, like nothing I ever tasted before!
I really liked it, because it was like Kid Heaven!
You've, like, got cake and chocolate and gummie bears...
Cool. Awesome.
I liked the look of it, cos it was, like, a smiley face.
There was nothing I did not like about it. Everything was perfect.
And what did the judges make of the Bright Sparks' Inside out Trio?
  You're mine now!
  Gimme it, gimme it!
  Delicious.
  Mm...!
  I love the strawberry.
  Mm!
I think it's really good. It was really creamy.
I like the insides. They're just like...an explosion of flavour.
It's hard to eat, because it's, like, in a little ball form.
My favourite flavour was the chocolate. I loved that.
Time to vote.
Well, you saw what the judges had to say. Big Shots,
they loved that it could be customised,
but they thought the vanilla as quite plain. Bright Sparks,
they loved that yours had several flavours,
but said that some of the balls were a little difficult to eat.
But who did they vote as the overall winner?
I have that right here.
The winners...
..of the Beat The Boss USA...
..cheesecake product...
..with a tasty 19 votes...
  (Wow...)
  ..to six...
..are...
..the...
  Oh!
  Gosh!
..Big Shots!
The bus is air conditioned!
Big Shots, come on over.
May I present to you your trophy. Congratulations. Great job.
There's a limo waiting to whisk you off. I'm gonna go with you,
and, Bright Sparks, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to take the bus.
  Bye! Enjoy the ride!
  Bye!
  Bye(!)
Big Shots, congratulations, you've done it,
you've defeated the Bright Sparks. Cheers!
  Cheryl, are you surprised?
  I'm not surprised.
I was really confident, and I just knew that this was a kid's product.
I'm really surprised, because we lost to a bunch of losers!
The one thing I thought that we might have been a little conservative on
was the flavour.
Big Shots, you did a great job, but we'll get you next time!
The biggest thing about becoming a businessman or a businesswoman
is to do what you love, and the money will follow,
and you guys didn't.
Yeah, good job(!)
Boo!
  We'll get you next time!
  Enjoy the bus!
I can't believe you beat us, Big Shots. Any chance of a lift?
