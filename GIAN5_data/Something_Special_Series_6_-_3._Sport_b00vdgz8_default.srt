Mr Tumble! Mr Tumble!
Lift your hand.
Just like so.
Move it around and say, "Hello!"
Hello!
Hello, hello How are you?
Hello, hello It's good to see you
I say hello
Let's go out to play
I say hello
Let's go out and about
Out and about
Out and about today.
Hello, Mr Tumble.
Hello!
What are you doing, Mr Tumble?
I'm looking for my trainers.
Your trainers, Mr Tumble?
Yes, my trainers.
Are you going to do some exercise, Mr Tumble?
Yes, I'm going to do some exercises.
Whoo hoo!
Wow, is Justin going to be doing some exercise today, too?
Yes, Justin is going to be very sporty with his friends.
Ooh, can we go with Justin and his friends?
  Yes! Wait...
  Wait, Mr Tumble? Why?
I want Justin to look for three special things.
Look inside the spotty bag, Mr Tumble, to find out what they are.
Ah! Good idea.
Wow! A trampoline.
A ramp.
And an ice rink.
Three special things.
Is that something else we have to find, Mr Tumble?
It's me!
Put it in the bag then, Mr Tumble.
Don't forget the magic, Mr Tumble.
  Magic?
  Yes, magic to send the bag to Justin.
I...I mean...I...
Ah, yes. Magic!
  Will you help me?
  Take your finger.
Touch your nose.
Blink three times.
And off it goes!
Ah ha! Look.
Mr Tumble's spotty bag. Thank you.
Hello, I'm Justin. Let's go and meet my friends.
Let's go and meet my friends.
Well, I've got my trainers on and it's time to get sporty.
Hey! Hello, everyone.

  Tyrone. Hello, Tyrone.
  Hi.
Hi. Good to see you.
Are we all ready to get sporty?
Yeah! All right, then.
Now, what sport shall we do first? What do you reckon?
Hm...
That's a good idea but I think we should look inside Mr Tumble's...
  Spotty bag!
  That's right. Come on. Are you going to help me, Sophie?
That's it. Turn around.
Wow! What is it?
  Trampoline.
  That's right. A trampoline.
  But where shall we look for...
  There!
I think Sophie knows.
  Let's look over...
  There!
  ..there.
Where's the trampoline?
It's somewhere here.
When you see it, wave or cheer!
Well done. You've found the trampoline.
Can you see the trampoline?
Yes, there's the trampoline.
It's time to sign.
Ah, look. Trampoline.
You sign trampoline.
  Trampoline.
  Well done!
  Trampoline.
  Well done. That's right, Sebastian.
Look, trampoline.
My friends love to bounce up and down on the trampoline.
Whoo!
Wow, look!
This looks like it's great fun.
I'm coming, Claire. Hang on.
Don't laugh!
Right, are you ready?
Whoo! Yeah!
  Hi, Sophie!
  Hi.
Sophie's bouncing really high in the air.
Right, I'm going to see
what Sophie and Tyrone are doing.
Whoa! OK. Wow!
We're going really high now. One, two, three!
Hi Tyrone. Whoo!
Sophie's bouncing so much!
Tyrone and I are bouncing high up into the air, aren't we?
Phew! I'm exhausted.
Well Tyrone, now which sport shall we do next? Hm...
Shall I go and find out?
OK, I'll go and see Claire and Sophie. See you later.
Hey guys. Wow.
That bouncing was great fun, wasn't it?
Yeah! So, what sport shall we do next?
Let's have a look inside... Are you looking after the bag?
..Mr Tumble's spotty bag.
Sophie, what's this?
  It's a ramp.
  That's right. It's a ramp.
Now then, what do you think, Claire? Where shall we look for a ramp?
Ah ha! Let's look over there.
Where's the ramp? It's somewhere here.
When you see it, wave or cheer.
Well done, girls.
You found the ramp.
Can you see the ramp?
Yes, there's the ramp.
It's time to sign!
Ah, look. Ramp.
You sign ramp.
  Ramp.
  Well done!
  Ramp.
  That's right, Sebastian.
Look. Ramp.
Tyrone is pushing the red stone down the ramp.
Off it goes!
Can he get the red stone inside the target?
Oh ho!
This game looks great fun, Tyrone.
Can I play?
  Yeah!
  Thank you.
Ready, steady, go! Off you go.
Yay! Well done, Tyrone.
Go! Will Claire's blue stone make it?
Yes!
It's my go now.
I got it onto the target.
Nearly in the middle.
And now for Sophie. Go!
Oh, yes!
What was that noise?
Mr Tumble!
I think you might be right.
Let's look inside the spotty bag and find out.
  Look, who's that?
  Mr Tumble.
That's right. Shall we all call for him?
OK, are you ready? After three, as loud as you can.
Why don't you join in too? One, two, three!
Mr Tumble!
  Hello, Mr Tumble.
  Oh, hello!
What are you doing, Mr Tumble?
I'm putting on my trainers!
But they're not trainers, Mr Tumble. They're flippers.
Flippers?
Yes, flippers.
Ooh, wait!
Ah ha! My trainers.
Well done, Mr Tumble. Now you're ready start your exercise.
Yes, I'm ready to start my exercise.
First, Mr Tumble,
you have to do some star jumps.
Ah! Star jumps. Good idea.
They're not star jumps, Mr Tumble.
I don't know what to do!
Don't worry. We've got a good idea.
Granddad Tumble!
OK then, boy. You want to see the old star jumps, do you?
I've been doing those since 1903. Stand back, might get messy.
  Thank you, Granddad Tumble.
  That's all right, boy.
That's enough star jumps, Mr Tumble. It's time for your next exercise.
My next exercise?
Yes, Mr Tumble. Next you have to do some press ups.
Ah ha!
That's not a press up, Mr Tumble.
We've got a good idea.
Aunt Polly!
Oh, hello!
Please could you show Mr Tumble how to do some press ups?
  Some press ups?
  Yes.
Oh, all right then.
Down. Up. Down. Up. Down.
Up. Down.
Thank you, Aunt Polly.
That's enough press ups, Mr Tumble. It's time for your next exercise.
Hello, Lord Tumble.
Oh, hello!
Please could you show Mr Tumble how to do some jogging?
Why of course I can.
  Ah!
  Thank you, Lord Tumble.
What's the matter, Mr Tumble?
I'm tired and thirsty.
Look, Mr Tumble.
Granddad Tumble is having juice and there's a glass for you.
It's over here, yeah.
Before you go, Mr Tumble,
please could you teach us the sign for sports clothes?
Yes.
Look. Sports clothes.
You sign sports clothes.
Thank you, Mr Tumble.
You can go and get your juice now. Bye bye, Mr Tumble.
Bye!
Mr Tumble is funny!
Mr Tumble makes us laugh!
We've got one more sport to do.
And, shush, this one is extra special.
They're going to love it. Watch.
Let's look inside Mr Tumble's spotty bag again, shall we?
Hang on a minute, what's this?
  Ice rink.
  That's right! It's an ice rink.
And guess what? We're all going skating!
  So, where shall we look for an ice rink?
  There!
Good idea! Let's look over there.
Where's the ice rink?
It's somewhere here.
When you see it, wave or cheer.
Well done! You've found the ice rink.
Can YOU see the ice rink? Yes, there's the ice rink.
It's time to sign.
Ah, look. Ice rink.
You sign ice rink.
  Ice rink.
  Well done!
Ice rink. Round.
That's right, Sebastian.
Look. Ice rink.
  Hey, Ryan! Can I have a go?
  Course you can.
Ready, Tyrone? Off we go!
Whoo ho!
Tyrone and I are having great fun. Whoo hoo!
His wheels are spinning really fast.
Ready, steady, go! Here we go.
Hey, Claire, how you doing? Whoo hoo!
I've got you now. Yay!
Whoa! Out of the way.
Whoo!
Yay, whoo hoo! How about that then, eh?
I'll tell you what, everyone...
Phew! We have had a fantastic day, haven't we?
Yeah. And you three were so good at ice skating.
In fact, I've got something for you!
I've got a medal each for you for being so good.
Well done! OK.
One for you, Claire. There we are.
Well done! One for you, Tyrone.
There we are. You've done very well today.
And one for you, Sophie. Well done!
What's that noise?
You know what? It's time to go.
How about we give the last medal to Mr Tumble?
Yeah? For doing all of his exercises.
  Bye!
See you soon!
Whoo...ooh!
Whoo hoo!
Well, it's time to send the spotty bag back to Mr Tumble.
Are you ready?
Take your finger and touch your nose.
Blink three times.
And off it goes.
My spotty bag! Thank you.
Look inside, Mr Tumble. There's a present for you.
It's a medal! For me!
Thank you!
