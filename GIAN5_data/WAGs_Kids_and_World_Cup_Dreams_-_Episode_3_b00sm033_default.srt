This programme contains some strong language.
Four years ago, the biggest story of the World Cup
was what the wives and girlfriends
of the England team got up to while their partners were on the pitch.
'The WAGs, as they've become known,
'are now the main attraction in Baden Baden.'
But in 2010 these five WAGs have been working in the host nation
of this year's World Cup, South Africa.
  It's so upsetting.
  And discovered an even bigger story.
I just never believed that things were that bad, you know?
The plight of hundreds of thousands of orphans that the players
and their supporters will never see.
Life is shit. Proper shit.
So far they've tried to
cope with the huge numbers of abandoned orphans of Cape Town.
There's just so many! You just don't know where to start.
And helped rescue some of the thousands
of young girls forced into prostitution in Johannesburg.
One player's week's wages,
what that would do in a place like this.
But their next job is even tougher.
OK, I don't feel comfortable here.
People are getting upset about the camera.
The girls are about to meet the boys.
Beyonce!
Johannesburg has over 20,000 boys with no money,
no food, no family and no home.
Do you have sex in here?
Working to rescue and protect them will be Imogen Thomas,
former Big Brother housemate and ex girlfriend of Jermaine Defoe...
It's very scary. I'm actually quite frightened talking here.
..Chantelle Tagoe, partner of England striker Emile Heskey...
You walk into a room full of teenagers,
you can see some of them giving me the eye!
..Ellie Darby, partner of England defender Matthew Upson...
It is a case of 24 7 talking about trauma, feeling that trauma...
..Amii Grove, glamour model and on off
girlfriend of ex Liverpool midfielder Jermaine Pennant...
I know lots of people that have been on crack, heroin...
..and Elen Rivas, ex of England star Frank Lampard.
If I was to go and walk around, anything would happen to me?
You can get raped or killed.
  Nice.
The girls have had a brief chance to rest before their next assignment.
Getting energy levels up, I need plenty of sugar
to get me through the rest of the day.
They've spent the night at Johannesburg's Melrose Arch Hotel,
a five star venue that will play host to the footballers and their
partners at the 2010 World Cup.
The thing I'll miss most is room service.
And not having to do any cleaning,
I can make as much mess as I want.
But for these WAGs,
working for nine days straight in the real South Africa
is beginning to take its toll.
How are you this morning?
Shit. Not very good.
And they've got to start work again, in less than an hour.
Shit.
Waiting for them is their new boss Heloise Sakira
who's been co ordinating charity projects for Johannesburg's poor
for the past 15 years.
Like the WAGs, she's known a wealthier existence but has turned
her back on privilege to dedicate her life to helping the homeless.
I believe you girls had quite a nice break, hey?
Well, your luxury it is just starting, coming with me now.
Just imagine, we're going to have some nice fun.
I believe you've been with street girls, working with girls
on the street. I work with boys.
We have roughly up to 20,000 street boys, just in Johannesburg alone.
They've got nothing.
They've been thrown away, they've got no self respect any more.
We've got to make their lives better. I'm trying to get them
off the street, trying to put civilisation back in to them.
They don't need to go out and steal and do crime.
If I start off now with them as young as they are they can learn values.
How do you relate to these children?
Have you been there? Because I sometimes find it difficult.
You don't need to be in those circumstances
to be able to feel they are feeling.
You've got to have this mind right
now when we leave from here, I am going to step out of this world
I'm in and I'm joining Heloise into her world.
Forget about the nails, forget about everything else.
You've just got to get into it and do it. If you haven't
found anything after this thing is over then I don't know...
  But I believe you're going to find something.
  Find what?
You're going to find a reason for living. So, let's go,
let's get ready for this world.
The girls are heading back to Hillbrow,
Johannesburg's most dangerous neighbourhood.
The majority of the buildings here are derelict. They are used
as shelter by the city's tens of thousands of homeless people.
But during the apartheid era these apartment blocks were
the modern homes of Johannesburg's affluent white population.
Black people were banned from most of the city
and when apartheid finally fell in the early '90s, the black population
rushed to reclaim Johannesburg in search of a better life.
The whites fled for gated communities
in the suburbs, taking their business and money with them
and leaving their previous homes empty.
Today, almost all are run down squats without power or sanitation
and there simply are not enough to cope
with Johannesburg's homeless epidemic yet every year
thousands of young boys head here
believing a life in Hillbrow must be better,
having been abused or orphaned in the lawless rural townships.
Most end up on the streets.
What time do we have to get up?
To get up, 4am.
  You're joking!
  It's real life. 4am.
From now on the WAGs will be working
to give life changing support and perhaps rescue some of the
district's 20,000 street boys from a life of homelessness,
drug addiction and prostitution in an area that sees 11 murders a week.
  This is JKK.
  That's where we're staying.
Amii and Elen will be living and working at the JKK shelter.
Say hello to the ladies.
Hi, ladies!
It was set up in 2003 as a safe haven for 32 former street boys.
Staff here are also a lifeline,
feeding the homeless boys of Hillbrow that JKK can't take in.
It's very homely.
We tried to make it as homely as possible for them.
But it's a centre in crisis.
Cuts in government funding have led to staff shortages.
Amii and Elen are expected to plug the gap.
This is where you guys are going to sleep.
  Lovely.
  Amy is being employed as a supervisor,
waking the boys up at 6am, helping them with their homework,
and she has to remain on duty until they go to bed at nine.
  What's the outside of here like?
  It's very dangerous.
Elen has been put on the food runs.
Risking work outside the JKK shelter.
If I was going to go outside and walk around, anything will happen to me?
You can get raped, or killed.
Nice.
Bye.
  Hello, how are you?
  Fine, how are you?
Heloise is sending Imogen, Ellie and Chantelle
to work with Dudu Mowasi,
co ordinator of the Twilight children's shelter.
Twilight is an organisation that works with kids who are living
and working on the street, so basically we take the ones
who are under 18, provide them with skills, life skills,
unify them with their families and provide shelter for them.
Twilight is home to 65 former street boys. The 6 to 18 year olds
sleep in dormitories and have to stick to strict rules.
No drugs, evening curfews and they have to go to school.
For the next three days, the girls will also be living here,
working long hours with some of South Africa's
most vulnerable children.
Each of them will have a different role.
Hi.
Hi!
And as part of the housekeeping staff it is Chantelle who has the
first chance to meet the boys.
You're walking to a room full
of mostly teenagers, you can see some of them giving me the eye!
It felt a little bit uncomfortable.
But they're all really nice.
Thank you very much.
But that could be about to change.
Ellie has already been sent to start her first shift
in Twilight's kitchen.
  It's so dangerous!
  It is.
For the next three days she'll be supervised by head chef
and former street boy Pastor.
  So what time you come in the kitchen in the morning?
  5am.
  So I need to be up at about 4:30am, yeah?
  Yes.
  I think you should take off your glasses.
Imogen is on outreach duty, and will help attempt to rescue street boys
when Dudu and Twilight staff think it's safe to leave the centre.
What washing should I do, then?
For now, Chantelle won't be going anywhere.
  The boys' school uniforms have to be washed.
All of it? And the blue as well?
All 65 of them.
Elen may have only just arrived,
but she's already been told to leave the safety of the JKK shelter.
This, you know, you're supposed to have fun.
You're supposed to be enjoying what we are doing.
Heloise has organised to collect food donations...
Highly blessed and highly favoured!
.. to take to the homeless boys in the city.
Bye bye.
I'm on the street the whole day.
I'm on the street because I like to be on the street. I like doing this.
She comes from a good family, she's been privileged all her life.
She gave up basically everything
just to come here and work with the children.
One of the few ways street boys make money is washing car windscreens
at traffic lights.
Hey, come! Tell them to get some food.
I made pap'n'stew. Come and fetch.
But they rarely make enough to afford to eat properly.
  Ex, yeah.
  Frank Lampard?
What kind of guy is he?
  He's good.
  He is good?
Don't disrupt my lady.
Go, son, before I get angry.
Oh, ma'am, I want to play football in England, ma'am.
That was my dream. That was my dream, to play in England, ma'am.
We're going to play soccer nicely one weekend, OK?
  Yes. You said he is a good guy?
  Yes.
Because you are a good lady, you are a beautiful woman, you have anything
that a man could want from a woman.
That's what is shocking me.
But things happen, sometimes you just don't get on.
Like how?
Can you explain to me?
No, I don't want to explain to you.
Because I want to know, you must tell me.
Look, lady. This is a history in the making.
I have never met an ex girlfriend of a football player.
That's why I'm asking you. Maybe he did some of
the things that I do with my girlfriend.
  That's why I'm asking you.
  No.
We just didn't get on.
Didn't get on? How didn't get on?
Elen had hoped that working in South Africa
would help her get away from gossip surrounding her
failed relationship with Frank Lampard.
I wish I come back from South Africa and I'm...
I'm like a new woman and I move on.
Move forward.
Look at him! So cute.
And, despite throwing herself into helping the country's orphans...
Break ups are not good, you know?
I was with the guy for a long time, and we loved each other a lot.
The split still plays on her mind.
It's hard because we had lots of plans for the future.
We planned another baby and things like that.
But what can you do?
Shit.
I'm not talking about him any more. Let's go, come on.
Don't be angry, sister.
I'm not angry, it's just the door.
No, I'm not answering any more about that.
You like it or not, this is where it is.
I understand you are very angry right now, and that
you don't feel like saying anything.
Did you know that the quickest way to get them off your back
is to answer everything as nicely as possible?
And don't worry.
'I thought I was connecting with her in quite a bit of a way,'
because what she is going through, I went exactly through the same thing.
I actually can touch and feel her pain.
She was married to a famous footballer.
I was married to a rich guy.
They can be very manipulative.
She has got all this anger bottled up inside.
What I'm doing now has helped me overcome.
So maybe this can also help her.
I will ask God to help us cross this bridge, because this is a bridge she
just has to cross. She has to cross it before she leaves South Africa.
The WAGs are halfway through their first shift.
While the JKK kids are at school,
supervisor Amii is responsible for the daily shop.
I might go to bed!
Over at Twilight, housekeeper Chantelle
has finally finished the washing.
She's just got all the ironing to worry about.
You know what? I don't mind ironing, actually, at home.
But it's quite different ironing for 60 boys instead of my own two.
Ellie is yet to leave the kitchen.
  Tired?
  No, I'm good. Good exercise!
I'm going to have big muscles when I go home.
I'm moving the pot, look.
But head chef Pastor isn't interested in Ellie's muscles.
  I've got the same eyes?
  Yes, I like it.
  Are they nice eyes?
  Yes, they are nice.
He said he likes my eyes, I said, "Are they nice eyes?"
  She has beautiful eyes. She's a model!
  I like her eyes.
  She's got long eyelashes.
  Yeah, OK.
Thanks, Pastor(!) See you later!
I was wondering if I could go and shower, or whether
you needed me to do anything else?
No, it's OK. I think she will dish, and then you can...
Oooh, have fun!
Enjoy my dinner. Enjoy it.
Ellie has had to cook the daily staple, known as pap.
  Thanks.
  Okay.
A mixture of maize flour and water, served with pilchards.
And she's had to make enough for 65.
It is like school dinners, there are so many people to cook for.
But they get quite big portions.
So that's good, it keeps them full.
Lots of pap!
Excuse me, is the food good? Is it good?
'Did you enjoy cooking?
'Do you know what, it's been amazing.'
To see them all eating my cooking,
going, you know?
I don't think they're that fussy, though, babes!
Thanks(!)
That is it. Whatever's on the menu is on the menu, there's no choice!
  You have nice writing.
  No, come on.
It's like a girl's writing.
At JKK, the new supervisor is helping with the boys' homework.
I think we only use 25% of your brain.
That's something you learned today, boys.
Tomorrow I'll have something new.
But 17 year old Pumlani wants to learn as much as he can tonight.
  How many boyfriends have you got?
  I had two.
I've only had two.
Only? For real?
I'm staying single until I meet the right person.
Because the third one I want to be the man
that I hopefully marry and have a family with.
  Oh, man.
  So I'm waiting for the right one.
I've got to get my game together.
You know what I do back home, yeah?
I'm a, I'm a like, I'm a model.
I do lingerie and swimwear.
I believe you. I've seen you.
No, I am, I tell you! I'm a Page Three girl as well for The Sun.
Doing topless for The Sun.
You are? Top, top, wait, topless?
Topless, yes. So I model my...top.
I'm loving this!
You guys, share the chocolate and grapes. Yeah?
Elen is in charge of getting the younger boys to bed...
Lollipop? What do you prefer?
..whose interests are a little more innocent.
It is a bit difficult in here,
because everything is about the football and about the boys.
You know? It's a bit like... Because when I'm at home,
I don't talk about him as much as I talk in here.
We're here because of the World Cup and blah blah blah, so it makes it
that bit more difficult for me.
None of us wanted to break up, but you know, sometimes if things don't
work out, it's better to live apart.
In the end, it wasn't comfortable, you know?
And when it's not comfortable, when
you don't want to see his face and he doesn't want to see your face...
It hurts, the break up.
Break up hurts.
That's why it hurts.
Morning!
It's yet another early start for the WAGs, and the boys.
Wake up.
If I've got to come back again, I'm bringing a bucket of water. OK?
  A bucket of water?
  Yes. Get up!
This morning is the start of the girls' first full day
cooking, cleaning and caring for over 100 boys.
Having washed all the boys' uniforms, and ironed them...
..Chantelle just has to work out whose is whose...
Deke?
  Thank you.
  You're welcome.
..in time for school at 7am.
A mile away at JKK...
Breakfast?
..it's an early start for Amii and Elen as well.
I'm not used to being with so many boys.
But even though Ellie has finished cooking the breakfast at Twilight...
Yeah, that's enough? No?
..her kitchen shift has only just begun.
That's right,
we are making bread now. Come, I'll show you.
The boys get through 30 loaves a day.
To save money they all have to be made from scratch.
Yeah?
Why isn't mine looking like yours?
Why doesn't mine... Maybe I need some flour?
I think Pastor is amazing.
I think he has an infectious personality.
Very happy, very friendly.
Ellie isn't the only WAG to impress.
I used to don't think I lost the focus
I tried to go back and forward like I was a locust...
Elen, yeah, she is an angel.
If I was old enough, I'd ask to marry her or ask her out.
But I'm just a young boy.
Beyonce!
I think that's resolved.
  Imogen is hoping to make a different impression.
  Is that OK?
Shall I wear a vest underneath?
No, no, it's fine, that's OK.
Dudu is about to take her on her first outreach mission.
When you approach the boys, the first thing that you do, I will show
you the way we greet. We greet this way.
This way.
Come, I will show you. It's one, like this.
  This clips here.
  Oh, like that?
  Yes.
  Yeah.
  OK, let's do it again.
Normally you are going to be
forced to sit down on the floor with the boys and have a chat with them.
  Are you ready to do this?
I'm ready, yeah. I'm ready. Thank you.
Twilight's aim is to build relationships with boys sleeping
rough, draw them away from the streets and into the shelter.
This is a very dangerous area because of a lot of drug lords.
Alcohol, there are a lot of pubs with alcohol and stuff, you know?
So, a very dangerous street in Hillbrow, actually.
So, we are turning that side.
That is where normally our boys hang out.
She's taking Imogen to meet a group she's been trying to
  befriend for the past two months.
  We find a lot of dead bodies.
Last week, Wednesday, there was a boy who was stabbed.
I think it was here. Yes, it was here.
He was stabbed, like, six holes.
And then they cut his throat. So he passed away.
So this is what is normally happening in this street
with these young boys.
This place is very rough.
It's very scary. I'm actually quite frightened talking here, especially
with cameras in front of me, because I think that's a target.
I feel quite uneasy here.
There's actually a fight going on behind me right now.
This is quite frightening, so I'm just going to step out.
Imogen arrived in South Africa broken hearted
after splitting with England striker Jermaine Defoe just days earlier.
Rumour has it that the England striker, 27, was cheating on
gorgeous Welsh lass, Imogen, 26.
Feeling emotionally raw,
she struggled to look after 35 babies in a Cape Town orphanage.
Have you got pink trousers?
I'd like to do something else, to be honest,
I just find it really draining to be here with 35 kids constantly.
At the same time as dealing with the break up.
It is hard.
We haven't spoken since I got here.
He didn't text me to say good luck.
And three days hard work and round the clock filming in
a shelter for abused women pushed her over the edge.
You can't expect me to stand in there for 15 hours, or anywhere in this
place, and work constantly when I'm actually dropping on the floor.
I'm sorry, but you know, it's not fair,
you're not treating me right here, at all.
Cracking up on the streets of Hillbrow
could have serious consequences.
  So this is...
  These are the boys?
Yes, our boys are living and working in the street.
And don't forget our greeting, eh?
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Imogen's job is to help Dudu to
convince these street boys to come to the Twilight shelter for food.
Meet Imogen.
You can sit. You don't have to be shy and stuff.
  Oh, OK.
  So this is Lucky.
  Lucky?
And these are the others I am working with.
  You don't need to be panicked, they won't do anything, don't worry.
  They're just friendly people.
  He's naughty.
  He's naughty?
  I am sorry.
Why's he naughty?
  He smokes dope.
  Oh, he smokes dope. Oh.
How did you end up living here?
You lost your parents? Oh.
Do you ever have dreams about what you want to do with your life?
Actually...
..my dream...
Can you tell me one of your poems? I'd love to hear.
Oh...
I think there's a life out there for you. You're very intelligent.
I think you've got a lot to give.
It's difficult for them. People don't take them as human beings.
They think they are thugs, criminals but they don't know that they've got
talent, they are capable of doing something, you know, in life.
How old are you?
  Yes.
  How do you get money?
Do you want to come back to Twilight for food?
You know the little 14 year old,
I don't understand why he just won't sleep
at Twilight?
Does he just prefer the streets?
He prefers the street because he is
normally taking drugs.
So when he's in the centre there are rules that they shouldn't smoke
and they shouldn't bring drugs in the centre.
So he can't take that, he always runs to the street for that.
OK, cool.
Guys, I'm going to go now. I'll see you at Twilight for food, yeah?
  Yes.
  OK, cool.
I'm good, I'm good, amn't I?
I'll see you later.
Yeah?
Even though most of the kids from JKK are at school,
there's no break for Amii.
Jamma.
How are you? I'm good thank you.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
OK, cool. After you.
Short of staff, the shelter have sent her to work with
the rehabilitation officer Jamma.
He tries to help street kids who are addicted to drugs get clean.
They have come to Joubert Park which is well known for drug use, to try
and find a teenager called Xolani.
He wants me to stay here.
OK, I don't feel comfortable here.
People are getting really upset about the camera.
I'm starting to feel a little bit uncomfortable and a little at risk.
There seems like a lot of violent people shouting at us.
Jamma. Was the people upset?
No, they wanted to know why they are getting filmed, you see?
Would people approach me to hurt me?
No.
  Maybe can we walk on the pavement along?
  That's fine.
  Yeah. Will there be drug addicts in the park?
  There is plenty.
  Yeah?
  Yeah, there's plenty.
Sure.
Xolani!
Hi, Xolani.
  This is Xolani.
  Nice to meet you.
For a short while, Xolani tried living at JKK
but struggled to cope with the discipline and returned to the
street where he could take drugs.
D'you sleep here?
On the track?
Under the bridge?
Like many street kids, Xolani smokes a drug called Taiwan,
a cheap and highly addictive mixture of heroin and cannabis.
With the drugs, do you feel like the drugs is your only friend?
I know lots of people that have been on crack, heroin, lots of drugs.
Young like you, 17 or 18.
And you need to tell yourself
rehab will help you so much, but in here, in here, you need to
tell yourself that you don't want to, you want different.
When you believe and have faith that you want different,
than that's the only time you are going to let go from the drugs.
Do you understand what I mean?
I feel like I almost want to shout at him for ruining his life.
He wants to go to rehab which is a massive step for any person who is
addicted to drugs.
But... I don't know.
It's just horrible, isn't it?
I have spoken to Jamma earlier and tomorrow we are going
to take you to a rehab centre.
So we will meet you at 10 o'clock.
  Promise?
  Yeah.
Show me... Do this.
In England, we say promise.
That means promise, you can't break that. It's bad luck.
  Now they have fish tomorrow.
  Perfect.
On her second daily food run, Heloise has taken Elen to one
of the most squalid camps she visits, known as The Mountain,
where the people say they have been driven to squat on
the hillside because of the World Cup.
There's the stadium where they are going to have the soccer.
They used to live in derelict flats near the new £180 million stadium.
But neighbouring buildings were demolished when construction began.
All these people that were in those houses now have nowhere to live.
They've broken down all these houses here.
They have broken everything down.
Which locals believe was done to hide the slums and poverty
from teams and visitors.
This is my mountain.
Afternoon, afternoon, afternoon, afternoon!
  How are you?
  I am blessing you. Afternoon.
All these broken down places here, right? People have been thrown out.
And they have been
thrown away from society,
they have come here and they've made a life for them in the mountains.
Children, adults, everywhere.
They are now living like animals in the mountains.
You can't stand here, Elen, you've got to go up with me.
Check that out. Look!
Wow. It stinks.
Those that were evicted when the slums were cleared have been living
on the hillside for two years.
  Hello.
  Hi.
How are you?
You guys must try and make a plan, to pick up some of the rubbish
at least around here.
Crazy, crazy mountain.
There was a baby born in here.
This is amazing. She was born in here.
Everyone drinks.
It's just crazy, the way people live.
What can you do? Can you leave from here, can you go somewhere else?
Can you go to a shelter or a church?
You can see the stadium.
  Yeah.
  Now you see what happened, they wanted tourists to see how
beautiful Johannesburg is, the very beautiful country city.
But this, they don't show the tourists.
The money they used for the World Cup there,
they could have used to make the houses better for the people.
Some teenagers still try to scrape a living here as male prostitutes.
  Do you guys live here?
  Yeah, we live here.
Show them your place, man.
They have a beautiful apartment. Let's go through to their apartment.
Where do you guys do your business?
As in pee pee, where do you do that?
Anywhere?
Oh, hello!
Can I lie down? Oh dear.
Come and lie with me.
Let's do this.
Do you have sex in here?
Oh.
But with boys, right?
  Yeah.
  You don't like girls?
So you wouldn't fancy me?
Sorry, I'm really bad.
Madam Gigi?
Fifi?
Why did you end up here? Why?
And now, can I ask you how do you get your money?
How much you get? How much you get?
150 per night?
We brought some food, OK. We've got food in the van. OK.
Definitely, yeah.
Bread.
Bread. Bread.
Bread.
Bread for you, Mama, for the baby.
Let me give you more pap.
It is never enough, no.
It will never be enough for them. They will always come for more.
It was just crazy just going up there and the way people live.
They are starving, there's killing, there's people dying cos they're...
they're ill.
There's gays, there's prostitutes, there's transvestites, drunks.
  It's a tough world. That we live in.
  Very tough. Very crazy.
I am moved. I am moved.
  Are you?
  Yeah.
  Would you be able to do this every day?
In a normal living?
  Yeah, I could do it.
  You could?
  Yeah, I could do it.
  Come and stay in South Africa. You one of a kind.
  Not everybody could do this.
  Yeah, honestly I could do it.
You have a heart, your heart is big enough you can.
Ellie's been working for 12 hours in Twilight's kitchen.
So far there's been no complaints.
They are on seconds so it must taste nice.
Ra, it was fantastic it was very nice
that I have ever had in Twilight.
It is very nice. Especially the sausage.
I like it very much. It was very fantastic.
At JKK Elen and Amii are responsible for making sure
the younger boys are in bed by 8.
I didn't expect all this.
And I really like the experience. You know, I learn a lot.
Um...
I don't know how I feel when I get back home,
because it hasn't sunk in because I am really into everything.
So...
yeah,
it's been a,
it's been a rollercoaster in here.
Good night.
  Thank you very much.
  Adios.
The WAGs are preparing for their 11th early start in a row.
  It is so cold.
  I'm tired.
Getting up so early.
We're up at 4:15am. So, yeah...
better get some sleep.
Can't wait to go to bed, to be honest.
  Bye.
  Bye bye.
It's the girls' last full day of work in Johannesburg.
I'll miss it when I go home.
I've been so used to being around loads of people.
I'll get home it'll just be me, with Matthew...
But Ellie's boss, head chef Pastor
is more concerned about him and Imogen.
So, Imogen.
  Yeah, Imogen.
  That's you.
Time?
Oh. Yeah. Of course.
I don't know. Maybe like later.
  Later?
  Yeah, cos I'm busy with the kids now.
  Even me, too, I'm busy.
Oh, I basically, oh I think he's so sweet.
D'you know what I mean Pastor's so sweet, but...
I'm not interested in anyone at the moment.
And he's a lovely guy, don't get me wrong,
but...not my thing.
He's not my type.
  That work?
  It's crazy.
  Did that wake him up?
  Sure.
Amii has returned to Joubert Park
to meet Xolani, the drug addict she met yesterday, to take him to rehab.
I can't see anybody.
  Shall I whistle?
  Xolani.
Xolani!
I think I should go down.
Oh.
OK. I'll wait here.
This way?
We're looked in the park for Xolani
and we've looked in the usual drugs spot where his friends are.
And nobody seems to know where he is at the moment.
So, fingers crossed we'll manage to find him somewhere.
Maybe he's off his face and doesn't even remember
he was meeting us today. I don't quite know the reason, but...
it's life, isn't it? There are some people you can help
and there are some people you can't,
Xolani's somebody who...
can only help himself now.
I've said that all along, he'll only be able to help himself.
I felt so passionate about what I was saying yesterday
and I felt I made a lot of sense.
But there is nothing I can do now.
I feel quite upset, really disappointed.
For Amii, failing to deal with drug addiction and homelessness
stirs up painful memories.
My stepdad became a crack addict.
He was very violent towards us and stuff.
My brother, bless him, my stepdad didn't really like him
so he couldn't come back to ours, even if my mum had wanted him there
so he started to sleep rough, wherever he could.
It must have been crazy for him and now when I think about it,
from meeting Xolani and stuff.
And, um...
one time my friend said to me,
your brother's down the park under the bridge.
So we went down and there he was with his bags. I was like, what you doing?
And he was like, I haven't fucking got anywhere to sleep, have I?
He never used to go on about it.
Amii's brother was tragically killed in a motorbike accident,
just as he was starting to turn his life around.
When we lost him, we went through bad times.
And my mum just never spoke about it.
She just...
She just, like, blanked it.
But for me,
I think about him every day and stuff.
Just dead proud of him.
Imogen is on her final outreach assignment.
It is her last chance to help Dudu convince street boys
to begin a new life at the Twilight shelter.
I would never put a homeless person on the street in London
but it is just interesting to see what actually goes on here
and this is like a new set of boys where we're off to now.
I want to see if there is any way we could persuade them
not to live on the streets any more, really.
Is this where the boys are?
Oh!
Under the tunnel, yeah?
  They're not there?
  No, the gentleman is telling us
that he found some mattresses inside
and some blankets.
It shows that maybe some boys slept there.
Maybe they have just gone out. They have to go out
next to the shops and try to get some money.
  Will we go and look for them now?
  Yes, we are going next to the shops.
Bless them, you've finally found them and they are lighting a fire
just to keep warm at the moment.
They are obviously running away now.
They don't want to come. Why are they negative towards the shelter?
In the shelter we've got rules and regulations.
They don't have to smoke drugs, they don't have to smoke glue or benzene
so they don't want that.
They want freedom, to move around, sleep where they want,
eat what they want to eat.
Dudu has persuaded some boys to travel back
to Twilight for the food.
It is cold today, isn't it?
I'd be so pleased if those boys stayed here.
Today is freezing, it is absolutely freezing.
They're in shorts and T shirts shivering.
Why should they be like that when there is this place here?
They need that chance. They're young,
they need an opportunity and this is the perfect opportunity for them.
But once they've eaten, there is a problem.
You don't want to stay here?
Why?
  I'm fine.
  You are fine, what d'you mean you're fine?
It is cold today.
It is cold, you are feeling hungry, everything is so rough there.
Here you can get a better life.
Twilight staff face this battle every day.
A chance.
I think if this little boy stays the rest of them will
because they're friends and they do what he does.
I think that's the problem with these two.
Do you think so?
Are you warm now?
Are you warm? Yes, good.
Heloise has brought Elen back to the mountain
for their final food run together.
Before she leaves, Elen has brought a present
for the two boys she met yesterday.
Whoa!
Woh!
It fits you perfect. Turn around.
I'm going to go down and feed everyone, all right?
Are you guys feeding everybody?
  Yes.
  OK, let's just do it.
Coming! Coming, coming!
OK, I'm going to see you guys tomorrow.
Girls, when you go out, have a drink for me, OK?
I'm so proud of her. I enjoyed every bit working with her.
  Are you OK?
  I am just so proud of you,
knowing that you can walk up there,
  it just shows it doesn't matter how much money you have got...
  I don't!
That you can just blend in like this up here.
That you...
I have seen another side of you. I don't know the other side but this
is the side I will always remember.
Bye! Thank you!
  How are you? Do you feel nice and clean?
  Yes.
You as well? Feel good, yeah?
At Twilight, three of the boys that Dudu and Imogen rescued
have decided to stay.
Handsome boy!
Here, that fits as well.
Her final job in Johannesburg is to get them settled in.
Socks? Where's your socks? You have picked your beds already?
Where are you sleeping?
At the top or the bottom?
You sleep on the top.
Are you warm? Do you want socks?
Put your socks on. Leave your socks on.
Don't put them back on. We'll put them in the wash.
'I'm really proud of them and they are happy as well.'
And this little boy, he did not want to stay at all.
He said he was going back and he was the one
who ran away from us at the very start.
For him to pick his bed and be excited about it, it just says a lot.
It says it all.
They look like different boys, to be honest. They do.
They are full of life now. Look at this one, doing his bed already.
It says a lot.
The girls' long shift at the shelters is almost over.
We have had the best time here.
Every one of you have touched our hearts
in a special way and we just want you guys to keep positive
and keep going because we know that you have all got bright futures.
Just seeing these children who have got nothing.
Their clothes don't even fit them,
their shoes, their feet are hanging out of their shoes
but they're just so happy.
I'm never going to complain about anything ever again.
When I was with Frank I never worked or anything.
I was doing other things but not working, as such.
So I think now, for me, it's time to do other things.
Something else, you know.
I can't just be a full time mum.
  Nice to meet you.
  Nice to meet you too.
And we will stay in touch, yeah?
Oh, you know...
I didn't have a chance to tell you, but to be honest with you...
Serious. Serious.
'It's put a lot into perspective for me.'
It was only 10 days ago when I got off that flight and
I obviously was feeling quite fragile.
I had only just broke up with Jermaine as well.
It has been 10 days and I'm a totally new person.
I just feel a lot stronger. I was thinking, why was I even upset?
This place has turned it around. It is the best thing I have ever done.
The WAGS may be finally leaving Johannesburg
but tomorrow morning, there will be yet another early start
as they tackle the toughest job they have had so far.
Next time:
Let's go to our house.
The girls travel to rural South Africa.
I can't bear this. I don't want to live there.
I don't feel comfortable sleeping there tonight.
People come here to die.
All the head office died of HIV.
Fucking hell!
Rat!
In the worst conditions they've faced so far.
There's are a lot of fleas.
  Did you see that?
  It is just not any way for people to live.
