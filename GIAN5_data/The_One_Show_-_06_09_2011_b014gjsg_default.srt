Hello and welcome o the one Show. With Alex Jones And Matt Baker. One
year after snake hips backfliped his way across the dance floor, you
will meet the 14 celebrities about to don their sequins to impress the
Strictly judges. Although you mange you know who they are, nobody is
see you. Great. I thought the entrance was brilliant. A bit more
extension in the arms though! going to do the backflip. When were
you told the names then, Len? three hours ago. Can I tell you
something, I'm so excited, I could pickle my walnuts, honestly. I
think the line up is fabulous! It is Absolutely Fabulous. It is good
and we know who it is. To try and keep the Strictly dancers a secret,
the production team give them appropriate codenames. Like last
year I was cake, Baker   bake a cake. We'll meet the first four
contestants, but firstly, here is As the celebrities prepare to be
judges in our legal system to be on television too. The Prime Minister
wants cameras in the courtroom, but where would that believe a very
special breed of artist who call the courts their home? We've all
seen the vibrant sketches of defendants in the dock, judges
passing sentences and even celebrities protesting their
innocence. But, what few people realise is that creating these
images requires not only artistic talent, but incredible powers of
recall. Courtroom artists spend most of
their working lives in court waiting for the perfect moment of
emotion, excitement or drama to portray. But they're not allowed to
draw in court, so have to memorise every detail. With the aid of a few
for the tough deadlines of the news bulletins.
Julia is one of only a handful of courtroom artists working in the UK
and has captured moments of history. From cases involving Premier League
footballers to the trial of General Pinochet. How long do you have to
create a piece of work? One of the most challenging ones was 10.30 in
the morning, I had to have a drawing to be filmed for the 1
o'clock news and into the dock filed 13 alleged hijackers. They
were varying heights, some had a moustache, long hair, short hair.
It's showing the differences that makes the drawing more interesting
to show people what it was like in the courtroom, people who aren't
able to get in there. You can use your imagination and visualise
yourself sitting somewhere else in the court. I might even put myself
alongside the judge and see the court from his vantage point.
you ever been in a courtroom where you have had to capture the image
of a famous person? Many, many times, yes. George Michael,
Geoffrey Archer at his libel trial and then the purgery trial. John
Terry. Quite a few footballers, sportspeople. That puts added
pressure on you because everybody knows what they look like or at
least have an idea of what they think they look like but I use the
same approach with everybody, I want a good resemblance no matter
who it is, whether it be Joe Blogs or somebody very famous. The art of
courtroom sketches began with the 1925 Criminal Justice Bill which
banned any images from being made in court. After 18 years as a
barrister, there's not much Harry Potter QC doesn't know about
British law. Harry, how did it come about that cameras aren't allowed
in the courtroom? There were a succession of notorious cases from
1912 until 1925 which seemed to exemplify the worst fears that the
Government had of the excesses of the press, perhaps most dramatic
was the trial of Seddon, a particularly notorious murderer.
The judge put on the black cap and sentenced him to death. It was
precisely at that point that a photograph was taken in the court.
This caused quite a lot of disquiet because, of course, this was the
high point of the case and the drama. Criminal cases such as those
led to the Government inserting clause 41 into the Criminal Justice
Act which finally came into force in December 1925. This prohibited
the manufacturer of photographs and pictures, as well as the
publication of them. In other words, a complete ban. Isn't it time that
they allowed photographs and cameras in court now? There are
fears, perhaps exemplified by the experience of America. When OJ
Simpson for instance was on trial, there seemed to be a lot of history
that we wouldn't expect in our court. If that sort of mode of
conducting a trial came in as a result of bringing in cameras, the
very dignity of the proceedings would be undermined.
Introducing cameras to the courtroom would dramatically change
the public face of the British legal system. In the meantime,
artists like Julia are plying their trade with compassion, patience,
speed and considerable artistic talent. Totally surprised to hear
that those artists do it all from memory. Incredible. You spend a lot
of time in America where the trials are all televised. Do you think
it's a good idea? I have watched court TV and, to be honest, the
majority of it is so boring because it's all the preambling. I suppose
if it's a nitty gritty and gets maybe down to the last day that can
be of interest, but to have it on, it's really boring.
Something that certainly isn't boring at all. All this week, we
have been following David Walliams as he swims down the Thames to
raise money for the Big Splash. struggled through day one so had
ground to make up as he started this morning. Day two of Walliams v
the thems and David's in Oxfordshire for another day's
swimming. The weather's not great, but it's going all right.
Despite battling torrential rain and harsh winds, he's delighted
with the support he's been receiving. So cold isn't it? Yes, I
wouldn't recommend it. It all seems a bit stupid now. Thanks for coming
out to support me. David hoped to do 21 miles today and make up lost
water and finish in Abingdon. The late sest that he should complete
it by 8 o'clock tonight. He's raised ï¿½145,000 so far.
That is two days down, only six to go. He needs your support. Go to
the website for details on how to donate and David, you can find out
where he'll be over the next week. The weather is awful. That's why
he's swollen because he's so cold. Time to reveal the first four
celebrities in zans, 2011. Do remember their codenames were Wasp,
Twist, Queen and Star. Let's see if you guessed right. A drumming Wasp
from McFly, say hello to Harry Judd. Oliver Twist's Nancy Dalol owe.
Giving us a twirl codenamed Queen, she ran the Vic, Anita Dobson and
Russell Grant, the Star behind you. Could that be a sign. Listen, I'm
so excited about all this, I really am. I can't wait, I really am!
Older contestants have done well so what do you think it is about
dancing which means that all age groups can compete? I think the
older celebrities, I don't think they quite go... More mature shall
we say? More mature is nice. They take it for what it is, they don't
get the intensity, they get great intensity with their partners and
that's the thing, you know, you don't have to be fit and 23 with a
six pack to do well. As much as the judges will be the critics, you
know, the audience are there cheering them on. Four more names
will be revealed very soon. Work out who they are from these real
codenames used by the Strictly While you have a think, let's check
back in with our photographer Jamie Crawford, who all week is going to
extraordinary lengths to take pictures of British wildlife.
This is Kings Mill Reservoir in Nottinghamshire, home to a huge
range of water foul. And for an area so full of wildlife, it's
surprisingly close to the centre of town. But, just off the beaten
track. Down through here is a little offshoot called the
Hermitage Reserve, which for my money, is even nicer.
Fed with water from the main reservoir, the Hermitage is an
Oasis of calm and is also home to a colony of herons, the subject of
today's photograph. John is a wildlife expert who's
been filming the herons since they arrived unexpectedly several years
ago. What is going on in the nests at the moment? It's springtime and
obviously what is going off is eggs, chicks, parents feeding young.
it's a hive of activity? problem is, these herons are
nesting at the top of some very tall trees, meaning taking a
picture from the ground is almost impossible. I need to get above the
nest so I can look down into them and that way, hopefully, get a
cracking action photograph. And a scissor lift does just the
job. This has been up here for three days sothe herons can get
used to it. The best time to photograph them is at the crack of
dawn. We're going up. These herons are preparing for eggs and chicks
and, although this noise isn't disturbing them, I don't want to
push it. George Osborne is giving me just one hour to get my shots
before he brings me down    John is giving me just one hour. It's 12
I can see four nests. It's the most fantastic perspective. It's a
heron's eye view. They don't seem to mind that I'm here and they're
getting on with their morning routine.
Wow, wow. Some are busier than others.... For much of the year,
herons feed on their own, but I can see why they come back here to mate.
Right by the water, plenty of food. Fantastic spreading branches that
they can nest in. Full on. Once a female chooses her mate, the male
selects a nesting site and supplies her with everything she needs to
build it. It's literally bringing back sticks and giving them to her,
planting them where she wants them and making them a proper home.
Might be a bit greedy, but I'm really desperate to get one of
those fantastic taking off shots. But my hour is nearly up. Go on.
Take off! We're going now. Last chance to get
There is no way that you can get a better view than this of a heron's
nest. Don't forget the camera.
I just had the most amazing time. Thank you so much. I can't
believe... Thank you. I can't believe that you get this kind of
wildlife action in the middle of town. They have chosen this spot
and it's because of that that they're so happy. We are not
disturbing them at all and that's marvellous. That one is the one to
finish up on, two nest building herons. Really nice.
Speaking of photos, we have dug out this little beauty. Don't! 1973 Len,
you look fantastic. Look at the hair as well! I was trying to work
out what dance were you doing there? It was like the freestyle
and I was like a dirty old man and my partner was a stripper and she
had a dress on with all these handkerchiefs, chiffon and she
flicked them off and gradually we got together and there it was, yes.
Fantastic. Let's leave it there. you think if Strictly would have
been around in the '60s, would you have been one of the dancers?
if they'd have asked me. 100% if they'd have asked me, I would have
been there. Do you sometimes feel like getting over the desk? No, you
wouldn't want to see my dance, you would frighten the churn. Far
better I sit behind the desk. But if I would have been asked when
competing and dancing, I would have taken it like a shot. I guess you
would have felt protective over your celebrity because a few
professionals have a go at you guys. Would you have been the same?
definitely would. I would have been the 1960s Brendan Cole I think. Not
as aggressive as sometimes he is forwards his partners. You've got
to treat your partner with a bit of kindness and respect and bring them
along and you have to think you're a team and act like a team and
you're together in this. So if the judges were a little bit harsh on
my gorgeous partner, whoever that would have been, I would have been
at her defence. You are a genius with your turn of phrase but you
put a lot of that down to your grandad? My grandad was a proper
cockney barrow boy. He was always coming out with humorous little
quips, most of which I couldn't repeat. When he moved into judging,
not many people know this, but you know a lot to Erin the dancer,
don't you? The BBC virtually had their panel of judges and they
still weren't sure if they'd got the right one and they asked Erin,
can you think of anyone else from the ballroom world that we could
ask and she said this one and that one and we've tried that one, what
about old Len Goodman, have you given him a go and it was who's he
and anyway, I got the call and up I went and oh, I was so excited, I
was excited, you know, dressed up particularly gorgeously and in I
went to this little room and they kept putting on videos and saying
what do you think of that cha cha  cha and I would say they're
filleted in the arms and this and that and whatever. When I came back
out I got on the train, I thought, I'm not going to get this job, two
days later I got the call, we'd love you to do it. You have been
there for nine series. Eh! I love Erin. And you are judging in
America now? Yes. Is it different over there? The show the the same,
you've got the judges, the band, the Bruce person, the Tess person,
and basically, it's the same. They're a bit more razzamatazz over
there and there are hundreds of standing ovations, they're up and
down, clapping and screaming, but no, they're very similar over there.
Can we expect any changes to Strictly this year? That is the
other thing that's excited me. on then? Midway through, Wembley
Arena, 6,500 people to watch you dance. The finale, or the final, is
going to be in Blackpool, the home of dancing, which I think is great
for the final. A lovely feeling in that place. Yes. Plus a new hunky
dancer. I've seen a picture. Pasha the Siberian Tiger. Look at him! He
has a six pack and everything, I'm telling you. Let's find out who he
could be dancing with. Time to reveal four more Strictly dancers,
Lily, Sloane and Ivy. It's footballer Robbie Savage. Sloane's
the code, let's see the face. It's Waterloo Road's Chelsee Healey. Who
rose like a Lion? Rory Bremner, that's who. He does a good Brucie.
Who is the Ivy over there? Aussie actress singer Holly Valance.
So Rory Bremner, if he does an impre exceptional of you, will you
mark him down? I think I'm quite easy because I have this slight
impediment with Rs, prawn, prune, prat, anything like that. I'm sure
he'd get me off and Bruno, looking forward to him doing him. What
should the celebs be doing to prepare at this point then? Well,
they should be quaking in their boots a little bit I think. I think
they should be trying to build up their energy and get themselves fit
because, you know, it is a gruelling affair, you know, you're
going to be practising for three, four, five hours a day, so you've
got to be fit, focused and you've got to go into it with the attitude
that I'm going to enjoy the experience and I think that's the
key, go in and enjoy yourself. At four dancers will be revealed
soon, so here is the next set of Who could they be? Something
different. Electric cars haven't exactly got the best reputation,
not least with our friends upstairs from Top Gear. Lucy Siegle believes
she's found a car in Lancaster that could change all of that, but not
even is on board. Normally there'd be more chance of
catching me in the cycle lane than the pit lane. I've never been too
keen on the damage petrol heads do to our environment. All in all, I'm
probably the wrong person to ask to spend the day racing in a ral Lee
car, but it turns out this machine is different    raleigh. This nifty
one litre motor is the world's greenest raleigh car using a fuel
efficient petrol and a tuned hybrid system. Not only is it
environmentally friendly, it's extremely powerful and in the world
of motor sport, it's also incredibly controversial.
Can you explain how this technology works? Is it petrol or electric?
The answer so that is it's both, it has a petrol engine, an electric
motor and a gear box. When the car is accelerating, the petrol engine
and electric motor work together to give it more per for mons. The key
to their success is not just maximising the petrol and battery
trifen motors, but also new technology that harnesses energy
normally lost when the car slows down    driven motors. We are using
high performance batterys that can hold more Power than a standard
hybrid brat tri, then we have a system of controllers that allow us
to harness energy efficiently    battery. We are increasing the
rates of the flow of energy between the front and back of the car where
the batteries are. O so proops it's surprising to find that many motor
racing enthusiasts are less than enthusiastic about hybrid
technology    or perhaps it's surprising. You like to hear the
sound and smell of the petrol. just doesn't sound like a clean cut
idea. I like it to be that or that but not half and half.
expensive and I don't think they represent value for money. Despite
the fans' misgivings, when the car was first developed, race officials
were prepared to let it complete in the Formula 1000 Championships.
When we first started competing six years ago, it was almost a Jock, a
radical looking shaisship car and it was very slow, but very quickly,
we started untapping its potential    spaceship car. We were becoming
competitive within five or six rallies. Soon there were calls to
ban the hybrid. The whole point of the Championship is that it's meant
to be competitive. If it stops being competitive, it renders it
irrelevant for the fans and competitors alike. The hybrid was
reclassified and it was asked to leave the competition. Do you think
you are being penalised for your success? Well, yes, it's hard to
take. This year was our big chance for glory. But we don't want to
upset the other competitors. In fairness to most of the other
competitors, they've come out very strongly in support of retaining us
in the Championship. More engineering innovation's come out
of the British Isles than anywhere else in the world and I applaud the
guys but the problem is, it's too damn good and making everyone else
look daft. So I may have started the day as a reluctant rallyer, but
I'm starting to come round. It's not all about petrol or driving,
it's the technology too. Here the race to win could produce
engineering breakthroughs that might improve all our lives. We've
had over 100 miles to the gallon out of it. So you will save money
and have an effective car at the same time. Could we see this
technology under this bonnet being under the bonnet of a normal care
in a normal driveway? Absolutely. Thanks, Lucy. Let's reveal the next
four celebrities to be judged by Len. Glove, Fire, powder and Love.
The Gloves are off to reveal loick gold medal winning boxer Audley
Harrison.    Olympic. Lulu, the coldest Fire to relight Len's Fire.
Who is next? These lips are never sealed. Edwina Currie. Curry powder.
Who is this laid back love? Day break's Dan Lobb.
A bit of thigh slapping there, not so much on Audley Harrison though.
Lulu, Edwina Currie. What's going on? Audley Harrison is 6'5", size
18 feet. Oh! I cannot wait for Saturday night when they get paired
up with who they're going to get. You know, after that, they've only
got three weeks and then the first live show. The pressure...
Fantastic. It's on. How frustrated do the professional dancers get
with you? Well, they sometimes get a little frustrated with me but
I've known all of them for many, many years, I've judged them as
children and professionals, so they know that I'm only speaking with
honesty and really, if I critique, it's really just to help. I don't
ballroom person that tries to get a bit of the technique into the
dances. We've revealed 12 of this year's
Strictly contestants. Now it's time to meet the 13th, codenamed Dundee.
from Down Under, it's Jason Donovan. So, here are all of this year's
Strictly celebrities. What a lovely bunch they are. But hang on, have
we missed one? Number 14. It's Bridges. I think we can all work
that one out.
I feel so nervous and so sick. I've only had two days of practise and
my arms are just aching, Len. I don't mean to complain...
Never too soon to panic, use know. I'm hoping you are going to get the
Siberian Tiger. Oh, hot, hot. the Welsh dragon as well. Who knows.
I'd be happy with Matt Baker as my partner. Wasn't he good? Just those
flip flops. I was thinking James or Brendan even would be good. I think
somebody that can obviously lift her up. Do you know Len? I don't
know at all. What would be your gut instinct? Well, I... It's all to do
with height really and I think, you're nicely sized and shaped, you
know and everything is nicely proportioned. I'm almost tempted to
hang up my judging thing and get out there with you. That could be
you! One of the busiest celebrities with working and all that. Remember
that, Len, I've got a full time job. You are going to be under pressure.
You can see how Alex and the other contestants find out who their
partners will be on the special launch show this Saturday and 6.10
on BBC One. Who would you like it to be? It's
