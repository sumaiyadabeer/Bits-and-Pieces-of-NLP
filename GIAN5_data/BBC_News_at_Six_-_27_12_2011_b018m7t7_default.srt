Prince Philip is back with the Royal Family after four nights in
hospital. A thank you to medical staff, a wave to well wishers and
on to a quiet time at Sandringham. Police defend their handling of
yesterday's Oxford Street murder. They arrest 11 and appeal for
mobile phone footage. Thousands of Syrians protest as

Good evening. The Duke of Edinburgh has left hospital and re joined the
Queen and other members of the Royal Family at Sandringham. The
Prince, who spent four nights at Papworth Hospital, thanked staff
for the excellent care he had received during his stay. Officials
say he is incredibly cheerful but no decision has been taken on how
soon he will resume public engagements.
It had been a moment of real anxiety on Friday when he had been
admitted to hospital with chest pains. After three full days and
four nights, the Duke left Papworth with a wave and feeling very
cheerful according to Palace officials who were with him. He
re join the Queen and the rest of his family. It will be much to
their relief and to his that he's out of hospital and back with them.
What we don't know, of course, is whether he's returned home with any
explicit advice from the doctors to adjust his workload. The Duke
remains remarkably active for someone in his 90s. He pursues many
interests of raise own   carriage driving for example and roles
within the military. His most important role is to support the
Queen. His presence is of great significance to her and as we
approach the Diamond Jubilee year, wits programme of visits to many
different parts of the UK, with its programme of visits to many
different parts of the UK, the Queen will be hoping nothing
prevents her husband from accompanying her. The Duke will
want to play as full a role as possible at the Queen's side as he
always has. They have been together now for 64 years. Duty has always
come first. But now perhaps they will feel that safeguarding their
health should assume a greater importance.
Anthony Bartram is outside Sandringham. It's a busy year
planned ahead. When do we know about the Prince's public
engagements? I think that is something that the Palace will have
to look very carefully at and consult at some length with both
the Queen and Prince Philip in the coming days to see how well he is
recuperating. Thankfully, at this time of year, the Royal Family does
tend to come here to wind down and relax a little so that will help
him stick to the doctor's orders and just take things easy and rest
up over this period. We know that his first formal engagement isn't
until mid January with his first public engagement coming in
February. So he does have some time to rest up. But, clearly, next
year's schedule with the Diamond Jubilee will have to be looked at.
You would imagine that Prince Philip will have quite some say as
to how fully a part he plays within that accompanying the Queen. Thank
you very much. 11 people have been questioned by
police investigating the murder of a youth in Oxford Street in Central
London yesterday. A postmortem has showed that the 18 year old, named
as Seydou Diarrassouba, was killed by a single stab wound to the heart.
Police are appealing for any video footage taken at the time.
Stabbed in broad daylight, this is Seydou Diarrassouba who was killed
on London's busiest shopping street. This video captured on a mobile
phone shows the aftermath of the incident as officers tried to hold
back a curious and sometimes agitated crowd while paramedics in
the background try to save the teenager's life. When the incident
happened shortly before 2.00pm yesterday, police cordoned off the
road as thousands of shoppers flocked to the West End looking for
bargains. Police investigating the murder are appealing for witnesses
to come forward, especially those who may have captured the crime on
camera. Certainly, there was people in the store and several outside
the store who filmed either part of the incident, or the aftermath of
the incident. We are interested in any of those people coming forward.
Footage such as this has emerged on the internet showing fighting on
Oxford Street yesterday, although it is unclear if it is connected.
Police have recovered a number of weapons from the scene including
this knife. Just hours after Seydou Diarrassouba was killed, another
young man was stabbed in the leg just up the road at Oxford Circus.
He survived the ordeal. Police don't yet know if the incidents are
linked. As for the safety of shoppers, they say there is a high
police presence but they are reviewing whether the number of
officers needs to be increased. Arab League monitors have carried
out their first mission outside the Syrian capital. They have been to
Homs, the scene of the worst violence during the nine month
uprising against President Bashar al Assad. Jim Muir reports from
Beirut. The Arab observers were awaited
especially in Homs. This is one of several districts that have seen
repeated efforts by the regime to crush defiance, but it is still
there. When they reach one of the hottest areas, Baba Amro, the
observers found themselves besieged by angry residents eager to bend
their ears and tell their story. Even as they were talking, gunfire
rang out. Although the violence died down compared with recent days,
residents of Homs said that even when observers were there people
were still being killed or martyred as activists call it. There are
more than five people wounded and eight people have died by the
security forces shooting directly at this innocent people. In another
city to the north, there was more shooting as protesters tried to
converge on the central square to stage a big demonstration. Under
the Arab peace plan, peaceful demonstrations are supposed to be
allowed and certainly not shot at. The plan also calls for all Armed
Forces to be withdrawn. In places like Bathwick Bear and Homs, tanks
have been used to shell residential db like Baba Amro and Homs, tanks
have been used to shell residential districts. The first day has
produced mixed results. They have had their first taste of just how
complicated and how deadly the situation is.
Two teenagers have been arrested in connection with the shooting of a
student in Salford. Anuj Bidve, 23, was killed in the early hours of
yesterday. Anuj Bidve had only been in Britain
for three months before he was shot dead. The 23 year old Indian
postgraduate had started studying at Lancaster University, something
his family say was his dream. He had decided to stay in Manchester
for the Christmas break. He and some friends were on a night out
McDonald's. One of them spoke briefly to him before pulling out a
When I first arrived on the scene, I saw the guy, I knew he was in a
critical condition, but I did think he was going to survive. I was
holding his hands, his hands were very warm. He kept on trying to
breathe. It was really weird how he is not with us now. Tributes to him

he was very humble. He was a person who would never harm anyone. He

detectives. Greater Manchester Police say they
know there is still a great deal of anxiety about the murder in this
area. But that information from members of the community is of
great help to the investigation and this evening officers are
continuing to make inquiries door  to door.
