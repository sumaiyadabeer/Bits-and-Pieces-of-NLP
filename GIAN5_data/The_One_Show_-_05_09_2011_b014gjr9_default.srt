Hello and welcome to the The One Show with Matt Baker and Alex Jones.
We are going to be following David Walliams as he begins his 140 mile
swim along the Thames as part of the Big Splash initiative.
It has been a tough start, but if he makes it to the finish line,
well you will be the first to hear. Joining is one of Britain's best
loved actors who returned to our screens last night, it is Inspector
George Gently, Martin Shaw. You have got to admire David,
haven't you, taking on such a gruelling challenge? It is awesome,
140 miles? Yes, in eight days. He is doing, what's that a day?
is about 22 miles a day. It is quite a few laps of a
swimming pool put it that way. One woman who has been waving David
on from the river bank is Angela Rippon. Angela, is there any sign
waters of the Thames at 8am this morning at Lechlade. If everything
goes well a week from today he will have finish the 140 mile marathon
swim and be ending up at Westminster Bridge, but let's look
at the latest pictures that we have got of him. These were taken
earlier today and I have to tell you it looks as if he is swimming
really strongly. A great technique, but we know he is at least an hour
behind schedule. He is in trouble. He is having difficulties on his
first day. I will tell you more about that later. Look at the
reception committee, he does love to make an entrance!
They will be spurring him on, those Morris dancers.
Let's hope he makes it. Has raised �71,000.
We know you are a technology fob... Fob... Who told you that? Can you
have a stab at telling us what an app is? Those nice people called my
children tell me I shouldn't bother with it because I wouldn't
understand. A good effort.
I have seen the apps my kids have on their phone. They look wonderful.
My phone doesn't accept them. are computer programmes on your
mobile phones that allow you to do things like play games, orderer
your groceries. Some claim to monitor everything
from high blood pressure to 13 million of us have got one of
these, a smartphone, music, movies and television, an app for
everything and the latest are designed to keep our health in
check, but are they good enough to keep the doctor from the door?
As our lives get busier and busier, we seem to have less and less time
to do the things that keep us well like exercise and take regular
health checks, health apps offer instant readings for just about
everything from blood pressure to detecting cancerous moles, but how
effective are they and are they really safe? We decided to stage
our own road test of the three of the most reviewed health apps, a
blood pressure monitor, a blood alcohol monitor and and an app to
test for cancerous moles. We took took a GP and tested Howard's blood
pressure with standard equipment and the new blood pressure app. Are
you nice and relaxed? Yes. As much as I can be in your presence.
140 over 99. How is that? Probably a bit on the high side.
In both tests Howard registered a similar elevated reading. Stuck in
the back of the cab with two young ladies could be stressful!
What's your verdict? For usage at home and getting an idea of what
your blood pressure is doing over a period of time, it is not a bad
idea and it is straightforward to use.
The app is free, but the blood pressure cuff that goes with it
costs under �200. The manufacturers advice users to consult a doctor if
they have they have concerns about blood pressure.
After a day at work, there is nothing nicer than a drink to help
you relax, but doctors are always telling us to limit the amount we
consume. How about an app app that plays the part of the cautionary
voice telling you how much alcohol there is in your blood stream. You
can download the blood alcohol content reader for free. It uses a
simple questionnaire to calculate your blood alcohol levels as
opposed to a chemically based police standard standard breath
test. The number of drinks you have consumed? Two two shots of vodka.
Two glasses of rose. Hours spent drinking? Two hours.
It is saying find a taxi. Oh right. I wouldn't be comfortable with
driving. I am going to breathalyze you. Keep
going and stop. OK. Let's see just how drunk you
are. 83. You are well over the limit. The legal limit for a breath
test is 35 micro grams. People would use this in the wrong
way and use it as a guidance as to whether they should drink and drive.
It has a disclaimer, I think it might get misused.
We contacted the developer and they said it is for entertainment
purposes only. It is one thing to use technology as a way to monitor
your drinking, but some medical professionals are growing concerned
about apps that offer self diagnosis like SpotMole, a product
that claims to detect cancerous melanoma. Let's see because this we
know is a harmless mole and let's see what it says about a known
harmless mole. We try the app seven times and only once did it give the
correct diagnosis as being harmless. The rest stated the mole as
problematic. This is per perting to make a
diagnosis. The dangerous form of skin cancer called the melanoma can
be fatal if it is not diagnosed early enough and it would be tragic
if someone relied on a programme like this for something that is a
potentially fatal condition. Health professionals think some of
the apps can be useful, but they express concern about those
involving self diagnosis because playing at doctors and nurses can
do us more harm than good. The company behind the Blood
Alcohol Content Calculator claims their app encourage responsible
driving by giving numbers for local taxi drivers.
Dr Mark Porter is here. Dr Mark, do you think there is a place for
these apps? They are simply computer programmes. Just because
they are on your mobile doesn't make them magic. The blood pressure
app, the machine I use every day a proper NHS machine is half the
price of that app. Why would you buy it other than to be a gadget?
This is my phone. I was looking at the apps and I have got something
for testing colour blindness. You have a body mass app. The most
useful app is a first aid app. I have St John Ambulance's if someone
is choking, you press choking and it takes you through dig grams of
what to do, including telling you to to dial 999. I would urge
everybody, if you can have one medical app, it is what to do in a
crisis. The number of compressions? Tells
you what to do. We were talking about you
collapsing on stage last year, I don't suppose an app helped you
then? I was ill over the weekend. I had a bad chest infection, but we
have got this thing in the entertainment industry, you don't
stop. I know it is crazy, but I drove, we were on the tour at the
the time. I drove to the tour venue. Felt lousy, did the show, did the
next one and my cue came and I collapsed.
It was a slow and dignified bend forward and my son was in the wings
and he brought the curtain down as it happened.
Thank you. When David Walliams was on the show
last week, we spoke about the wildlife he might see along the
Thames. It sounds like he has too much on his mind to take it in.
Jamie Crawford is devoting time to help you take better snaps.
I am in the north Downs in Surrey on a mission to photograph one of
the most acrobatic animals in the UK, the grey squirrel. It is
thought these flexible rodents can jump ten times their own body
length, about three meters. It is that amazing leaping ability that I
want to photograph. Oh, missed it! Technically, I have got a
photograph of a leaping squirrel. Is it any good? No, it is rubbish!
That greyish brown blur is a squirrel, I promise!
Jamie, hello. Kim Taylor has has taken truly
breath taking wildlife shots. He has devised a very clever way to
steer squirrels in my direction. A feeding station with only one route
on to it. So So actually this is an ingenious design, they can climb up
the pole, but can't reach the food. You have a prickly pile, therefore
the only route is a mid air jump. From the launch to the glide, to
the touch down, I want a shot that reflects the squirrel's jumping
ability. Kim's system can capture three images of the squirrel's jump
in one photo, but to achieve it takes a lot of ingenuity.
The camera shutter is is going to be open for the full time of the
squirrel's jump. There will be three flashes which will give you
three images of the of the squirrel. The flashes are triggered by the
camera shutter opening, but because the squirrels are fast, my
reactions won't be quick enough. Naturally Kim has thought of that,
a squirrel launchpad. The the weight of the squirrel is
not enough to trigger it. When the squirrel jumps it kicks off and
triggers it. I just need to wait and prime the
camera when I see a squirrel on the pad, but will it work?
Squirrels are most active at first light and I've let Kim stay in bed
rather bravely. When it comes to doing it I'm terrified.
I have seen my first squirrel. He is teasing me. He is not going near
the jump. Although the hide has been here for weeks, they know
something is up. Plenty of activity, but not just the kind I need.
Finally they start building up I wonder if they would be jumping
in I wasn't here? My my only hope is they can't resist the smell of
Wow. It works and it looks amazing. Now the confidence amongst the
I can't sit round here any longer. The first one is a classic jump.
The second one you can see using his tail to balance midair.
I have to say thank you so much for this, because it's your ingenious
flash system. It was you who pressed the button. There's too
much back patting going on here. Wow some shot that. You liked that,
dpbtdsnu I loved that. He was very chuffed with himself. We know
you're a big fan of wildlife. Is it a bear charity you're patron of?
it's not. Do you know why we say that? Because we found this picture.
Oh, my gosh. That was such fun. The bigger of the two bares was Daley.
He was about 6'3". We got to know each other so well, he would take a
polo mints from my lips, with this enormous gob coming at you.
have to have a huge amount of respect for animals like that.
had a huge amount of respect for the trainer and he told us how to
behave around the bear. Had ewas a very gentle soul. It's still a wild
bear. Lars Halvor Jensen came back to the screens last night   
Inspector George Gently came back to our screens last night. Lots of
detective daum yaz on screen at the moment. What makes Gently so like
likeable? If I knew, I would be a rich and successful producer. I'm
just grateful they do like it. We have an award winning writer. We
have the beautiful city of Durham, your home down. Yes! That really
adds a tremendous amount to the programme. To me, in particular,
you have got this wonderful cathedral looking down over
everything. It's a presence that's always there for you. There's a
lovely moment in the second film where you say, this is slowly
becoming my favourite view, as you're stood on the steps.
totally understand that. We get hardly any time off when we're
filming. We do two one and a half hour movies in eight weeks. Those
times I did have off I head for the cathedral. There's something
extraordinary about a place known 900 years of continuous worship.
It's interesting that it's shot there. The books were written in
Norfolk. I could have walked to work. That would have been quite
nice! I can see why they cholz Durham. It's, forgive me East
Anglia, it's a more interesting landscape. You know all the right
things to say when you're sat next to Matt. The films are set in the
1960s. We talked about you being a bit of a technophobe. Here you are
with your side kick, grappling with another new innovation.
Look at this, tea, milk, no sugar. Tea, sugar, no milk. Tea, no milk,
What's it taste like? Warm water, cold milk, no tea.
I have to disagree, those machines are the best 15p you can spend.
Interesting your relationship with Sergeant Bacchus has developed into
a father/son. Absolutely. It started almost instantly. He's not
only a very, very good actor. He's the nicest person you can work with.
He's very funny and mischievious. Did you take inspiration from any
other kind of df detectives? Because we've created what we think
is the ultimate detective. You have to guess who this is made up from.
If you can get four, I'll be amazed. Top down. Miss Marple. Then John
Thaw. Doing well. I can see my old mate David Suchet in there as
Poirot. What about the chin or nose? If you get the nose I'll be
amazed. It's not a male, that nose is not male. It's female. OK.
have to rush you. Shall we reveal all. Go on.
Helen Mirren and luether of course. The next episode is on Sunday night,
looking forward to that. Next film I should say actually. You're in
pretty good shape, what are you a 34 waste? No, actually 32! I feel
terrible now. Now that's back fired! You came out earlier and
said "I think he's a 36". Only kidding. It makes buying jeans very
easy, 32, 32. I'm the same. On we go. It seems men are telling
porkies about expanding bellies and some shops haven't helped by
labelling trousers, can you believe, this a size smaller than they
actually are. We decided to arm Gyles Brandreth with tracky bottoms
and a tape measure. In Britain we're all getting bigger. It's
official. Even the statues are putting on weight. We fool
ourselves that we're slimmer than we actually are.
What size is your waste? 34 I think. If I'm being generous, 37.5 Sir.
You would be pleased if in the shop you saw 34.
Why say you're a 38, I can get into a 36. Even though it's crushing you
to death. What am I measuring? on with it.
Shop woz say they're trying to make people feel more comfortable about
themselves. No, they're trying to sell stuff. The point is you would
like to see 34. Do you think it's pandering to the vanity of people?
He's very vain, aren't you? No! the old Dales I looked up to men
because they were men, they had a certain ah... Manlyness. What I do
is wear elastic waist band, that's the trick. I loved that. That's
great. More measuring on The One Show. Gyles Brandreth 34 inch, if
you're wondering. We've heard of people changing their name. I've
always like Nelly myself. Have you? No. But it's not just people. One
village decided to change what it called itself as a thank you to
Egypt. Michael Douglas has the story and that is his real name, by
the way. This Hampshire village has two very
proud claims to fame. The first one is its name, which sounds more
Sahara desert than thatched cottage and the second is the story behind
the name. Enham Alamein was created aiz a unique home for war heroes
over 90 years ago. In the First World War, two million
British servicemen were injured. Three quarters of a million were
permanently disabled. Many, mentally and physically
traumatised, were brautd to Enham to help them recover. Small
military pensions meant they couldn't look after themselves.
They were given homes and their children grew up here.
Doug was born in Enham. His father Walter came here in 1919, suffering
from shell shock. Walter and his wife and children were only the
second family to move in. Doug is the one in white.
What was it like growing up here? It was different, because it was
only the latter years you realised how different it was. You were so
used to men walking about with one arm, one leg, nearly everybody had
a walking stick. You just thought that was the thing until you got a
bit older. Enham gave work to all of them. Walter became a cobler and
they provided a home to his family. A lot of men would have been on the
scrap heap, if it hadn't been for a like like Enham. My dad, it made
his life. The village was just called Enham in those days. Then
came the Second World War and the crucial battle of Alamein in Egypt,
when the alies repelled Rommel's forces. Hundreds more disabled
soldiers were brought here. As a gesture of thanks for Britain's
role Egypt raised more than �200,000 as a gift. And this is how
the village responded. With their new name, Enham Alamein
thrived. Today it's still going strongly. What's it like round here,
it strikes me as a very friendly place, is that right? Yes, it is.
There are lovely people here, very young, community minded. I'm told
there's something rather amusing back here. Wow! A barber's shop. My
spiritual home. How are you doing? Fine, thanks. For what it's worth,
you're doing an excellent job. kind of you. Thank you very much.
In peacetime, the demand from ex  servicemen diminished, so Enham
headquarters opened its doors to civilians. It's become one of
Britain's leading disability charities, helping 3,000 people a
year with learning, physical or mental disabilities. Brilliant. It
feels like part of the village here. It doesn't feel like an instuegs at
all. There's a philosophy, that you are the boss, you're an individual.
Can you achieve whatever you wants.    want.
So what's Enham brought to you here? Fplgts it's brought whole new
life for me and opened up a new load of doors and opportunities for
me. Enham has always provided employment to give disabled
servicemen a new start. Today, it's as busy as ever. Here they're
packing up products for well known companies. We look at cape yablgts,
not the disabilities, that's how I like to put it. We give everybody
encouragement, a purpose and value here. What do you feel that working
here has brought you? Confidence, self esteem, despite my disability.
It's given me a good looking life It's given me a good looking life
now. In the early days horticulture was one of the favourite jobs. For
the men who came here from the horrors of war, the tranquillity
must have been like paradise. As productive now as ever, veg and
flowers are growing right through the year. It's very good therapy.
You get everything from seed to plate. Everyone benefits enormously
from the therapeutic side of things. Can I take some home with me?
you can indeed. 25,000    250,000 people have come to find help here
over the years. The charity has been helping the services again
recently, servicemen from Afghanistan and Iraq to get jobs on
civvy street. Enham Alamein, now if that isn't a name to    with a
claim to fame, I'll eat my hair brush. Nice to see Michael without
the clippers for a change. He did mention them twice. Time now to
return to the Thames to see how David Walliams is doing. Angela,
any sign of him yet? Absolutely no sign at all, I'm afraid, so far. In
fact, where you've joined me is at Bablock Hythe in Oxfordshire. This
is where David is hoping to come ashore at the end of his first day
of this eight day marathon, which started at 8am, when he slipped
into the icy cold waters of the Thames at Lechlade.
Feeling quite nervous, because it's very cold this morning. We were
hoping that the temperature was going to be 20 degrees in the water.
But it's 15. It's nice though, loads of people have come out to
see me this morning, which is fantastic.
I got that thing where I really
want to get started now. I feel like, come on let's get on with it.
I keep on saying I'm going to do it, but I haven't done it yet. Ahead of
him he's got 140 miles swimming for an average of eight hours a day for
eight days. But only 15 minutes in and David had to negotiate the
first of 46 locks. Then it was straight back in the water and it's
You saw there that David went into the water in his swimming trunks. I
can tell you he hadn't been in the water very long when he hit trouble.
Look at the latest film. He looks as if he's swimming really strongly,
but now he's in a wetsuit. His trainer, who was swim ago longside
him in the film noticed that he was going blue around the neck. That
was an indication that he was beginning to suffer from
hypothermia. Now that is really very serious this early in his swim.
Instead of being able to complete the 21 miles today, which is what
he was hoping for, what I can tell everybody here now, because I've
just heard, he's actually only made 17 miles. He's at Northmoor lock
and they're taking him out of the water because he is beginning to
struggle and they don't want him to get into any more difficulties. But
you will be able to see him.
for you. We can't start the party without you. Incredible. I think
it's important to note, that it doesn't matter how long it takes
him to do. He has to keep going. Thank you very much. We catch up
with David on the next leg of his swim tomorrow. Don't be tempted to
jump into the Thames because of course it is dangerous. If you have
