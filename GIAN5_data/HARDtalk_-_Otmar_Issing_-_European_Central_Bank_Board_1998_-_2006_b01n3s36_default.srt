called upon Hugo Chavez to remedy a long list of broken promises.
Now it is time for HARDtalk. European leaders fear they could
damage the currency, and Europe itself. My guest helped bring the
euro to life. Back then, Otmar Issing believed political union was
essential. Now he fears that greater centralisation of powers in
Brussels will cause a public backlash that will wreck not just
the currency, but the continent as well.
Otmar Issing, welcome to HARDtalk. When you were first nominated for a
position on the board of the newly  created European Central Thank you
appeared before the European Parliament and at the time you said
"I don't think I'm under any illusion as to how difficult this
job will be". What made it so? There is an anecdote which is true.
A former president of the Bundesbank once came to the office.
I was a member of the Board of the Bundesbank. He suggested that I
should be the German candidate for the first executive board of the
ECB. He tried to convince the Chancellor. One day he came back to
me and he said that the idea had been rejected. He was asked if I
ever said anything friendly about the euro. I asked him   what did
you say? He said "probably not". I was not sceptical, but I was aware
of all the problems. Problems which stem from the fact that the 11
countries which would form the first group of the Union were
anything but a homogenous group. Economic theorists have developed
the idea of an optimal currency and that countries have to fulfil
certain criteria or   that they are fit for the union. This certainly
did not apply for these 11 countries. On top of that, from the
beginning, or even before there was a weak spot which was fiscal policy.
The Germans had insisted on introducing the stability and
growth bank to have a European control on public finance in
national sovereign states. But in a publication from the Institute of
economic Affairs, I said that was putting the cart before the horse.
Having this stability and Growth Pact implies that you have a jury
consisting of politicians, finance ministers   a jury consisting of
potential sinners judging actual sinners. Can this work? And the
question was answered very early on, because it was in fact Germany and
France that breached the growth and stability pact themselves. Let me
put something to you that Henning Christiansen, one of the European
Commissioners, said to me. He said it was the then prime ministers of
Germany and France who took the decision to suspend the stability
pact. He said that that was, in his view, a major disaster. Was that
where it started to go wrong? started going wrong before and in
different fields. Also in fiscal policies, because monitoring,
surveillance by the commission, it was too lax. What is mostly
forgotten is that the main message of the stability and Growth Pact
was not that the country should not exceed the 3% deficit limit, the
main message was that a country, in normal times, economic normal times,
should have a balanced budget. If it has high debt, it should have a
surplus. That is so that in times of economic weakness we had a long
way to go from 0 deficit all the way to 3%. This main message was
never dominating the discussion. The discussion was all about
dominating the    not violating the 3%. When France and Germany do that
in 2003, that was the fatal blow to this idea of European control of
fiscal policies of sovereign states. I was an economic and financial
committee representative on the European Central Bank   this is the
committee which prepared for the finance ministers. It was the
deputy finance ministers Commission in the European Central Bank. As a
German, I was not the German representative of the ECB, but in
this moment, I felt, as a German, this was humiliating. Germany, the
country which had insisted on having such a pact, it violated it.
They organise their political majority against the application of
the rules and sanctions. This was also a bad signal and it gave the
impression that rules are for the small countries, the small members
of this club. The big guns to what they want to do. How did the
smaller members react when they saw the big guys effectively tearing up
the rule book? This was another disappointment. It was another
disappointment because I waited for the moment in which the rules would
not only be applied to the small ones, for example, we applied the
rules to Ireland because Ireland had a surplus which was behind to
their promise. I argued in favour of the rules, because we have to
demonstrate that the rules have to be strictly observed. I expected an
outcry by the small members. But this was very muted. The
explanation was that there was political pressure behind the
scenes, promises, all of that. this what was worrying you in the
early days when the preparations were being made for the euro? You
were only in place six months before the euro was launched.
Admittedly, the notes and coins didn't arrive until the beginning
of 2002, but even so, you were a new institution tried to draw up
new rules for something that had never existed before. In doing so,
it was based on information you receive from other countries. I
wonder what the quality of that information was? It was lousy. In
one word. This is not blaming anybody, because it was only three
weeks before we started with the executive board of the European
Central Bank in June 1998. It was then that this union was created.
So, statistics were not prepared for ten years or so. Just take one
example, when I received a number on, let's say cars sold in the last
quarter, say, 5 million   this number doesn't tell you anything.
You must know what it should be normally. He need the comparison
with past data, etc. All this didn't exist. Data, for example, on
unemployment from Italy had a time lag of nine months. Others had six
months, three months. They were then aggregated to one figure. We
were really sailing through uncharted waters. This was a big
problem. In retrospect, the introduction of the euro in 1999
went without any turmoil in the markets. If you would come from
Mars and look at monetary statistics from December 1998
through to January 1999, you wouldn't see any impact. This is
incredible. I was aware of the challenge because people were very
suspicious about losing the Deutschmark and having a new
currency. Having an experienced more board in front for it in
exchange for a well respected Deutsche a Bundesbank. I was well
aware of all that. I was working on confidence and credibility. It was
a major challenge and this task was much better solved than anybody
could have expected. But Salford, for what you are saying, on the
basis of inadequate and incomplete data    solved. Maybe even
falsified data? You're probably referring to Greece. Greece came to
matter years later. But talking about them   we had to take the
data which came from them. Of course, the data for Greece on
public deficit and the deficit in the public expenditure, the decline
came surprisingly fast. This raises some suspicion. If you had that
suspicion, would you under the obligation to challenge it?    were
you not. If we asked, and they would have said "that is not your
responsibility". You could have played euros that, couldn't you?
You could have told them to interrogate Greece. They were
asking you to make some very important decisions on the basis of
data, that you were very unhappy and uncertain about, even if you
couldn't pin down what was actually wrong with it. But this is from
hindsight. From hindsight. Nobody at the ECB was asking these
questions? They were looking at the data and saying "hopefully this is
true". Building a new currency on "hopefully"? The other currency was
already established. There was some creative accounting in almost all
countries. Well, let's move on to what's happening now. I suppose the
most pressing question right now is whether to grant Greece more time
to meet the terms of the bailout. What is your view? My view very
early was that one should make a clear case   if the country doesn't
deliver on commitments, one should not continue to give financial aid.
The argument against that was always contagion. If Greece would
leave, speculators would then attacked other countries   we will
not mention names. This is a relevant risk, but there is another
kind of contagion, which is the following   if a country gets one
rebate after another on commitments, then the pressure for other
countries to comply with commitments is declining. I think
we have seen that makes difficulties for governments like
in Portugal, making difficulties for them to stick to commitment and
reforms in the way that when he did over the past decades. The crisis
has brought it to the limelight all the deficiencies and structural
problems in different countries. But at the same time, the crisis
has also worked as a catalyst. is the point of making Greece leave
the eurozone, in effect, when the rules have already been broken?
It's already been bailed out twice. Isn't it better, in Germany's
interest as well, that Greece remains. It's an export market,
it's part of the dream of Europe, the European ideal. This is
certainly relevant and it is an economic argument. And, as the
identity of what is called Europe. This is an aspect that has to be
reflected. At the same time, the question is   what kind of union
should survive? I once said that this is a kind of club. If you are
a club of non smokers and a member of the club continues to smoke or
starts smoking after entry, what do you do? You have two alternatives.
Either you change the rules and the club becomes a club of free will
for everybody, or those who want to The Greeks will say that Germany
has an historical field of Haifa inflation back from the 1920s.   
hyper inflation. The damage it did to Germany. But there is another
lesson that Germany are not learning and that is what happened
after the First World War. Germany paid reparations. Even when its
economy could not face it because France said it must be punished and
it has to learn the lesson. That is the lesson they via the Greeks are
being getting. This comparison is a very bad sign. The idea was that
Europe would bring us closer to political union but increased
identification of people with Europe. I always thought the Soviet
to be wrong. Something OP has said he is happening. We had the
illusion, and the hope that memories of the past of the Nazi
regime, after more than 50 years since the end of the Second World
War are something for the history books. This is coming up again and
these bad feelings,... This is a sign for me that with the
introduction of the euro, a single currency for all members, we have
come very far to what is accepted by the people and for me, this is
an indication that we need for more Europe, that very cry, is a
conclusion which we have gone too far. You have mentioned that Angela
Merkel told about the need for a better Europe. We have had some
solutions proposed. The European Central Bank is providing the
mechanisms that will allow it to buy bonds. Mario Draghi, the
President of the central bank, saying this is the way the markets
can be reassured that countries will be given breathing space to
make the reforms necessary to make the euro were it. The German
president in August described the actions as legally questionable. Do
you think it is acting beyond its powers? If it is illegal or not
will be decided by the European Court of Justice. Leave that aside.
For me, these expanse the mandate of the ECB be on what it should do.
The ECB you said well start to buy bonds   they are ready 200 billion
in its balance and 60 million off covered bombs. So this is something
which has already happened. Now it is potentially unlimited.    thongs.
I understand why the notion is there is no limit because otherwise
it would be testing the market. Signalling it needed a limited    a
limited that mack of this is something very dangerous. The ECB
is doing the business which is not done by governments. The treaty on
which the multi  union his face is a simple principle   this is a
union of sovereign states and sovereign states in the end are
responsible for their policies, good and bad. Financial aid is
given, or solidarity is shown in case of for example an earthquake,
but these are not problems which are due to shocks, they are due to
mistakes of governments in the past. So it governments, European
governments together, they decide on a no bailout, then it is their
business and not the central bank. It those countries like Italy or
Spain or Greece were to leave the eurozone, would Germany suffer more
than it would gain. It may not see the transfer of resources to prop
them up but it may lose export markets? Unit to distinguish
between the short term and the medium to long term. I'm not
arguing that Germany should reintroduce a national currency.
This would be a foolish idea. Very dangerous and absorb. Germany
should not leave the eurozone? absolutely sure Germany will never
leave the eurozone for political and economic reasons. You said, I
belong to a group that argues Europe should been preceded by
political union. Are they coming to terms with the need for that. There
is now much talk for a move towards what they describe his genuine
political and monetary union? are talking about two different
animals. The political reunion I referred to, which was by the way
mention by the Chancellor in 1991 when he presented to the treaty to
the back, he said it would be a sort to have a political malty
Union without political union. This idea was based arm for a common
government and parliament. What the top is now, it is on correcting
political union is so far away from being an mechanism for repairing
programmes    problems that I do not see any a readiness in
countries to treat you changed to take a risk of referendum etc. I do
not see the people are yearning for political union. What is discussed
now is for me a kind of fancy idea. It is the kind of idea, to bring it
to the point, we promise to go in the direction of malty Union in
exchange for that, we neutralise that. Money now and the promise of
political union later. This is a dangerous idea. I think it is even
fatal for identification of the people of Europe and nations within
the euro. Not just for the single company but fatal for the European
Union? Take the example of if I were to introduce euro ones which
is a popular idea with politicians at the Commission and academics.
The consequence would be to have interest rates rise in Germany
because Germany would have to shoulder guarantees for much more
debt, market would punish that, rates would rise in Germany. This
would imply... And in other countries it would decline soaked
it require a transfer of money from Germany to other countries without
any democratic litigation. This is a violation of the principle of no
taxation without representation. You wish you had challenged the
politicians more forcefully when the euro was being created? Years.
I think I realised very early that these Monetary prices did not
really work. One of the aspects... Mario Monti in a conference in
Brussels before he became Prime Minister said... He was polite and
said, we were too polite to each other. He did not suggest we should
shout at one another but, you see, if you're in negotiations and the
new government is elected, they come with promises and ideas and
then you give them money etc. To make things better. Then you see
