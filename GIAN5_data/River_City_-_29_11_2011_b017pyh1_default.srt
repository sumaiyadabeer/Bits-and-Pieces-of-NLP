Nice to see Jimmy playing the grandad,
seeing as the boy's no' related to him.
Jimmy's the only grandad Callum has.
  If you don't want to tell my about your ma...
  The last time we spoke was Easter.
It was a pure nightmare.
  I knew from the first minute, and you kept lying!
  What did you expect?
  The truth?
  You don't deserve the truth.
  I'm his grandfather.
Hi, Mum?
It's me...Stella.
We got family
We got family
So when I call you up Get y'all in
We got family
We got family
So when I call you up Get y'all in
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahhh ahh ahh ahh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahhh ahh ahh ahh
We got family
We got family
So when I call you up Get y'all in
We got family
We got family
So when I call you up Get y'all in...
  Stella!
It's your phone, again.
I got rolls.
And look... I phoned and the rent's no' bad. They're looking for a couple to move in before Christmas.
The rolls are a bit squished.
Just leave it!
It's your ma. I thought you were meeting her today?
Aye, well, I changed my mind.
  Since when?
  Does it matter?
  Well... aye.
  I don't see the point.
  But...
I'm not asking for your approval, OK? So just leave it.
So, you're looking to move in together?
Aye.
How about we go and see the flat this afternoon?
  No, I'm working.
  When you've finished your shift.
  I'm busy.
  Doing what?
Redesigning the Olympic stadium(!) Does it matter what I'm doing?
  What's wrong with you?
  Me? You're the one giving me grief about everything.
Did I miss something?
This morning I woke up to a nice girlfriend.
Went out, came back and she's turned into a Rottweiler.
  What's wrong?
  Nothing.
  Are you no' at least excited about the flat?
We could be in by Christmas. I thought it's what you wanted.
So you're doing it just to please me?
Aye, and I'm doing a great job so far, amn't I? I thought we both wanted it?
I just don't think we should rush into anything, right?
No' if we've got any doubts.
  I'm going to work.
  Stella, wait!
Do you no' think we should talk about this?
  It's to do with her mum.
  You reckon?
  Stella's been keen to move in together, aye?
  Aye.
  Suddenly she's freaking out, when she's due to meet her maw?
  Mm hm.
Remember how you felt when you found out about Theresa?
You couldn't think straight till you'd sorted it out in your head.
How can she sort it out if she won't even meet her?
Ayah! Ba...! Aaargh! >
  Stop making such a fuss. It's just a wee bike.
  It hit me on the heid, Scarlett.
Best place for it. I hope you've no' dented it.
  What are you doing?
  Got Madonna's old bike down for Cal.
  But it's pink.
  That's what I said.
  The boy needs a bike.
  I'll leave youse to it.
Any hot tips?
  Well, as long as you keep it to yourself.
  I'm a doctor.
We're souls of discretion.
I got it off a mate that knows the trainer.
Romping Ramsden in the 1.30 at Lingfield.
Dead cert.
Here's me giving you the benefit of my insider knowledge and you're doubting me?
Dan, you'll never place a safer bet in your puff.
When's a good time to put up your Christmas decorations?
  Hurry up. I'm busy.
  I really think you should meet your ma.
You were up for it last week.
Why won't you even talk to me about it?
  Because there's nothing to talk about.
  But we're a couple.
We should share.
Look, she clearly needs to talk.
But I don't!
Jackie?
Bob Adams. I'm Stella's boyfriend.
Stella didn't come, then?
  I suppose I should've expected it.
  Can I help?
I don't know.
The thing is...
It's her gran.
She's very ill. Dying.
I didn't feel it was something I could tell her over the phone.
No, of course not.
And I wanted to see my daughter.
See that she was OK.
She's kinda busy. You know?
What's Stella told you about me?
  Not very much.
  She'll have told you I put her in care?
Aye, but she didn't tell me the reason why.
She's quite private about stuff, you know.
I was hoping she'd let me try to explain.
Put things right.
I did it to keep her safe.
I know she won't believe this, but back then...
she was better away from me.
I think it was quite a hard time for her.
I know Stella's had her problems.
When I've tried to speak to her in the past she's always been so angry at me.
But now,
with her gran being so sick...
Can you speak to her?
Tell her I'm sorry.
And that if she'll let me, I'll make it up to her.
I'll try.
Well, it's no' something you can keep a secret, is it?
Lenny Murdoch being wee Callum's grandfather!
So that's 4.30 pick up at the Fish And Finger.
Maclean. Uh huh, OK. Thank you. Bye!
I don't care who knows. I'm proud to be a grandad.
  Easy for you to say! You don't have to live next door to him.
  More's the pity.
You'd want to listen to Scarlett and Kelly Marie being at each other's throats all day?
Never mind the wee boy greeting and coughing half the night. You're well shot of it.
Callum's got a cough? Is he all right?
He's fine, he's fine. Ignore me.
Age has meant my hearing has become finely tuned to the sound of bellyaching.
I'm sorry, is it possible to be taken early?
The nurse'll be out in a moment.
Mrs Robertson, if you just take a seat...
Inoculation day for kids.
They can make some noise at this age.
I blame Raymond. He spoiled him.
That's what dads like to do.
  Could you take Eileen in next?
  Of course.
That's a big noise for a little boy.
You'll frighten the poor little elephant.
Look! He's hiding.
I think you're going to be a very good boy for me.
It's a miracle!
Do you want to just take him in?
You OK?
  I'll be fine.
  It's not going to be an easy day for you, is it?
Look, why don't I handle inoculations today?
It's good for me to keep busy.
Work...helps.
But thank you.
So that's it, you stay in?
Sometimes I play cards with Molly.
I cannae believe a lassie like you would be happy with that life.
  I've got a kid.
  Aye, and built in babysitters.
Tell you what,
why don't me and you go out for a drink tonight?
All right then, lunch.
Half a shandy at the Ship and a plate of fish and chips. Nothing scary about that.
I'm not scared. Just choosy.
All right, so I take that as a yes, then?
Can we cut the hostilities for a bit?
  I'm busy.
  Being hostile? I'd noticed.
Look, I want to keep working here, so I'm quite prepared to be civil.
Look...
Don't want make an enemy of me.
  Is that a threat?
  Hey, just give me a break. For Ewan's sake.
I'm trying my best here. I mean, whether you like it or not, we're related by blood now.
So why don't you try, I don't know, meet me halfway?
Molly says Callum's got a cough.
  Is it serious?
  It was just a tickle.
  She says he was coughing and greeting all night.
  Since when did you start listening to her?
  Since she started talking about my grandson.
How are you getting on living with your mum?
  What's Molly said?
  Just your maw's nipping your heid. No prizes for guessing about what about.
  None of your business.
  Just thought maybe it's a bit...
  cramped.
  We manage.
  What's that for?
  Ewan's flat. I thought you and Cal should have it.
  Can't afford it.
  Rent's not an issue. I'll help with the bills.
I don't want to be kept by Lenny Murdoch.
Look, I'm only doing what any grandparent would.
His father would want.
Will you forget our family history for a moment? Think about the boy.
C'mon, say you'll think about it.
OK. I'm just thinking about it, mind.
Good.
Don't cut off your nose just to spite your face,
because you know your maw's going to give you a hard time about it.
You met Jackie?
I'm sorry. But you wouldn't know about your gran if I hadn't.
You went behind my back!
So is my gran in the hospital then, aye?
Your ma says you needed to contact your gran's lawyers.
Right, so who is he? Have you got a number?
So how am I supposed to contact him, then, Bob?
Jackie said you had to phone her.
  She'd give you the details.
  Brilliant.
So what else did Jackie have to say for herself?
She was upset. About your gran. About you.
Maybe if Gran had looked after me instead of Jackie, things might have been different.
Why did she no'?
The two of them fell out
because my gran didn't approve of the guys that she hung about with.
Then she moved away and I never found out where.
Your ma gave me this for you.
Gonnae call her Jackie.
She doesn't deserve to be called a mother.
"Eleven today. Happy Birthday. Love, Mum."
"Happy Christmas 2009. Love, Mum."
  "Have a lovely..."
  All right, I get it.
It shows she was thinking about you.
Why don't you unwrap one?
Maybe you should go and see her.
I mean, just to hear about your gran.
I can't have her here. This is my place.
At the Oyster?
What about my ma's?
Would she be there an' aw?
Do you think that would help?
Why would you encourage a family like that? You never know who they'll be bringing in.
Shhh! Look, Bob's in love with her, so we're going to support him.
Aye, we did the same for Big Bob, and now we've got an asylum seeker and her lassie at my house!
  Do we never learn?
  Maybe not.
Now if I remember rightly, it was you encouraged them to stay.
Oh, hiya, darlin'!
This is dead good of you, Scarlett.
Don't be daft! Nervous about seeing your ma?
The only reason she wants to see me is cos of my gran.
I'm sure that's not the case.
She hates me. I know she does.
How can she hate you? She's your ma!
Oh! Relax.
Hello, I'm Scarlett. I'm Robert's mother.
This is Molly, my ma. And this...
You know.
Stella.
So grown up.
We were sorry to hear about Stella's gran.
Why did you no' tell me over the phone?
I thought it would be easier face to face.
Besides, I wanted to see you.
Aye, so you did(!)
  Stella's done well for herself.
  She's Assistant Manager at the cafe.
  Manager?
It's funny to think, when you first knew her she was a wee alkie sleeping on the streets.
Well, she was!
Stella, I know things haven't been easy for you.
You must think I'm a terrible mother.
None of us here can cast the first stone.
There were reasons...
I thought they were good reasons, right? Why I let other folk look after Stella.
What, you mean put me in care, aye?
Right...
Molly, let's leave they two.
Gran!
Bob, will you stay?
  I thought you wanted us to look all happy families.
  Happy, no dysfunctional!
I thought you'd get a nice family.
  You were wrong. I didnae.
  At the time I thought I was doing the best for you.
What? Handing me over to strangers? That was what was best, was it?
I was a mess myself. I couldn't give you what you needed.
  I needed a mum.
  I had problems...
Yep, and they were all men, weren't they?
I just cramped your style.
  Stella!
  Whit?
  You're right to be angry.
I got it wrong.
I know I got it wrong.
Molly!
For goodness' sake, gie the woman a break!
So, what's she done that's so awful?
So she put you in care, Stella.
Let me tell you, sometimes it's the lesser of many evils in hard times.
  Well, you should know.
  We weren't in touch for years.
And look what a happy family we are now.
  Aye, look at us!
  Come on, Stella.
Be honest, sometimes you're too hard on folk.
Your gran gave me a second chance. If only for her sake, can't you do the same for me?
All I want is for us to go and see your gran. Together.
It's what she prays for.
You know what?
If this is so hard for you, I'll go.
No.
You're here now. Stay.
Files for the next patient.
Is Tatiana coping OK?
Yeah.
It's only been a few weeks. Keep an eye on her, eh?
Let me bring you a coffee before your next patient. He's running late.
I'll be back in a second.
Hello!
Lingfield.
Yeah. The card number is 2 3 2...
I'll get back to you, thanks.
There you go, Mr Lindsay.
Where's Kelly Marie?
  She said she had to take the wee man to the surgery.
  Callum?
  Aye.
Well, I don't think it was anything...
Sorry I couldn't get here any sooner.
Stella's meeting her ma at our house.
I know. It's nice when families make an effort to get on.
What's happening?
What's the matter with him?
  What's he doing here?
  It's that cough, isn't it?
We're just here the flu jab.
  That's all.
  He hasn't got a cough.
  You know, neither the two of you need to be here.
  Think I'm going to leave you here with him?
  What's that thing?
  Madonna's old bike.
  He loves it.
  Yeah, why you don't put a tiara on him and a pink frock and be done with it(?)
  Aye, well, there's worse things.
  Oh, you think?
Ma, will you stop fussing?
He's fine.
I was thinking,
maybe after Christmas we could all go on a wee family holiday.
Would you like that, Cal, darlin'?
  A wee trip to the seaside.
  Ma, in January?
Alton Towers. We could go there.
Don't promise him something we can't do!
When I promise this wee guy something, I'll do it!
Thought any more about my offer? You can't be living in a cramped flat sharing a room with the wee fella.
What's this?
  I offered her Ewan's flat.
  Don't you dare, Kelly Marie!
You know what? I can handle this on my own.
Tell you what, just let me know how he gets on, eh?
  Are you next?
  Yes.
Have you heard from Bob?
Whit? You've got a brass neck asking me that.
I telt you   stay away from my brother. You've done enough damage.
Kelly Marie? Would you like to come through?
I'll deal with this one, Tatiana.
  Can you make sure she's OK? I'll deal with the inoculations for half an hour.
Course, she'd been having symptoms for a while.
Never did a thing about it.
Embarrassed, I suppose.
When she got the diagnosis, she got in touch with me.
I've been looking after her ever since.
You don't believe me, do you?
Can you blame me?
You didn't look after me, so how can you look after her?
I know me and your gran have had our problems.
But we got through them.
I was hoping we could do the same.
I want to see her.
On my own.
Before you do, there's a few things you should know.
Here. It's your gran's lawyer.
He's seeing to everything at the minute. He knows what she wants.
You'd be better speaking to him about arrangements.
I'm sure he'll see you straight away.
I'm sorry I've not been the mother you wanted me to be.
I'm sorry we couldn't be friends.
  What time is it?
  Twenty to one.
Can you hold my next patient?
  They've cancelled.
  Great!
Where's Tatiana off to?
I sent her home.
She was in a state. Leyla said you had to take over the inoculations. I thought it was best.
  I'm free for the next half hour or so, right?
  Mm hm.
How about we go and have a quiet chat, eh?
Your gran wants you to remember her the way she used to be.
  Not sick and dying.
  But I need to see her!
Look, if Stella was to go with Jackie, would she see her?
I don't know. Possibly.
There's a few things we need to sort out first.
Your gran instructed me
to give you this.
My gran's ring.
She used to let me play with it when I was wee.
It used to glitter in the light.
She wanted it to be passed from mother to daughter.
Right, so why has Jackie not got it, then?
It's important to your gran for you and your mother to reconcile.
She wants you to give the ring to your mother,
as a gesture of goodwill.
Did your mother tell you
that you'll be the sole beneficiary when your gran dies? She's leaving everything to you.
I wouldn't have thought there'd be much to leave. Not that it matters, but...
Well, at the moment it's standing at about £11,000.
Listen, Jackie said that she was looking after her.
But that's not true, is it? Because she can hardly look after herself.
Your mother has done all she possibly could since your gran got the diagnosis.
She was devastated when your gran couldn't get the treatment she needs.
They couldn't get the treatment for her?
Unfortunately, the drug that could reduce the tumour is deemed to be too expensive on the NHS.
So she just doesn't get it?
Not unless she pays privately.
But this drug could save her life?
  It could do.
  Why not use the money she was going to leave me?
Your mother and grandmother agreed not to touch that.
There must be something I can do.
The only one who could is your mother.
She has power of attorney.
But she supports your grandmother's wish for you to have the money.
Well, can I no' just sign that over?
That's for you to discuss with your mother.
But it is possible?
Me having this. It... doesn't bother you?
You're so kind.
I don't deserve anyone's sympathy.
That's why I lost my baby, isn't it?
It's punishment for how I've behaved.
You're too intelligent a woman to believe that.
I've made such a mess of things.
I deserve this pain. You don't know what it's like to feel that...
you've ruined the best thing you've ever had.
  I think I do.
  If you're saying that just to make me feel better...
  I have a wife and a child.
And right now, they feel pretty well lost to me.
You've never mentioned it before.
It's still pretty raw.
What happened?
She thought I loved that more than them.
And did you?
For a while it seemed like the easier option.
You want them back?
More than anything.
First I have to prove that...
..that I can beat my demons.
I don't want any more of this.
You have to forgive yourself, Tatiana.
And let yourself grieve.
  You're too busy getting on with things. You're not giving yourself a chance.
  Stop being kind to me.
No.
I want to help.
There's somewhere...
There's somewhere I need to go.
Do you want company?
Yes.
It's good, isn't it?
To have a place like this.
Gravestones don't seem...
right.
This is the first time I've felt like coming here.
I hoped...
That Bob would come with you.
I'm sorry.
  Let it out.
  I'm so sorry.
Just let it out.
Here.
How're you feeling?
Look, your gran wants you to have that money.
Aye, but it could save her.
Or no'. There's no guarantees.
So you're saying I should just say, "Stuff my gran," let her die and then just take the money?
No!
I'm saying maybe you should talk it over with your ma.
Aye, well, I've been thinking.
Aye?
That maybe Molly was right.
Maybe I was a wee bit too hard on Jackie.
You think she's all right, don't you?
Aye.
I've thought the worst of her for so long,
it's hard getting my head round.
She thought she was doing the best for you.
It didn't feel like that.
Folk do things for different reasons.
Then why didn't she explain it to me?
Maybe she tried. Maybe you were too young.
Your ma and your gran made it up.
And your ma wants you to have that money.
I don't know.
I've had to stop myself believing I had a family.
I wanted it so much.
I look at you and your mum and your sister...
and I'm pure jealous.
You've got Jackie.
And your gran.
Right, I'm gonnae phone her.
She loves you, you know.
Mum?
It's me.
'Mine's A Pint seemed to stumble there.
'But up front, Juggler's Delight, Justin's Bugle
'and Romping Ramsden are side by side.'
Come on, Romping Ramsden! You can do this! Come on!
'As they approach the home stretch, it's Juggler's Delight, the favourite, Romping Ramsden...'
I thought you should know... Lenny's down at the creche with Callum.
  'And it's Romping Ramsden...'
  Go on, son!
'Juggler's Delight coming back at him. Romping Ramsden, Juggler's Delight...
  'Romping Ramsden, Juggler's Delight... Romping Ramsden just gets there!'
I've told you, I'm his grandad.
  I just want him to see his bike.
  You're not getting in.
If I was going to abduct the boy, would I be this obvious?
Where do they get people like you   out of lucky bags?
  What're you doing?
  Came to see how he was after his jag.
  If there was a problem, they'd let me know.
  These people?
  And what's with the bike?
  He can't run about on a lassie's trike!
  You should have spoken to me first.
  He needs a proper bike. Anyone with common sense knows.
You can't do this.
You can't keep muscling in. Callum's my responsibility.
  And I'm his grandad and I want what's best for him.
  And you think I don't?
  What do you want me to do?
You want me to bin it now?
The bike stays with you. My ma sees it, she'll go off her heid.
  I wouldn't want that.
  This is what it would be like,
if I moved in at the flat. You'd have your say on everything.
  Popping in all hours, checking up on us.
  No.
  I'm gonnae get Callum.
I could get him into a proper nursery, not this dump. I could get him private health care.
You think her maw could get her that? No chance!
Hey. Look what your grandad's got for you!
Wait, Callum, don't go on it just now. It's a bit big. You can play on it tomorrow.
All right? Good boy.
You need me, Kelly Marie.
Keep the change.
I just want to say...
thank you.
Let's make today a new start, eh?
For both of us.
Thanks, bye.
So this is where you live?
Bob too?
He's got his own place.
I didn't think you'd want to see me again.
Did you go to the lawyer?
Mm hm.
He told me about that drug.
That it might save gran's life.
Do you think it could?
Mum...
It's all right.
Tough day?
No. Not bad at all, as it turns out.
We did it! We did it, Dr D.
Romping Ramsden. On the nose.
Ya wee dancer!
  Please tell me you did put a bet on.
  Oh, Gabriel, Dan's a busy man, healing the sick.
We can't all be idling our time away betting on the horses.
Well, do you fancy idling your time and coming to help me celebrate?
C'mon, Liz, get your glad rags on and grab Malcolm. You coming?
Drinks are on me, and you are a cheap date. Come on, let's go.
We'll be right behind you.
That lawyer shouldn't have said anything about her treatment. Your gran didn't want you upset.
He thought I'd a right to know.
It's not the doctors' or the nurses' fault.
it's the bureaucrats who decide the budgets.
Look,
I went to a lawyer and he gave me this...
He told me that gran wanted to leave me the money.
I want her to have it. For her treatment.
Do you not want her to get better?
Of course I do! She's my mother.
OK, then take it. You're her...
  what is it again?
  Power of Attorney.
Aye, so the two of us sign this
and you can use the money to help gran.
But she wanted you to have the money.
This morning I didn't have any money.
And I didn't have any family.
I'd hand it to her 100 times.
There must be some way we can help Stella.
This really isn't necessary, Ma. Cal's fine.
Heaven forbid that Lenny Murdoch would cast aspirations.
It's aspersions! Move the stuff over there.
  We'll go clear my bedroom, then move your stuff.
  What's going on here?
  Mum's insisting on swapping bedrooms with me and Cal.
  Whit?
There must be a way Stella can keep her inheritance AND help her gran.
It's very important to keep family together.
I hope youse would pay to keep me alive.
I'm going to get Cal's snack.
We've got to do something. We could have a quiet word with the lawyer
and he can come up with some ideas. I'm phoning him.
Jimmy, don't be so childish!
Don't be so stupid! Kelly Marie's perfectly happy where she is! Why change?
Kelly Marie!
  What?
  When were you going to tell me?
An all expenses paid trip to Florida for you and Cal?
  I can't get through to him.
  < Lenny Murdoch's trying to buy you!
  What's going on?
  I don't know anything about those!
  I'm going to go and see him.
  Who?
  The lawyer.
< Fine! Take his fancy flat. Take his holidays. But you're no daughter of mine if you become a Murdoch.
Want a lift? Let's go, before she drags me into this.
Fancy running away from a good argument!
I'll tell him! Trying to buy his filthy way into this family.
Mum, wait!
  Gran, gonnae look after Cal for me?
  Oh, but...
I'm not happy about this.
It's for Gran.
At least she's brought us together.
You're a good girl.
  Right... Will we go and see Gran, then? Tell her the good news?
  Yes.
  We don't need to tell her we used that money. We could say we got a loan.
  Whatever you want.
Here.
Mum's ring? Where did you get this?
The lawyer gave me that an' aw.
He says that Gran wanted it to be passed from mum to daughter.
She wanted me to give you it.
I think it's supposed to be symbolic.
I'm sorry, love, you'll have to spell it out.
That we're all right.
Me and you.
Are we?
I missed you, Mum.
Think you can buy us off with a Florida trip?
Scarlett, darling, I wouldn't have you if you came with a free tank of petrol.
He's my grandson.
I'm allowed to buy him gifts.
  You cannae bribe him.
  I'm protecting him.
You let him out in the street with that pink trike thing, he's gonnae get leathered.
He cannae be riding that thing. It's too big for him.
You cannae stand that he's got a grandad that can get him stuff and his granny cannae.
  He'll get all he needs from his family.
  I'm his family.
  No' as far as I'm concerned.
  Right, OK, let's cool it.
Suck it up, doll. Because I'm here to stay.
Aye. And flashing the cash.
Is that what family means to you? Where's yours, then?
  A son who cannae get far enough away and a daughter who'd rather be in the jail.
  Watch...
  Enough!
  You have to stop interfering.
  I'm only thinking of you, darlin'.
No, you're not. You're certainly not thinking about Callum.
The pair of you are like kids, competing with each other.
  Not setting a good example for a wee boy.
  He's not capable of setting a good example!
  Let it go, Mum!
We all know you think Lenny's a murdering, manipulating lowlife.
But the truth is, he's Ewan's dad.
Too right I am.
If we don't let Callum get to know his grandad, he's going to end up resenting us.
Look at Stella and her mum. I don't want my own kid to resent me because I never gave him a choice.
He'll get all he needs from us.
You're making this a fight between us and Lenny. It should be about doing the right thing for Callum.
  I can give him more.
  Have you no' been listening to me?
  Enough of your grand gestures, and fancy flats!
  You can have our flat. Me and Jimmy'll move into Molly's.
D'you know what? I've a good mind to take Callum and head off into the sunset, so I have.
Leave the pair of you.
You can bicker about who behaved the worst about sending me and your grandchild away.
Is that what you want?
Is it?
So this is how it's gonnae be. Mum, you need to stop gobbing off,
and you, if you really want to be Callum's grandad, let's see you put in a bit of groundwork.
And I'm not talking about big fancy holidays or private education.
Let's kick off with you taking him to the swings or something.
We'll take it a day at a time.
If you want to be part of Callum's life, you'll abide by my rules.
You both will.
Won't be long. I'll get Iona and somebody to witness it and we'll hand it into the lawyer tomorrow.
Are you sure about this?
Of course I am.
I think it's this one here.
You sure this is the right place?
He did say it was a temporary office.
You're telling me!
He's no' a lawyer.
  Hey!
  Keep your hands off me!
PHONE RINGS Why don't you answer that, Bob?
It's Jackie.
"She signed. Come and get me."
You're at it, aren't you?
Right, that's me got it signed.
I'll take it to the lawyer's tomorrow?
What are you doing?
I found it in the fridge. I thought we should celebrate.
I don't drink, Ma.
I cannae.
Come on. Us getting together? You saving your gran?
I'm hardly doing that.
It's her own money.
Before when you drank, it was about forgetting stuff, wasn't it?
You don't have to do that any more.
It's all behind you now. I'm here and we're OK.
To the future.
Our future.
Wahey!
Did that horse come home to Daddy today or what!
Hey, Dan, grab yourself something.
  Annie, get Dan here a glass and fill it with some juice.
  No, really, I'm going to head off.
Aw, what's up, you in the cream puff because you never managed a wee flutter yourself?
  I'm sure Dan's neither up nor down about it.
  Actually I'm raging.
The next time someone's life threatening illness
comes between me and a hot tip I'll know which way to go.
  Listen, you enjoy your night.
  To Dan.
To Dan!
You and Bob, is it serious?
  Aye. He wants us to move in together.
  Don't you want to?
Aye. I think I do.
But I really want to have my own family.
I'd love to get married and have kids.
I think Bob wants that too. But...
  But?
  I want to do it right.
I want to my kids to have security.
A good home.
I mean, what if it all goes wrong with Bob?
What if he walks out on me?
  And don't say he won't.
  Because you've seen it happen with me?
Aye, well I'm just scared, I guess.
Back in a minute.
You in Montego Street?
No. I'm right here.
Your boyfriend's phone.
What's this? Did she make you drink?
No, we were just having a drink to celebrate.
What's wrong?
Do you want to tell her? Go on.
Tell me what?
I'm so sorry, Stella.
  Sorry about what? Is somebody gonnae tell me what's going on here?
  It was a scam.
They were after the money your had gran left to you. Jackie and that lawyer guy.
If he's a lawyer, I'm an astronaut.
They needed you to sign over the lot to Jackie.
So all that stuff about my gran?
She died a couple of months ago.
I'm sorry.
So you made it up?
Mum!
Stella!
That's right. Drink it all.
You wee lush.
All that crap about how you've changed.
You've not changed.
All you'd do is drink the money away.
It's all you're capable of.
Get out.
I mean it, Jackie. Get out.
  Are you all right?
  Aye, I'm brilliant.
  Did you sign it?
  Aye, I signed it.
But you've still got it?
  I think you've got something that belongs to Stella.
  She signed it over to me. Job done.
  You tricked her.
  Get off her!
  Not until she hands it over.
  No.
  Phone the polis.
  Leave her alone, Jimmy. It was his idea to take the money, wasn't it?
Man, let's get out of here.
Did he put you up to this?
  I never meant to hurt you.
  Then why do it?
The presents. You saved all those presents.
She bought the presents a couple of days ago.
All of them. From the same shop.
  You don't know that.
  We found the receipt.
What's so wrong with me, Mum?
How could you never love me?
Because you looked at me like you're looking at me now.
You judged me from the moment you opened your eyes.
You whine for attention and then you judge me.
Look at you.
You haven't changed. "I want to do the right thing.
"I want my kids to have a security.
"A good home." Where do you get off thinking life's that easy?
You wait.
You wait till you've a man and a wailing selfish wean
at your feet telling you what a rubbish job you're doing.
Then you won't be so judgmental.
  No wonder none of your foster families lasted.
  That's enough!
The papers.
No, she can have them.
  It'll never stand up, anyway. They'd call it fraud.
  No. I mean it.
She can have the money.
I told you, didn't I, Jackie?
This morning I had no money, and no family. Well, you know what?
I'm actually quite happy to end the day like that.
Because see if letting you have that money
means I'll never see you again, then you can have it.
I told you what that woman put me through and you still made me see her again?
  This is as much your fault as it is hers, so just leave me.
  Stella!
She gave you the ring, didn't she?
  Give it me.
  It was left to me.
  You think I'm really going to believe anything you tell me?
  Just go, Chris.
We could cause you a lot of trouble.
It's not worth anything, anyway.
It is to Stella.
So you've not seen Stella at all?
She's not been home.
Right, cheers.
Awright?
I was worried.
I should have listened to you this morning.
I should have minded my own business.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
Why did you need to interfere?
Why did you think that you knew what my ma was like better than I did?
I thought if you sorted things out with your ma then you might feel better about...everything.
About us.
Aye, nice one, Bob.
A mum's supposed to be the person that cares about you the most, isn't she?
Do you know how it feels to know she doesn't just no' care about you,
  she'd actually screw you over an' all?
  Forget about her.
  Aye. Cos it's that easy, isn't it(?)
She said I judged her.
I didnae.
I just wanted her to love me.
But I don't make people happy, so...
You make me happy.
And as far as making people happy,
I've been totally rubbish at that today, haven't I?
It's no' you that's the problem. It's her.
Jackie.
How could she not love me, Bob?
You got it back?
Your gran would have wanted you to have it.
I'm so scared, Bob.
I'm scared of being this horrible person that nobody can love.
And as long as I feel that way, I'm THIS close to necking that bottle till I'm dead.
I'm just scared of moving in together, and it not working.
We can forget about moving into a flat together. For now.
First, I could move into yours. Your place. You can have the control.
I love you, Stella.
Don't shut me out so I cannae prove that to you.
That was more difficult than giving up the money.
Oh, sorry, your card's been rejected.
There must be some mistake.
No worries. Hand the money in later.
  Safe and sound.
  Were you a good boy at the seaside?
Did Grandpa Lenny take you to the reptile house to meet his pals?
  Who does she think she is?
  Cal's gran?
  I'm his grandad. She better get it through her thick skull!
Just get that money in the bank today.
