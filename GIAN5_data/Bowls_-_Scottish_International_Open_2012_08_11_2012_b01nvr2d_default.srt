happened to Robert. It really isn't like him because he is normally so
well known for holding. With the forehand, you have the chance of a
little bit of extra weight. If he had caught the bowl, it would have
been brilliant. Swings and roundabouts. First four ends to
Robert Paxton and the next four to There is still room for a set. That
would not be a problem. Robert is playing for the jack to try and
get the jack onto the respot to the edge, follow it through,
punch the green bowl out. Here it this. It will only be one. He was
close. It was the wrong side. Had it gone to the other side you would

tournament. Against Simon Skelton, with a time out. He could have

Whether he will get back or not, I am not sure. He didn't make it.
Second end two Alex Marshall. We go to a third and deciding end.
I think that was maybe a wrong to give the match away, after being
so dominant at the short jack length. He has just decided he
felt is worth taking.    one. The come out and defended his title
really well. All credit to Alex Marshall for scrambling his way

has resurrected himself in this game. He has nominated to kill the

hit it. He is close. What a good needed half bowl, a good solid half

not easy for Alex Marshall. Does he try and take the ball? Bowl? He is
playing so well he could draw this Robert Paxton. What a wonderful
match. Robert Paxton goes through on the tie break. He is again in
the semi finals. You must have been worried when I
went to the tie break? I was. Alex came back really hard. He put me in
a lot of trouble. He deserve the tie break. You had to pull
something out of the bag. You almost did it. I knew if I could

Robert Paxton still in the competition. Alex Marshall is out.
Next up, Mervyn King against Paul so he will have to adjust for the
King because he is now looking in Paul Foster to block Mervyn King's
forehand. I don't think he has managed to block it. It has all
been down to the conversion shots is so hard to play. So many of
these missed, and that is another one. A good call by Paul Foster to
accurate. He has played that jack both these players in many ways.

has to. He should run into this to open it up and give himself some

unlike Mervyn King. Paul Foster is King. If he uses the back can draw,
he might fall away from it. Beforehand might open things up and
be a better shot, but it is difficult. Yes, controlled weight

chance now. Mervyn King has one to play. Paul Foster has two. He does
have the advantage. I think he will go for the respot cover. Anything
he has none left. He may as well take the time out and used it. A
quarter finalist in a last four years.    in the last four years.

Royal against Nicky Brett. They had to put their friendship aside as
they fought for a place in the semi finals. In a game of nip and

giving him two shots. Two shots, Nick Brett. With the score at 5 7
Mark Royal played a great first bowl in the 8th end. His opponent

He failed, which meant the set was tight. After trading single point
in the first two ends he played a wonderful draw to take two shots in
the third. The bias only comes into effect in the last 25% of its
trouble. There you go.    of its travel. Nicky Brett then started
piling on the pressure. Mark Royal was having to pull out some huge
shots to stay in the match. Very close to this. Well played, Mark
Royal. In the end Mark Royal left himself with too much to do,
leading four from the final end of the second set he was left with a
match, Nick Brett. He gave the match to his fellow countryman. A
very close match between close friends. Nicky Brett is through to
the semi finals. Next up, an incredibly tight match. They have
all been brilliant so far. Robert Chisholm against Darren Burnett.
