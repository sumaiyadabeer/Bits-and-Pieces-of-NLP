Good evening. Welcome to North West Tonight with Gordon Burns and
Ranvir Singh. Our top story: All charges dropped against this
Stepping Hill nurse but police now say they're investigating the cases
of up to 40 patients, including 7 who died there.
We'll be reporting live on that breaking news from outside the
police press conference. Residents are moved out of a
Warrington care home after serious concerns are raised about their
welfare. All these residents, they've turned 90 but they've got
to find somewhere else. It is unbelievable, just terrible.
Troops for teachers   the controversial plan for a school
with the new man who has put more comeback in the spotlight.
And join me to find out why the Government was so interested in his
First tonight, we bring you major developments in the Stepping Hill
Hospital poisoning case. Rebecca Leighton, the nurse charged in
been released and all charges against her dropped. But the
investigation is still active and growing in scale. Police say there
are now 40 possible victims of contaminated saline, 7 of whom died.
Stuart Flinders has just come out of the press conference in Ashton
under Lyne, where police made their dramatic announcement. Stuart, what
did the police have to say? Two key point backs   firstly,
Rebecca Leighton has been released from prison. She was charged with  
  in connection with a number of suspicious deaths. She has been
released and is no longer being pursued through the courts.
Secondly, the police had previously told us that they were
investigating three suspicious deaths. They tell us now that in
who are believed to have been made ill through criminal circumstances.
Of the deaths, they believe that two are almost certain to have been
the victims of crime. What happens to Rebecca later now?    and
Rebecca Leighton. A police spokesman said she has been
released from prison and is free to go where she liked. He admitted he
was concerned for her safety because of the controversial nature
of the charges that she faced and that he regarded it as a
responsibility of the police to look after her. He expressed a
desire by journalists should not pursue her, although I have to say
that I imagine that, right now, there will be a camp of journalists
outside her house. She has been released suddenly, hasn't she?
this has obviously been a very distressing time for patients and
staff at a hospital. She was arrested under what is called the
threshold test. In other words, there was not sufficient evidence
for her to go to court straight away but an expectation that more
evidence which emerged as the case went on. That, clearly, has not
been the case and the Crown Prosecution Service tell us, it
would have been wrong for us to keep the suspect in custody
indefinitely. They do at that the law allows us to reinstate new
charges should new evidence come to light.
Residents are being moved out of a care home in Warrington after
inspectors raised serious concerns for their welfare. Some were
verbally abused, one went without medication for five days, another
was found in urine soaked bandages. The action was taken, not by the
care home watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, but by
Warrington Borough Council. In a moment we'll hear from the Care
Quality Commission. We will ask them what is the point of a
watchdog if a local authority is swifter to protect the welfare of
residents? First, this report from Jayne Barrett. Today I met Pat
Miller. Her mum, Daisy, is one of 15 residents who will be moved out
of Hollybush care home. The council refers to the process as "removal
to safety". She says she's had concerns since February. She went
to hospital in February and when I went to see her she had arrived
with a flimsy nightie. She ended up with a pad at the that was wet
through. The hospital discovered her mother had pneumonia.
The Care Quality Commission today admitted that care that the bomb
was nowhere near good enough.    care at the home. One staff member
told a resident to move as she was putting her off for dinner.
Inspectors said the care home owner, Adi Osani, was failing to meet
essential standards of quality and safety. Today she refused to speak
to us. In two weeks the home will effectively be closed as there'll
be no patients left, but Mrs Osani could move out of Warrington and
set up a care home elsewhere. She still has her registration. The CQC
could take it from her. It has yet to reach a decision on that. So
what has it done if residents have been moved, not by them but by the
council? They were first elected in May    alerted in May by have
whistled law. A final warning came today.
All of these residents have turned 90 and they have to find somewhere
else. As she left tonight, Pat told me
she had not told her mother has been used could breaker. Earlier I
asked Debbie Westhead from the Care Quality Commission of what point
was there of whistleblowers complaining to them if, in the end,
the CQC took no action to protect residents.
We have taken action in this particular case. We visited in May
when the whistle Blower raised concerns. We visited again in July
it. Three reviews and inspections this service has had since January,
in a very short period of time. Obviously, in that period, the same
serious concerns about patient safety kept coming back. If you
look at it from a relative's point of view, visiting every three
months is not enough. It is the provider's responsibility to make
sure they comply with essential standards. As a Watchdog, is an did
your job to make sure that residents are safe? It is. People
who live at the service are number one priority. We have served three
warning notices. The order of the homes still has her registration.
You have never given a fine of up to ï¿½50,000 to anyone, no matter
what they have done. Really, are you a bit of a toothless
organisation? No, we are not. At the end of the day we will make
sure that people are safe. In this case, it was the council but
stepped in and not you. We have been working with the council, not
just of the last few weeks but of a last few months. We have been
sharing information. They have also been monitoring the service.
you aware that you are in danger of losing the trust of relatives and
whistleblowers? I think that is harsh and difficult to answer. I
can guarantee that we have taken action, we have taken strong
enforcement action. We are seriously considering further
action. Residents remained in the care of those people who were
letting them down for months. That is not taking care of them, is it?
It is only this week that we heard of more serious concerns. The
manager left on Tuesday. I am frustrated that the order did not
put things right. We gave her the opportunity. She failed in her
responsibilities and now we are taking action. But you did not feel
in your responsibilities? I do not think so because we have taken for
action. We're working closely with the council and people like there
are now safe. The family of a Wirral man missing
since his teenage girlfriend drowned say they won't give up on
him. Robbie Crofts hasn't been seen since Sunday at New Brighton. The
body of his girlfriend was found on the beach there the next day. Today
Robbie's parents made an emotional appeal for information. Andy Gill's
report contains some flash photography.
Robbie Crofts comes from a large family. He has a young daughter,
Eva, from a previous relationship. Today his parents said the five
days he's been missing have been the longest five days ever.
need to come on, son. We will not give up on you. We love and miss
you very much. We feel you are out there somewhere. You need to let us
know you are safe. We are all worried sick about you. Robbie and
his 17 year old girlfriend, Hayley Holmes, went to New Brighton beach
on Sunday night. Hayley's body was found washed up there on Monday.
She had drowned. Her parents described her as one in a million.
Their shoes were found neatly placed at the scene with his mobile
phone in one of his shoes. They had only been going out for a few days.
The police say that the evidence is that they were an affectionate
couple at the beginning of a relationship. Police say they are
keeping an open mind over whether Robbie went into the sea as well.
What we know for sure is that he came home from a festival, went to
his parents' house. The RNLI are among the agencies who have been
looking for Robbie. Police say the decision on how long to continue
the search is reviewed on a daily basis. Andy Gill, BBC North West
Tonight, New Brighton. A woman who lured two teenagers to
a house in Blackburn where they were raped by three men has been
jailed for seven years. Stephanie Knight from Rawtenstall told the
Sixteen year old girls they were going clubbing. But instead they
were raped by Knight's former boyfriend, Amjad Hussain, his
brother, Shahid, and their cousin, Tanvir Butt, in December 2009. The
three men have been jailed indefinitely. Throughout the
investigation and trial they had shown no regard for the victims.
They have failed to acknowledge the role they have played. The
dangerousness of them is shown in the sentences given. I am really
pleased with the outcome today. The funeral of a Cumbrian man who
died after he was struck by a police taser took place in his
hometown today. Family and friends of Dale Burns gathered for the
service at St James' Church in Barrow this afternoon. The 27 year 
old bodybuilder died in hospital in August after police had tried to
arrest him. Last month's riots gave us all food
for thought. Were they caused by poverty or has there been what the
Prime Minister has called a 'moral collapse'? Some have blamed poor
discipline in schools, so is it time to call in the army? There are
plans for a school in Manchester run by former military personnel.
Will it work? Rachel Foley reports. There are no pupils, not even a
building yet. Just a big idea that ex soldiers could make a difference
in the classroom. One ex soldier, who lives in Droylsden, thinks it
might be worth a go. It would certainly bring discipline into
kids'' lives. It will hopefully give them a right direction in life.
The brainchild of a serving soldier from Manchester, Affan Clarke, the
school would be based somewhere in the city. It would be one of a new
breed of schools called free schools. Paid for by the state,
semi independent but playing to new rules. For example, the staff, the
soldiers, wouldn't have to have teaching qualifications. The
inspiration is an American scheme called Troops to Teachers. Proud to
serve again   that is our motto. Its mission    our mission is
improving the lives of children by providing an example that is worth
living up to. A head teacher in Burnage, just the kind of inner
city area the new school would target, isn't impressed. To have a
school staffed by soldiers seems to me bizarre. You want teachers in
school teaching, not soldiers. You would not go to a hospital which
did not have doctors and nurses and you should not really want to go to
a school that is not staffed by teachers. Before veterans of
Afghanistan and Iraq take on the schoolchildren of Manchester, the
project has to be approved. The school wouldn't open for at least
two years. Its backers say they want to produce not good soldiers
but good citizens. Rachel Foley, BBC North West Tonight. One of the
men hoping to roll out this new type of school, first in Manchester
and then across the country, is former head teacher and military
instructor Tom Burkard. Earlier I asked him if he was proposing the
military school because he was unhappy with the style of teaching
in our current schools. Indeed. There certainly would not be any
other reason for it. I have worked as a teacher as well as a military
instructor. I was given vastly more freedom to do as I saw fit as a
military instructor than as a teacher. I respect the teachers of
this country because they work under extremely difficult
circumstances. With the amount of micromanagement that there is, they
are completely unable to react to situations in the way they see fit.
These ex military personnel that will staff the schools and teach in
them, are they qualified teachers? Song will be, but this is not
something that we consider important. Teacher training in
Britain is something which is basically training young people not
to teach. When you go to be a teacher you are told that you're
supposed to be a learning facilitator and you are to teach
children to manage their own learning. When you take an a
literate pupil from an inner city estate and expect them to manage
their own learning, it is almost impossible to maintain discipline
and the class and it is in the realms of fantasy. Tell me when and
where you are expecting to set up this first Military School in
Greater Manchester? Unless the government might decide it likes
the idea well enough to help expedite us through the application
stage, there is no way we can start one sooner than two years from now.
The thing I want to stress is that this will not be a military style
school. We will not have combined cadet forces or have their children
doing military manoeuvres. We aim to turn out good citizens, not good
soldiers. To do this we need to have the best possible links with
the community. Thank you very much. No prizes for guessing the
highlight game in Super League this weekend, with second place
Warrington hosting first place Wigan on Sunday. A win for Wigan
will mean they finish top of the league going into the play offs, as
well as retaining the League Leaders' Shield.
There's a lot more at stake than the shield though, isn't there?
Yes, both sides are guaranteed home ties in the play offs but if
Warrington overtake Wigan it means they might end up playing the
fourth placed side in the playoffs, not the third. Also the Wolves have
another milestone to aim for. Here's Jon Cockrill. Thanks to the
Challenge Cup defeat to Wigan in July, will thus have had months to
prepare for this match. No such luck for The Warriors. We had to
work for everything we got. It was a great day. We make sure we had a
great time on Saturday and Sunday and were ready to go on Monday. The
boys showed they are ready for this weekend. Because they do not get
silver where each year it does not mean that they are unsuccessful. To
improve every year and to compete at the highest level shows that
they are the standard but we can be He has moved on from that and he
will be an improved player. He will go out and do what he does best.
Warrington's scoring record has been second to none. The Wolves are
hoping to break the 1,000 points barrier for the first time in the
history. We hope to get over that marred but there are no guarantees.
Every team but three that has achieved the feat has gone on to
Grand Final glory. Staying with rugby but switching
codes, and Sale Sharks get their Premiership campaign under way this
weekend. The Sharks' first match is away at Worcester. Boss Steve
Diamond has made wholesale changes, with 18 new faces coming to Edgeley
Park this season. There was disappointment for one of
our region's 2012 medal hopes today. Wigan's Jenny Meadows failed to
qualify for the World Championship 800 metre final after finishing
third in the semi final. Just five games into the season and
already The Shrimps of Morecambe are going to take some catching.
Four wins out of five, a 100% away record and just two goals conceded
means they are second in League Two. The man behind their best ever
start is former captain Jim Bentley, promoted to manager in May. But how
does the dressing room cope when you swap joking with your pals to
dropping them? Kieran Morecambe Bay is a
traditional way of showing your mate exactly who is in charge.   
here in more come, there is. Not any more. The new Shrimps boss has
had to rewrite the rules in his own way with the help of Assistant   
of his assistant coach. He has had to explain to the lads that he has
lined up next to for the last nine years that he is now the gaffer.
The lads have applied themselves but, right from day one, I have
tried to stamp my authority on it. Are you Jim are you the gaffer?
am the gaffer at the moment. that he does not have an ear to the
ground in the dressing room he just borrowed somebody else's. Is that
what he does, since you in on a mission? Yes, I am the liaison
officer. So they come and whinge to you and you go back to him. They
let me know what they think and it gets passed back to the gaffer.
So he has run over his mates, the board and the fans. If he wins over
Bradford tomorrow the gaffer Mike got to the top.
And finally Manchester has won a football double of a different kind
today. Sir Alex Ferguson has won August's manager of the month award
for guiding the reds to three wins out of three and City's Edin Dzeko
was named player of the month after scoring 6 goals in three matches.
We did not get to their right. Hopefully the forecast will go
wrong for tomorrow and you will get a better day than you are
anticipating. Saturday looks rather wet all the way through. Sunday
starts OK but there will be more rain turning up later. We thought
there would be a bit of sunshine today, there has actually been
quite a lot. The temperature was up to 22 Celsius. This evening will be
OK but if you are out very late, particularly in Cumbria and the
Isle of Man, the rain will be starting to move towards us. This
rain move slowly, which is not a good thing tomorrow. Overnight
temperatures will be around 15 Celsius. The rain will be
particularly heavy over high ground. The saving grace is the fact that
the so    the wind is coming from the south, bringing milder air. The
rain will eventually lead on Saturday. Sunday will start OK but
the next band of rain is waiting in the wings. Next week is also
They were known as Cooper's Snoopers. Named after the wartime
Information Minister, Duff Cooper, their mission was to gather details
of our everyday lives, things like what clothes we had in our
wardrobes and what food we were eating. The social surveys
conducted by the Office for National Statistics continue to
this day, and in a moment we'll be meeting a woman from Manchester who
has been asking some very personal questions for the last 40 years.
But first, this from Colin Sykes. From the glamour of the 1930s to
the more utilitarian look of the 40s, the 1941 survey of foundation
garments might seem frivolous today but it had a serious purpose. Women
were asked what underwear they were wearing at the time. Be found out
that, on average, women owns just 1.2 bras. The question   why did
the government might need to know? With food and clothes in short
supply, the Government was actually concerned about the amount of metal
going into underwear. They needn't have worried. They are all built
for thrift   very practical and cheap. The surveys began 70 years
ago. Another rarely set of questions looked at what food we
were eating and led to the Dig For Victory campaign. At this farm,
preserved as it would have looked in the Thirties, the survey made a
lot of sense. People ate a lot of potatoes, root vegetables. They did
not eat a lot of meat. Potatoes or one of the main foods, I would say.
8% of shop assistants wore born suspender belts, compared with just
2% of farm workers. I do not know what that tells us, I just thought
you should know. Back to our top story now. The
police are now investigating the cases up to 40 patients at Stepping
Hill hospital, including seven who died. Charges against Rebecca
lot of complex information coming out   what have you gained from it?
As we have been reporting through the programme, Rebecca Leighton has
now been released from prison. I can tell you we are expecting her
family to release a statement, probably a written statement,
sometime in the next half an hour. What happens now to our? It is a
question that I put to Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney a
short time ago. She has been released their way this afternoon.
We are in contact with our to help her back into the community and I
would ask that the media work with us to make sure that she has the
chance to return to a degree of normality with her family. At this
point in time there are no charges. Are there any concerns about a
safety? That that is why we are working closely, to make sure that
she is looked after. To sum up, the police investigation goes on
although it is no longer a murder investigation. 40 up to 40 patients
may have been contaminated and there are seven suspicious deaths
