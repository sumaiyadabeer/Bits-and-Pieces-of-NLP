France, Ireland and Britain. Time now for the money news. You're
watching the World Business Report on BBC. A warm welcome to World
Business Report. The headlines: A test for Italy, the government will
be selling debt amid growing concern over the European debt
crisis. As government funds Sakai back, many Greek pharmacies are
struggling to supply customers with essential drugs. The chairman of
the clothing retailer Esprit resigns, the second and to step
takeover talk. We have several developments in the
European debt crisis to bring you up to date with this morning. Late
on Wednesday, Moody's had its assessment of Spain's credit
worthiness. That is despite the 100 billion euros bail out to Spanish
banks announced on the weekend. They blame the recession on the
Francois Hollande is pushing for a greater role for the ECB in
stemming the crisis. There will be a test of confidence in Mario
Monti's policies later when the government sells debt on the money
market. Italians are uneasy about the economy of the nation and the
finances. Continuing deep unease on the
markets, after the Spanish bail out, Italy now feels the pressure. Its
interest rate 112 months Bonn has driven up again yesterday.    on 12
months bonce. There are conflicting, confusing signals. The crisis is
worsening, reads one headline. Italy will not need help, says
another. A month ago a
newspaper headline said, we are not Greece. This morning I sorry now
that headline saying, we are not Spain.    I saw another. Everyone
agrees that Europe needs to do more to help. Mario Monti says it must
take steps to stimulate growth across the eurozone.
If measures are allowed to allow for growth, the
finances of Italy will be sustainable. We will pay a lower
rate of interest, taxes will be la la and businesses will have an
easier time.    will be lower. More and more Italians struggled to cope
with the harsh realities of the President. I'm afraid.
I do not sleep at night because we have a bakery. We have six people
serving and three in the back, I had to let them go because there is
not work    not enough work. Is a market like this
is half empty, it means that business in general is going to
pieces. Although the crisis is felt deeply in places like this, what
really counts now is the mood in markets of a very different kind,
the money market, the bond markets. Italians can only watch and worry.
Pharmacies in Greece have warned that many stores will need to close
if patients are unable to pay the full cost of prescription medicines.
The pharmacy is used to be paid subsidies, but the farmers have
huge shortfalls. Imported drugs from pharmaceutical companies to
treat cancer    cancer are no longer being shipped.
It is a 30 in the morning and Greeks are waiting in line to get
their hands on the prescription medicines they need. It is hard to
obtain products. One man tells me he is finding it expensive for his
cancer drug for the 7th your mother. I had to wait for hours    his 70 
year old mother. It is the latest and most alarming development, in a
hungry and cash strapped Greece. International suppliers refused to
ship to graze without cash upfront. Businesses are heavily reliant on
state funds which subsidise medicines. The pharmacy is saved
from now want patients will have to pay the full pop    full cost of
medicines. Quarters own engines alone    this medicines must be
paid for in full. This man heads the pharmacy association.
Those who supplied the drugs from the pharmaceutical
companies continue to press their cars end not give us a period of
leniency.    continued to pressure. The helping to raise funds are now
all joined together and have stopped paying us and our last
money from 2011. As pharmacists, we can no longer make up the
difference. Not everyone thinks those trading medications are
playing fair. It is clear that public healthcare is inefficient. I
will blame the public sector as much as I do public companies and
professionals. They are constantly negotiating about new orders. And
money owed to them in an inhuman way. Yesterday we told you about
of the chief executive. The shares are tumbling again today.
You wonder who is left to run the company, because the chairman has
also quit. What is going on? As a result of that resignation of
the chairman, the stock price of Esprit Holdings on the Hong Kong
sessions. You have the chairman resigning, three resignations in
the stock price plunging. There is speculation that Esprit could
become a takeover target. Dallas about Manchester United, the
football team has decided not to have a public offering in Hong
Kong? That is correct. It has become so
fickle. There are reports that instead of Singapore, the plan is
to move it to the US. Sources say that man you is looking at listing
in New York with hoping to get a higher valuation.    Manchester
United. Manchester United could not be reached for comment. The
BBC. United received the approval for the Singapore stock changed in
November. Let squeeze in some more news. The
fine company BT, has for the first time one a share for the
broadcasting rights for Premier League football. They will
broadcast 38 shows per season. They will do this with BSkyB. BT will
produce a new channel to showcase the Games. Saudi Arabia and oil
companies had been asking for a rise in production.    asking for a
rise in salaries. A French rogue trader with a lead in the Court of
Appeals that his company passed off huge losses as a crime of his
former colleague. He told a French newspaper that he saw accounts
which proved that Soc Gen port's bad debts on to another company's
fraud. Another day of the declines because of fears of Europe. It will
