World of happy, world of happy world of happy.
A party was announced to find the king of cows a queen.
The lady cows all said,
"We must look gorgeous.
"Let's paint ourselves as bright as we can be."
But there was one cow who remained just...
brown.
"I want the king," she said,
"to know me as I am."
DANCE MUSIC The king cow danced with all the ladies
until he turned to one and said, "Please, marry me, my love."
It was the brown cow he was speaking to.
"But look at her!" the other cows all laughed,
"She's just so...plain."
"I'm looking for a cow to whom I can entrust my soul for life,"
the king replied.
"I choose, therefore, not with my eyes,
"but with my heart."
"Sweet cow," he said,
"your brownness speaks of honesty and truth.
"Please, let me love you.
"Please, become my queen."
"Dear King," she said,
"I will."
And she mooed a mighty moo of brownness
LOUD MOO that echoed like a song throughout the land.
