Welcome to Working Lunch. Here with money advice you can't afford to
miss. Fed up getting nothing for your
savings? You'd better get used to it. One economic forecaster says
interest rates will stay this low   this year, next year, and up to
three years after that. We'll look at what's the best
strategy for making the most from low interest rates. We'll check
We're spending the week getting answers from our regular experts.
Today, John Whiting tackles your questions on tax   from selling a
property abroad to lending money to a friend.
And   the last ever week of Working Lunch. You give us your tips for
saving and making money, and a few other memories beside that. I am
sure I will shed a tear, being the soppy person I am. I think the last
time I got upset about a programme was when John Noakes left Blue
Peter. I will be very sad when it finishes.
Official interest rates have been at a record low of 0.5% since March
last year. A leading economic forecaster says that they will stay
this low until the year 2014. Ernst & Young ITEM Club makes its
forecasts using the same economic model as the Treasury, so they're
taken pretty seriously. And it says interest rates need to stay at rock
bottom levels to balance out those government budget cuts that are
around the corner. Dominic Laurie finds out what this means for our
savings, mortgages and pensions. Yes, it is tough but also a fair.
When George Osborne announced in last month's budget just how much
would be cut from public spending, many economists said, wow, that's a
lot, and scurried back to revisit some of their assumptions   not
least those about interest rates. Interest rates have been at 0.5%
for well over a year and it is basically a waiting game for the
day when they have to start rising. The Office for budgetary
responsibility thinks that rates will rise as soon as next year.
Today we have learned that the ITEM Club, the forecaster, thinks we
will have to wait for years for the next rate rise. If we had to wait
for all ears, it would affect different people in different ways.
   if we had to wait four years. First, pensioners trying to arrange
an income through an annuity. you think about a pot of income and
to hand it to your insurance company and you say, I would like
you to feed that in monthly payments, if they can only get a
low interest rate returned, it means they will have less to be
able to hand back to you and it will have an impact. Many savers
will be fearful as well. For the savings, it will probably stay as
they are. They wouldn't go up any further than they are now. It is
really bad, the situation at the moment. I can't see a way out of it.
They need to do something. I have an ISA which I throw money into
long term. If it stays low, it is still making more money than not
saving. I suppose you have to ride it out and see how it goes. Four
years of record low interest rates would be mortgage holders' game.
is great news because I managed to overpay on my mortgage. When the
interest rate drops significantly, I carried on paying the normal
rates are paid off a bit of my mortgage last year. If they stayed
low? I would be happy about that. If they go up, I could be
struggling. My mortgage is 25% of my total income. If the mortgage
goes up, my leisure time goes down if it stays low, I might think
about moving up the property ladder. Having to keep on playing a waiting
game would suit some down to the ground. But for many savers and
pension holders, is it time for change? To look for different
products? It depends on who you think knows best about which way
the economy is travelling. Clare Frances is from the online
comparison website Money supermarket. We have many savers as
well as borrowers watching working lunch. I think the thought of
record low interest rates until at least 2014 will leave them in
despair. Absolutely. I think a lot of them have got a shock in the
last few months. They have been getting their annual statements.
The base rate has been on hold at more 0.5% for over a year. The good
news is that the best rates are more than the base rates. You can
obtain no point    you can obtain easy access and get between 2.5 and
2.8%. It is a far cry from two years ago but still a significant
premium. If you have money you can afford to lock away, you can earn
higher than that. Five year fixed rate bonds are paying 4.9%. If
interest rates stay where they are until 2014, of course you're not
taking too much away risk. What is the typical    too much of a risk.
What is the typical period to tie into a bond? They are available for
as little a six months. The longer the term, the higher the rate. One 
year rates are about 3%. It is higher than you can get on easy
access but you can't get at your money for 12 months. We are back to
the age old thing. If you want to make something out of your money,
you have to make a sacrifice. Either tie it up or take bigger
risks with it, which is what led so many people into the problems with
investing in the Icelandic banks? Yes. Since the Icelandic bank
collapse, people have become much more aware of the security of their
money. As long as the institution you put it with is registered with
the Financial Services Authority and the financial services
compensation scheme, up to £50,000 is totally protected. If interest
rates are to stay low, the banks and building societies, I would
think, would try to encourage competition and offer a better deal.
Should savers hold out? The key thing is to be vigilant and stay
proactive. A lot of people will have money in accounts that are
paying less than the base rate. The key thing is to check what interest
rates you are earning and move to one of the higher paying deals. The
benefit is easy access at 2.5, to 2.8%. Keep an eye on things. If we
see the market conditions changing, be prepared to move again. It is
never enough to leave your money are neck out. You have to manage it
   leave your money in an account. The borrowers will benefit from
lower interest rates. What should they be doing? If your mortgage
deal is coming to an end soon? Should you think about locking in
low rates? Should you look at something else? We have seen an
increasing demand for fixed rate mortgages. People know that when
the move comes, it will be upwards. We have    they have been talk that
rates could rise towards the end of the year. If they stay on hold,
towards 2014, it make such tracker rates more attractive. For some
people, there will always want the security of a fixed rate deal. The
great news for them is that fixed rates are really low at the moment.
If you look back historically, you can fix your mortgage rate for five
years at 3.99 per cent the key is to go for what is comfortable. If
you can take a bit of a risk and a gamble, you can get a lower rate
with a tracker rate. If you want peace of mind, fixed rate deals
look attractive. What about people who want to retire? They want to
buy an annuity when they retire? How hard part those rates being hit
by low interest rates? The problem is you only buy it once, so it is
not like other savings rates when you can move your money when the
ratings    when the markets change. The rates have come down a lot.
Having said that, there is still a massive variation between the best
and worst rates. People often think they have to buy their annuity from
their pension provider. That is not their case. As is always the
message with standard savers, shop around and find the best deal.
Thank you very much for coming on. Thank you for your letters and e 
mails about working    Working Lunch coming to an end this Friday.
Some people have asked if we are coming back in September. No, we
are not going to be in September. Thank you for your thoughts on what
we have done for you over the past year.    years. Pam and Alan Jacobs
say we managed to get them £400 after lace    checked up on old
savings accounts and found they had not been paid enough interest. This
Griffin said she was able to stop her husband paying too much tax
after we did a story about people being given the wrong tax codes.
cannot read out all of your e mails, unfortunately. Simon Gompertz has
been reading the mouse and has been able to visit some of the people
who have written    has been reading the e mails. We had them
put in two months ago. Paul is the proud owner of a roof fall of solar
panels, two months old and going He loved the wind turbines we
showed at the Port of Bristol. But the solar power we have been
covering was much more his size. thought solar energy was more
profitable. And farce, a better system. Has it been a help, to see
coverage of that?    and for us, a better system. Absolutely right.
All of your reports have been used for. We have managed to acquire
information from them.    have been useful. Then there was this barrier
company. Paul invested and won. They were listed at 60p at the time.
At one time they had gone up to about three pounds 57 had been a
good investment. How much did you make?    three pound 50, so it has
been a good investment. I made a few thousand, that is down to
working lunch again. Patricia Bristow is swotting up on tax, to
become a fully fledged tax adviser. Among her magic moments was seeing
Theo Paphitis, general business success story and investor.
Someone asked him a question, what is the best way to build a business.
He said, start small and growing slowly. I thought, that is what I
am doing.    grow it slowly. That gave me the reassurance and
motivation I was doing the right thing.
But that Patricia, nothing really matches our tax guru John Whiting.
John Whiting certainly added a spark to the tax side of things. He
made it sound interesting and something I wanted to look into
further. Patricia two two boys had to grow up watching working lunch
instead of children's TV. She is smiling but said she would be in
tears for the last ever show this week.
We are keeping the sparkle with John Whiting. You have a fan there,
at least. My first ever! Oh I doubted! How has tax changed since
working lunch has been on? The big word is changed. We seem to have
had continual change. It has got more complex, I have tried to
simplify it, so they have changed it again. This is the worst thing.
It is changed, changed, changed. People have difficulty keeping up
with that. I think if I have achieved anything in the years I
have been doing working lunch, it has been to its decline    to
explain and help them cope better with his continual changes. You
have been appointed by the government to lead the new Office
of tax simplification. How much more simple... What top three tax
issues Canute simper fly?    Can you simplify? It is a big challenge.
Looking at small business taxation would be in my top three. Looking
at the tax reliefs, are they really working, value for money? One I
would want to put on their soon his tax as it affects pensioners, the
older people. As we have heard so many times, the number of problems,
the brief is to look widely, to think the unthinkable. I will be
trying to come up with wide recommendations. Before people
write in and say, how about abolishing income tax, the
Chancellor has the final say. Wouldn't that be lovely? All this
week we are putting your questions to a different expect every day.
Today we are looking at tax. We have had many questions about the
taxing of investments. Several viewers have written in about
Spanish investments. The first of these is from Mike who says that he
holds shares in a Spanish company Cope. The dividends he receives
have 15% Spanish withholding tax    a Spanish company, Iberdrola. He
wants to know if he has further tax liability and what that change if
he had put that shares in an ISA? The short answer is no to all of
that. Spain knocks off 15% at source, it deducts it, that is
their withholding tax. We don't do that if we are paying it any other
way. He is also entitled to the tax credit he would have won a UK
dividend. Put those two together, they are both available for credit,
it is more than enough to worth    wipe out his basic rate liability.
Sadly he doesn't get the excess back and if it was received in an
ISA, he wouldn't get the money back anyway. It is one of those things
to think about when you are thinking, where do I put my money?
Looking at countries that perhaps don't have a withholding tax.
Pamela is intending to sell their holiday apartment in Spain which
she bought in 1998.    sell a holiday apartment. She wants to
know, for capital gains tax purposes, or will they eat    will
any taper relief apply? And could she end up paying 28% in tax on
Yes, possibly. Let's go back a step. She, it sounds as if she is
residents here, so the fact she is selling a property in Spain, she
will be liable to pay capital gains tax here. Spain will also be
interested in this disposal, so she may be liable to pay Spanish
capital gains tax, I think it is currently 19%. Having paid that,
she can credit it against the CGT she pays here. What we are into now,
you said tapering, that was the old system that reduced the rate you
paid the longer you held the asset. But for the last few years we are
into the flat rate, 18%, although since the Budget last month we've
got the higher 28%, which it sounds as if Pamela is a little worried
about. She could be into that if the gain is big enough, because it
goes on top of your income. But depends how big a gain it is. The
first tranche will certainly be at the lower 18% and probably covered
by that Spanish tax. But it's a bit of a complex affair. One way or
another there'll be a bit of a tax bill I suspect. On the taxes of
shares and dividends, Len says he is a non taxpayer. Each year Her
Majesty's Revenue and Customs pays the tax deducted on savings
accounts but not the tax deducted in his income and shares. It is
right I'm afraid. A big difference, interest and dividends. Interest
you lose 20% tax at source unless you are a non taxpayer, and fill in
a certificate. You can get that back. Dividends come with a tax
credit, a bit of paper that pays your basic rate liability, but you
can't get it back if you are a non  taxpayer. Talking about changes,
there is something that has changed to and fro over the years we've
been doing Working Lunch. Long, long ago I was happily able to say
you can recover it but not now, even if you have an ISA.
We'll get more from you later. We'll be saying goodbye to all our
regular experts this week and giving you a chance to get advice.
Tomorrow it is mortgages. On Wednesday it is benefits. Thursday
it is savings, and Friday, our last programme, we are going to set you
up for the future, answering your questions about pensions. You can
e mail us   working.lunch@bbc.co.uk. That's probably the best way. If
you don't have access to e mail you might be able to get a letter to us
We are cheering ourselves up this week by baking and eating cake.
They are baking and I'm eating. Now I'm not going to be on the telly I
don't have to watch my figure so much(!)S. That cake was baked by
deputy editor Nigel. It is honey cake. We'll put the recipe on the
website later. We are still waiting for the white smoke to come out of
the chimney at BP's headquarters. Tony Hayward is expected to quit
today. He is negotiating the terms of his exit. The boardroom
directors will have to approve Mr Hayward's resignation.
Britain's banks are under pressure from the Government to lend more
money to companies. Vince Cable is threatening punishments, including
penalties on bank bosses' pay if they don't boost lending. William
Hill is closing a call centre in Leeds and handing over its
Sheffield call centre to another company. That puts up to 350 jobs
under threat. The Rock is popular with bookies, because it has lower
taxs. Two out of every three pensioners
still gave money to their own children even though they are fully
grown adults. They hand over an average of £2,000 a year. Some pay
up to £10,000 a year to help the fruit of their loins buy a house or
clear students debts. The thinking is that BP still has a
profitable future in the United States, but the resignation of the
boss is the price it has to pay to rebuilt confidence. BP will tell us
tomorrow how much the Gulf of Mexico has cost it and how much ill
has to set aside to cover future bills. Could it be close to £20
billion. That could mean BP will end up announcing the biggest loss
ever made by a British company. Bank shares, the results of the
stress tests were revealed on Friday night. They said only seven
banks needed to raise extra cash to shore up their base. All of them
are small, all are on the Continent. The big four British banks all
You mentioned BP. Over the past few weeks the company's shares have had
ra roller coaster ride amid the company's efforts to cap the oil
leak in the Gulf of Mexico. Many pension funds own BP shares. They
rely on the BP dividend. And because it is such a big beast on
the FTSE 100, when it goes down, the rest are hit, with tracker
funds. James Bevan is on the programme.
Great to be with you. Let's hear from you how important BP is to the
performance of the FTSE 100 and other investment funds that track
the main index. BP is now the UK's second largest company, behind HSBC.
It's been around 5% of the all  share index, around 7% of the FTSE
100. More importantly people after income it's paid 12.5% of UK
dividends, so pain felt by BP is felt in spades by people looking
for income, people buying shares and the tracker funds. Which is
more important, the knock to the share price of the suspension of
dividends? It is the punishment that people have felt who rely on
BP to pay the bills with regular dividend payments. They said they
are probably got going to pay until 2011. If you want to spread your
money around a range of different companies this tells us that the
FTSE 100 is probably not the only place you should look? For a while
the FTSE 100 has been an odd creature, in terms of the spread of
sectors in the range of companies. That said there are plenty of high 
dividend yielding companys from the FTSE 100 index from which people
can choose. The global marketplace has an even wider range of high 
yielding companies to choose. banks and mining companies are
dominant. If you didn't want to be expose to do that narrow group of
companies, how would you devise your investment strategy?
temporarys of sectors one could look at the pharmaceuticals sector.
GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, both high yielding shares. We have high 
yielding utilities to consider, United Utilities, and the life
assurance companies such as Aviva are worth looking at. For a wider
spread, it is more sensible to look at open ended investment companies.
They also merit consideration. is tricky isn't it James to
understand how fund managers go about choosing their funds. There
are phrase sometimes liecs fundamentally cheap. It is all a
matter of opinion surely. How you trust that? The devil is in the
detail. If you want to play it, you really do have to study the small
print and get to grips with what managers are doing. There are no
short cuts other than if you want a quick look at what's likely to
happen, you need look at the style that a manager employs rather than
simply the current roster of shares on his books. James, lovely to have
you on the programme again. That was James Bevan of CCLA Investment
We were looking forward to the Whiting gallop. Running is extra. I
take my cue from you. As you can see, I haven't run a message for
some time. Peter has several sources of pension income, each of
them dealt with by a different tax office, so each year he ends up
getting four different tax codes. Apart from it being hugely annoying
he would like to know if all of these can be put together into just
one? No, unfortunately they can't, because they are coming from four
different pension providers, one assumes. A series of works pensions
or whatever. What the tax office is doing is taking his basic personal
allowance, probably the 949 higher allowance and spreading it out and
giving a certainly amount of tax  free to each of them. Or saying
you've got to deduct 20% on the rest. This is the way it is done.
What is important to note is that it is where things can go wrong. It
is very important to do a bit of a check up at the end of the year.
Either he may be asked to do a tax return or check it himself to make
sure he's got the right amount of personal allowance and not doubled
up for example. It is something we've talked about time and again
on this programme, and it is not just people who've retired but
people in work. Keep an eye on that tax code. Indeed so. On this
plethora of tax codes that some people get it is well worth keeping
a special eye on. If you are stuck as an older person, I will leave
the number of the website. Answers will be on the website as well.
They are indeed. Thank you. David asks what's the income tax position
when you decide to take a lump sum state pension after you've deferred
it for one or more years? He wants to know how it will affect his
upper earnings limit. This is an option only available for four or
five years to defer taking a state pension and then taking a higher
pension or a lump sum. It is taxed when you get it but at whatever
your marginal rate is. So if he is a basic rate taxpayer he will be
paying 20% on this lump sum. What it won't do is put him into higher
rate or the infamous claw back of the higher personal allowance. Sots
quite a reasonable system. Quite tax efficient in one sense. Paul
has offered to lend his son the money need to do buy a house, on
the basis that it is repaid at a proper interest rate. Paul is in
his 70s. What is his tax position? If he is charging his son interest,
as I presume he, is that interest is taxable. He is, dare one say it,
a solid little bank in his own way. Very reliable, but he is generating
income. It is taxable, and should be declared. OK. Marilyn has a
question on tax codes. Underpayment. Her husband had a tax bill in 2008,
as he did owe tax from previous years. This was settled through a
payment and change of notice of coding. He has now had another
letter saying they've found underpayments. This shouldn't
happen. No. It is Conservativeable that he did have an underpayment
one year because he wasn't taxed on a benefit, and the next year the
same has happened again. It sounds as if it is something that's not
happened correctly. It is something to probe, because normally it is
sorted after one year. So double reason to check what's going on and
to quiz the Revenue as to what are these adjustments and make sure she
or he understands them and gets it sorted. We never get through all
