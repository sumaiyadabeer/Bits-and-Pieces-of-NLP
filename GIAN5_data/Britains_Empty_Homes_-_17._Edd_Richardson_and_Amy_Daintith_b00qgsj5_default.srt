There are nearly a million homes lost and abandoned in the UK,
just waiting for someone to breathe life back into them.
Whether it's a semi or a rambling mansion,
we're on the search for Britain's empty homes.
We're combing the country for empty houses in need of rescue
and discovering how they can be turned into homes again.
I'll be showing a couple of house hunters the potential vacant properties can hold.
It's got so much character. I think it's really lovely.
We'll join the officials, whose work it is to get the nation's empty residences occupied again.
It guarantees that we know that there's going to be a successful
outcome for this property as well, which is good.
And we'll look around some formerly derelict dwellings
that have been brought back to life.
Taking on a vacant property in need of work
may not immediately appeal to the average buyer,
but they are worth considering,
because you can get more for your money if you know what to look for.
Edd Richardson and Amy Daintith have been together for nearly a year
and for the past seven months have been house sitting for Edd's mum in Portishead.
It's been brilliant. It's just time for a change.
Perfect timing for us to save a bit of money
and realise that we can live together!
Yes, yes. Test the water.
We love being outside and having a garden
and being able to eat outside and having people round.
The kitchen would be the hub of the house.
Somewhere we can sit and have a nice,
big table and hang out there most of the time.
Edd and Amy are keen for a challenge and aren't scared
  I'd definitely take on a complete wreck...
  Yes. Definitely.
But more out of naivety than any professional experience.
We'll do what we can and obviously get outside help.
I think, don't you think?
  We can't do everything.
  Yes, I know. We can try!
They also have clear ideas about the impact
they're hoping to create in their new home.
We want people to come into our house,
and have a bit of that wow factor.
Does that make us sound show offs? Are we show offs? Maybe.
To create their first home together and get more for their money,
an empty property could be just the answer.
  Morning, guys. How are you?
  Hi there.
  Amy, Edd, very nice to see you.
  Nice to meet you.
Can you give me a brief list of what your ideal property would comprise?
Two or three bedrooms, a lovely, sort of, kitchen diner,
a rural location with some outside space.
  Nice old features.
  A character property.
OK. How rural do you really want to be?
I don't want to be right out in the sticks. I don't think you do either.
  Walking distance to a good a pub.
  Yes!
Semi rural, perhaps.
In terms of location, where would you want to be?
With us both working in Bristol,
we want to be able to get to Bristol and we're quite relaxed really.
  As long as we can get in within about 45 minutes.
  Yes.
Remind me of the budget.
  230, tops?
  Yes.
  So, that's to buy and do the renovations?
  Yes.
Let's see what we can find you.
So, Edd and Amy want to find a place with:
With a total budget of:
I want to show them how a vacant property could make the most of their budget
and be tailored to fit the lifestyle they're after.
Which is why I've bought them 16 miles south west of Bristol
to the village of Winscombe to a former railway stationmaster's cottage
that's been lying empty for six months.
What do you make of this?
It's quite big.
Yes, it looks huge.
This one's up for auction in a month's time.
The guide price, according to the agencies, is round about 125   175.
  It could fall somewhere between that.
But even if it did go for 175, you'd still have
  55 left over from your 230.
  Yes.
  Exactly.
  You can do a lot with that.
  OK. Let's have a look inside.
  Show me more.
This cottage has a lot of flexible space on offer.
The downstairs is currently configured with a living room,
dining room, kitchen and bathroom.
Right. Come on in, Amy.
As you can see, it does require a bit of work.
Yes.
Thinking of space, imagine if this wall came out. All right?
You'd end up with all of this.
  Yes.
  Wow.
In which case, this could simply be living room.
It's quite a blank canvas, so it's quite nice to think,
it's easier to almost imagine what you could do with it.
A lot of the old character has been ripped out in the past.
There would have been a fireplace in that corner.
But one could look at reinstating these things.
Is that a cupboard area?
What we've got here is a downstairs bathroom.
  Oh, OK.
  OK. Which, again, would lend itself
to either staying as a bathroom or indeed a utility.
  Lots of options.
  Perhaps a look at the living space, yes?
Right. So, this is, I suppose, the back of the property effectively.
We've got this enormous room here.
Clearly, once upon a time, a living room.
Through there, we've got you what is effectively
a kind of pretty rough and ready lean to.
If you can imagine that whole wall going...
and pushing out into a new structure,
  occupying a similar footprint to what that does now...
  Yes.
Big kitchen diner here.
  Yes.
  Now, having seen the other half of the property,
I think, I could see myself in here,
this being the kitchen and it being quite light.
Whether we moved that out or not, it's a really decent sized room.
I could see this being a real heart of a house.
  Which is what you want?
  Exactly what we're looking for.
  Let's have a look upstairs.
See what you make of that.
Upstairs, there are three bedrooms
and a loo.
  This is what could be your room.
  The master bedroom.
The master bedroom. It's the biggest one up here,
so it's obvious that that would be the favoured choice.
It would mean that you'd get a family bathroom
in one of the other two bedrooms over in that corner.
Then over the stairs, there's this funny little corridor arrangement,
which comprises a loo and a sink.
You could get to that through here.
So, you could end up with quite a modest en suite for yourselves,
  and then you've got a family bathroom over there.
  Yes.
I like the idea of knocking through and having an en suite.
The ceiling's a lot higher than I expected and it seems a lot brighter,
but it 's still got a lot of those character features
that you want from an old cottage.
But there is the back garden to come.
Come and have a look at this.
Into the garden, this is the lean to arrangement
that potentially, you could totally redesign
  and incorporate into your kitchen diner.
  Yes.
  Effectively.
You could come this way a bit more with it, as well.
But if it had a similar roof to the rest of the building,
I think you'd end up with a really impressive garden.
What's really nice about it is that there's quite a lot to do there,
but just by transforming downstairs,
it would seem like a different property to what it is now.
We asked a local architect to tally up for the extension, open plan living downstairs,
reconfiguration of the upstairs to include
an en suite master bedroom along with new heating and rewiring throughout.
He seems fairly confident that £55,000 would sort it out,
which is what you'd have left, even if it went to 175.
I feel a bit like I can close my eyes and imagine how it would be,
which is quite nice with a property.
Sometimes you look at something and you can't see it, but with this, I can.
  Something to think about, anyway.
  Definitely.
  Good, right.
Vision is exactly what you need
when you're on the lookout for a vacant property to buy.
Asking family and friends to keep an eye out for you
can really pay off too, as Andy and Leanne Bradford.
were happy to discover when they were tipped off about this house in Colchester.
A friend of mine rang me one rainy Saturday afternoon
and she said, "I've seen a house that would just be perfect you guys."
It had an open day that day, so we whizzed over here
with about ten minutes to spare and we just loved it.
Even though, obviously, it had a lot of work to do.
Empty for about a year until they bought it, the house had been lived in
by the same family since 1935 and had been virtually unaltered
  since the 1960s.
  Everything needed doing.
We basically had no heating in the house, it was hard going.
The major thing we did here was put the extension on.
But the work didn't stop there.
One day I said, "The wall at the top of the stairs, is it supporting anything?
"Do you think that could come out? It would look nicer if it was airy."
I literally popped into the bedroom, came out and he was knocking it down.
We had to take all the walls down and start again,
because it just didn't work.
We put a in bathroom that we thought suited the house,
which is a claw foot bath. Quite traditional.
It all went pretty smoothly.
We were lucky.
Favourite part of the house
has got to be the kitchen and the family room.
Me and the boys spend all our day out here.
Rafty's room, I love. I just think that it's just a fantastic boy's room
that I wish I'd when I was younger.
I like the reaction when people come round the house and they,
most people say, it's a beautiful house.
I get proud when people say that you've done such a good job.
We bought the property for £265,000.
We spent about nine months doing it up and putting the extension on,
which came to about £45,000.
We've just recently had it valued out of interest and they said
  they'd like to put it on the market for £375,000.
  I love this house.
I love what we've done with it. It's a really homely house.
The boys are happy here.
We fought for it when we walked through the door on that first day really
and we knew we could make it a lovely and a happy family home again.
Persuading an absent owner to do something about their neglected property
is the job of a council's empty property officer.
Someone like Paul Palmer, whose beat takes in eight square miles
of central London, where an estimated 3,000 privately owned properties
lie empty at any one time.
No matter how big or small the premises,
it's Paul's job to do what he can get these homes back into use.
I'm off to one of my Mayfair properties.
This one's a good news story though.
Over the years, it's been bought and sold and bought and sold by speculators.
We threatened compulsory purchase order and the owner paid attention.
So, now he's on site, right in the middle of the works,
I'm going there to see how they're getting on.
This 250 year old, four storey building has
certainly seen better days since its start in life as a Georgian home
and has lain empty for seven years.
Owners are often very hard to track down,
but Paul has got lucky this time and has been able to get things moving.
It's a Grade II listed building. It's very old and architecturally
it has a lot of importance. We want to make sure it gets done properly.
  Hi. Paul Palmer.
  Hello.
Paul's here to meet Chris Georgiou, who's been charged by
the owner with the task of restoring this 250 year old building.
Right. So, this is it. How are you getting on?
Yes, it's been a struggle so far.
But I'm glad to say we're on programme.
We're on target...which is very encouraging.
  I'd love to have a look.
  Yes, please come through.
Being a listed building, Chris's team are obligated
to restore any original features they find.
This is the first floor.
  Right.
  We have some original wood panelling, which dates back to...mid 18th century.
So this is over 200 years old?
  Absolutely. Yes.
  Goodness me.
Which is one of the things that makes this property quite unique.
  Yes, absolutely.
  And all the lower level wood panelling is original.
Plasterwork, again is original.
So, you had a bit of investigation to find out what was original and what wasn't.
  Absolutely, yes.
  Yes, it's quite a job.
One floor up and Chris has an exciting revelation.
This is the second floor. We've made some discoveries here.
All the joists and beams are original.
Oh, wow!
And they're also numbered.
Presumably from the joinery shop before they were brought on site.
  A carpenter would have chiselled this out...
  Absolutely.
...and then they'd know exactly where to lay them on site.
  Like a jigsaw puzzle.
  Yes. And this was done over 200 years ago?
Near enough 250.
250 years ago? Goodness me.
That's real, living history, isn't it, eh?
But that's not all. Chris's team are uncovering artefacts from the past almost daily.
Just recently, they've uncovered something big
and need advice from Tom Burke, the council's conservation expert.
  That's interesting.
  Yes. Yes, this is...
We haven't been able to determine if this fireplace is original.
It is a very unusual fireplace with the free standing column elements on the side.
I haven't seen too many examples like that,
but it's got a classical design to it, which is,
mid 18th century, or late 18th century
and that's the building that we're in,
so it's conceivable that it's original. A very interesting part of the building.
Well, we're definitely keeping this.
We'll try and bring it back to its former glory.
Excellent.
All of this is music to Paul's ears.
Well, that was very satisfying. This property has been on our books for over five years,
a succession of owners who have no sympathy for the building,
just interested in making money.
So, to come here and find an owner who's prepared to bring it
back into use, restored to its former glory, it's made me very happy.
So, if there's a deserted place near you that you'd like investigated,
get on the phone to your local council and let them know about it.
Edd Richardson and Amy Daintith are looking to buy their first home together in the West Country.
They want:
For a total budget of:
The first house I took them to was well within budget
and just right for renovation.
Just by transforming downstairs,
it would seem like a completely different property.
And the second property I've lined up for them
is in the village of Ston Easton, around 14 miles south of Bristol.
It's a Grade II listed cottage that's been empty
for a couple of months since its owner relocated for work.
Right. Our second offering. What do you think of this one?
  Very cute.
  Yes. It's lovely.
  Sweet, isn't it?
  Really nice.
Now, the front of it, perhaps no surprise, is Grade II listed.
  It looks very characterful.
  Yes.
Now, it's on the market, wait for it,
for £166,500.
  Oh, my gosh.
  Blimey.
  Yes...fantastic.
  Yes?
Right. Let's have a look inside.
  Excellent.
  Come on in, Amy.
  Edd, can you grab the door?
  Yes.
A little porch way there, as you can see.
This space, which is currently a dining end.
  Then it all opens up into here.
  Wow.
So what do you think?
It's got so much character, I think it's really lovely.
The beams and the window seats as well and the little alcoves.
Yes? That's an amazing fireplace, isn't it?
This is the thing that really dominates down here.
It doesn't feel cramped though.
There's still quite a nice amount of space.
I think if you could knock that wall and that could be open plan...
  This is all just stud wall. There's nothing to this, it's like, paper thin.
  Yes.
And again, I don't think that would
really come under the guise of the listing.
  It's amazing.
  Do you like this?
  I really like it.
  Yes.
  Good. What is grabbing you about it?
There's just so much character.
The beams and everything, really.
And it's spacious, but small and cute.
  Yes, contained.
  Yes and I could see our stuff in it, as well.
Well, that's an important factor.
If you can see your stuff in here,
then the odds are it probably has a nice easy fit.
  Yes.
  Which is no bad thing. Yes?
OK. The kitchen's quite interesting. Have a look at this.
  Wow.
  How about that?
Nice oil fired range for you
and lots of ideas for you to think about,
but that's one of the structural issues,
whether or not you keep those walls there that separate the kitchen from the living,
this one, I would suggest, would go to give the kitchen that you're after.
Yes.
Upstairs, there is a bathroom and two bedrooms.
We've got two rooms of a similar size
and we're going to call this the master, for argument's sake.
It's got a little bit more texture to it, with this stone wall and so on.
A bit of storage over there, as well.
It's just a perfect size, isn't it, for a double room?
We don't need any more space than this.
A spare bedroom for people to stay
  and gorgeous features which is what we are looking for.
  Yes.
Go that way, Edd.
So, out through your stable door,
Amy, into this, which is, what you see is what you get effectively.
As an outside entertaining spot, would you use it?
Yes. I think I can see a nice table and chairs and a barbecue.
  Yes.
  Which is all we're looking for.
So, now for some costs.
We had a local architect estimate for reconfiguring the downstairs,
a new kitchen and bathroom, rewiring, central heating throughout and landscaping the patio.
He is confident that you could achieve
all that you'd want to do and a bit more probably, within the £60,000 left over.
Just fantastic. Which gives us leeway to spend it on making it look...
You can put your own stamp on it,
but again it's without having to spend loads of money,
without spending lots of time and taking a lot of that risk away as well because it's,
most of what we're looking for is already there.
And I think we could probably move in
and enjoy doing that and it wouldn't take too long.
  No. Good.
  A couple of hours to take those walls down.
A couple of hours, yes!
So, will Edd and Amy prefer this quaint little cottage
to the first house I showed them?
Well, we'll have to wait and see.
Meanwhile, back in central London, empty property officer Paul Palmer
is on his way to view a vacant building under new ownership.
I'm off to a property in Soho. It's been recently acquired by a local housing association.
They've just got the keys, so it's a chance for me to get in,
have a look at the property, meets the guys and see what their plans are for it.
Despite the building being designated residential,
prior to the housing association buying the place,
it had been used illegally for commercial purposes.
Oh, right. It's almost like a little self contained studio here.
  It's what it lends itself to.
  And you've got the office type lighting.
They weren't being used as they should
  which was good quality residential accommodation.
  Quite. Yes.
Another little kitchenette.
Yes.
Typical that, office blinds on the window as well.
The plan is each floor will have a three or four bedroom flat.
So, that will give us four really nice flats.
With the possibility of putting something additional on the top, should we get planning permission.
So, you're really going to design some really large...
Overall, these are big family units.
Given your track record of the work you do in the area...
Well, this is actually really nicely placed for us.
We have, the property next door is 60 flats that we've had for some time.
And with the school just in the backyard there...
  Yes, exactly.
  It's all really quite nicely contained for us.
It's good that we've got you on board because of your skill and expertise in the area,
it guarantees there'll be a successful outcome
for this property which is good.
I was very pleased with my visit.
Things do look very positive for that building.
We spent a lot of time working with different parts of the council
to bring about the change in ownership.
It's exciting and I was pleased I was able to get in
at this early stage and look to the future with some optimism.
And optimism is just what Sue and Martin Davenport needed
when they took on a dilapidated barn in Gloucestershire.
Well, I'd seen it many times as I'd walked along the lane
to go down to play cricket two fields down.
I always thought, this would be a super place to live one day.
I think we first realised it was available, probably about a year or so before we moved in.
I just saw a little peek and thought,
"Gosh, it's quite a nice L shaped building."
If you got rid of all those horrible buildings around it,
it might actually look quite nice.
For ten years it had just stood there doing nothing.
To look at it the very first time, your heart sinks and you think,
"How the hell will you make anything habitable out of this?"
The compromise with Martin was that I could keep the outside looking like a barn
and no building, but that he wanted the inside to be modern.
Having already got a builder on board, the project quickly took off.
Initially, it was real excitement.
Yes, the bricks were dirty, yes, the roof needed fixing, but the walls were fine.
All we needed were two structural supports in this larger of the two barns.
The rest of it was just down to digging out the floor,
putting down all the necessary concrete
and damp proofing and pointing.
Martin and Sue spotted the fantastic potential of this ancient building,
where others saw only a derelict barn, and made it their own.
It's only now that they're realising the potential financial gain.
The cost for it overall, if you put everything in, was just under £500,000.
What it's worth now, it's got to be worth,
half as much again, even in a difficult time.
No, it's, that's way under market.
And it seems it's not only the value of their home the Davenports can't agree on.
I definitely would do it again.
I'm not sure whether I would have a husband with me if I did it again!
  No, thanks.
  Never say never!
Off you go! Off you go!
If you'd like to turn a vacant house into a home, here is how to find one.
Be on the lookout for any places in your neighbourhood
that appear deserted and then ask the council about them.
Let estate agents know exactly what you're looking for and examine auction catalogues,
as they frequently put vacant homes under the hammer.
First time buyers, Edd and Amy are looking to buy a house somewhere near Bristol.
I've shown them two vacant places they could totally transform to meet their needs.
But has either of them got the potential to become their new home?
Let's take you back to where it all started in Winscombe.
What did you think of that one?
Quite exciting and a really big project, which I think we'd quite enjoy.
Yes. It was...you could really put your touch on it.
It was a blank canvas, wasn't it?
It had a lot of potential.
I could imagine what it would look like
at the end of, sort of, doing the project
and it would be a completely different house and that's quite exciting.
What did you think of the second one?
You really liked the second one.
I really liked the second one. It took over a little bit.
  Did it really?
  Yes.
  Why? Because it was that little bit...
It just had so many features to it, really good character.
It was homely, it was cottage y, which is what we were looking for.
So, I suppose it begs my final question to you. What happens next?
We need to, yes, go away and talk about that second property, I think.
I think, like you say, you've given us a lot to think about in terms of...
There was a lot to take away from the first property,
in terms of things you can do to a house to put your own stamp on it.
I'm glad we haven't put you off the idea of empty properties.
No, if anything, you've made us keener.
More excited about it, yes.
Well, that's the main thing.
Thank you very much and whatever you do, the very best of luck.
  Thank you.
  Thanks.
Deciding to buy an empty property is one thing,
but finding the one that you may transform into your dream home could take a little bit of time.
But I do think it's well worth the wait.
