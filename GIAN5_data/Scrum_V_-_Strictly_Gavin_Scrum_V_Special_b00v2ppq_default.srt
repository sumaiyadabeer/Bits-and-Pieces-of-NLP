One or two across Wales, perhaps We travelled to a hotel just
outside London, to interview Gavin Henson. What would he say? How
would he be? He had not been seen on the pitch for 18 months. But you
will have seen him just about everywhere else. Got up columns,
glossy magazines and reality TV shows. Tonight, we will find out
what has been going on and what is The potential is unquestioned. It
is that all there is? There are many sides to him. There are many
words to describe him. He has the ability to frustrate and the talent
to amaze. Controversy is, injuries and the media have played 10.   
played to him. But do the cameras follow him? Or has he got them? Out
of action, but never out of the news. The fairy tale romance ended
in heartbreak. What is the next chapter in the story of Gavin
Henson? Tonight, after all that has been said, all that has been
written, the man himself talks about his fitness and his future in
will only need one or two games to prove myself. About being a father
and the break up. It is the worst thing in the world to see you're
am trying to be the best father I can be when I do see my children.
About reality TV and the pursuit of fame. I always wanted to be famous.
I love my life. I love being Gavin Henson. And about his treatment in
the media. What have I done, for people to really have a goal like
So many words had been written about you, so many words have been
said about you, trying to describe here. You have probably done some
of this with reality TV shows and their applications. How would you
describe yourself at the moment? the moment? To be honest, I don't
want people feeling sorry for myself, but it is tough. Obviously,
the personal life has had things going on. Stuff has gone on with
Wales. I still live in Wales, though I am in London just now for
Strictly Come Dancing. My parents in Wales find it tough with the
press. I think it is a little on called for. One of the reasons why
I wanted to give this interview. To show what is going on. People will
listen to what you have said and I'm sure plenty will feel sympathy.
People will say that you need to knuckle down    need to knuckle
down and get back to work. IM in this position and, I feel that I
need a fresh start. I want to start a new chapter Mal Loy. I am not
turning my back on rugby. It is what I want to do. I want to play
for Wales again and I really believe I can play in the Six
Nations this year and the World Cup. Because I look after myself so well,
I think I could probably play for another 10 years, maybe. It has
been a while since he wore the red jersey. 18 months, to be precise.
But he has 31 caps, some crucial tries, two Grand Slams and a
British and Irish Lions tour on his CV. He is 28 years old. His debut
came in 2001 in Japan. It was that tackle and that kept that made his
name. In the past, I have been depressed and suicidal. Four when
will we see this again? I just want to enjoy rugby again. I feel I have
my drive and my hunger and my competitive back    might
competitiveness back. I am visualising and dreaming about the
game. I think I have reinvented myself. I will come back stronger
than ever before. I really believe that. I feel that I will probably
only need a couple of games to prove myself before the Six Nations.
IM close to being in the best shape that has ever been and. My injuries
have all cleared up. I can sprint again. I feel really fast. It gives
me a lot of confidence. For the last five months, had been
visualising playing. I really believe in the psychology of that.
I might only need one or two games to prove I have still got it. I
think the Welsh team has slightly missed me. If I can come back and
be as good, or better, then when I last played in 2005, which I think
I can, because my body is feeling good, then, yes, I can be in the
Six Nations squad. You know those statements will raise eyebrows. Why
do you feel so confident to say that? And having thoughts about the
game but have not had for a while. Positive, confident thought. I
really want to get back on that field. That is my stage. I have not
felt like that for a while. opposition do you see yourself
coming back at? You have played all the back positions apart from scrum
half? My favourite is Number Ten. I read like to go back to that. Maybe
play 10 for a club and then the transfer to Number 12 is doable.
Maybe I could play for Wales as 10. A have used spoken to Warren
Gatland or the Welsh management about what you need to do to get
back in? And no, I have not. the spoken to you? I have had no
contact with them at all. I... I think Warren likes working with me.
I think Rob likes working with me. I think they want me to get back
playing. I just feel confident that if I had a couple of games, people
would just see that I am back up there straight away and I'm really
confident. I am not letting any negative thoughts come into my head.
I'm really confident I can go straight back in and it is going to
be good. It is going to be a good story, I think. We have told Show
sales have soared. For some, the poster went down like a lead
balloon. I am not sure what they were thinking. It is totally
disrespectful for the players. You would not see Man United doing that
with David Beckham. I think it was ridiculous. I honestly didn't know
they were going to do that. I just got asked if I would do a photo in
the new Welsh Show. If there is always a risk, given your profile.
Have you done that? But with union and Strictly Come Dancing? Perhaps
I was slightly naive. There was no money involved. I thought it would
be good for grassroots rugby in Wales. Chance to put on the Welsh
jersey again. It was a nice feeling. It fitted well. Look, I don't want
to upset any current players are anything... If you have upset them,
how will you deal with that? I will be apologetic, if I have. Obviously,
I would not say it on the field, playing against them! I appreciate
where I am at the moment. All I want to do is be successful for
Wales and win more Grand Slam as for Wales. And be involved in the
World Cup. Before he plays for Wales, he needs to play for someone.
To date, he has managed 98 games for the Ospreys. Scoring 788 points.
He has nine months left on his deal but once out. The Ospreys gave him
an 18 months' sabbatical, largely unpaid. They want him to honour his
contract. I spoke to Cavan 16 months ago. It was a private
conversation. I respect his privacy. We gave them the time of that he
needed. He needed that time off. He was a contracted employer and we
made a commitment to him that we would wait and allow him to have
time off. And yet to have another conversation with the lad. You just
can't walk away from a contract. There is loyalty on both sides. I
think the Ospreys have done everything right.
I open my heart to the Ospreys and told them what has gone on. Four
compassionate reasons for my mental state of mind, I had to go
somewhere for the season because I felt a bit embarrassed to go back
into the changing room with the boys I know so well at the Ospreys.
They know me. They would ask personal questions and I was not
ready for that. I wanted to have a season away. I love the Ospreys. I
played for Swansea from the age of 18 and then moved on to the Ospreys.
That is my region. That is my club. I want to come back there. Now it
is an hands of the solicitors. I did not want this to happen. It is
tough. It is not a rugby reason that you want to leave the Ospreys?
It is the personal life? Why does that impact on the rugby? Listen, I
don't know... I know the players so well. Obviously there will be
banter and the relationship with Charlotte is all in the papers.
They know me so well and I'm quite a lot about the whole thing. I want
to be somewhere knew where people will be respectful and don't know
who I am. Just have a fresh club and see where I am, rugby wise. And
then come back to Wales. That is what there was thinking. With the
press on my back in Wales, but I look at Stephen Jones and Gareth
Thomas, the left Wales and suddenly they were saying they were
brilliant players and brilliant players because the left Wales, so
I'm thinking maybe I will get good press if I leave Wales, like the
dead. And then come back. So things that that goes through my mind as
well. Still, it is hard with the Shah that situation. There is
another man bringing up my children.    with the Charlotte Church
situation. I don't want people feeling sorry for me. For me to get
through this part of my life, I feel that I need time away from
London, because I have worked here with Strictly Come Dancing, and
then hopefully get a club. I was wanting to go back. We will see
what happens. The Ospreys have said it in public that they feel deeply
let down. They have given you an 18 month sabbatical. They have been
due were OK and give a new space. They feel deeply let down that now
when you are fit again you want to leave the club. I have had heart 
to heart talks with them. I am    I have not been paid by them for a
while. Things change in your life. You make decisions. Can you see why
they might be let down? Em... I suppose so. I have signed a
contract and I suppose they feel entitled... Mike has always stated
that I should come back and play for the Ospreys, which I will do in
time. At the moment, I feel that I need time away. I don't want to let
anyone down. That is the last thing... I am not that type of
person. A night B side the sophism this decision, but I feel it is
best for me and my family. I irritate to feel that I am letting
down the Ospreys fans. I don't mean to. I hope they can appreciate what
I am at this point in my life. Four Welsh rugby, I think this to be the
best thing for me if I just have a You mentioned temporary, are you
not looking for a permanent move from the Ospreys? This is just a
loan deal in effect you are after, is it? Maybe, yes, just something,
just some space and time I need. Maybe the end of the season,
because my home is in St Bride's in Wales and that is where I will live.
At the moment I just need to move away. It has been a surprise that
the dialogue and the    the dialogue has broken down between
you and the Ospreys. How did it get to that stage? When you were
injured last year, there was a definite dialogue going on with a
view to come back. How did that end up breaking down? Just because I
literally said I need time out, I need to sort out my relationship, I
need to sort out my injuries. My body was telling me that you need
time out, this is getting silly now. There is nine months left on your
Ospreys contract. Can you see a situation whereby you would return
some time in the next nine months and see out that particular
contract? I will go back this season if it has to be. How awkward
they would be about it, I am not sure. How would you feel about it
if you went back? I just told you what I would ideally like to happen.
I would not feel too awkward about it, I would do it. It is not the
end of the world, crikey. I have got friends there, it would be fine.
I would go back and hopefully get a game or two, and I think that is
all I need to get back into that Six Nations scored. We know you
have tried to get out of the contract, you have told us that
this evening. Have there been any other concrete offers from other
clubs? There was one report you signed for London Wasps. Any
contact with other clubs? No, none at all. Any signings for other
clubs? No, nothing. No, I have just... That is why I wanted the
Ospreys to say the contract is void. I think it is technically a void
because they have not paid me for so long but they are dragging their
heels on it. If it proves to be that the contract is still in place,
I will go back. It is a pity it has got to all of this. He said earlier
it is in the hands of the solicitors, so do you have legal
people at the moment trying to establish whether the contract is
void? Yes. Just to see where I stand on it, whether I am a free
agent or not. If I am a free agent, obviously my agent will go and
speak to the clubs. I think, being honest, I think London would be a
good place for me at the moment. I have not spoken to London Wasps or
nothing but that will come in good time. I think London Clubs would be
the best for me this season. I have just got to wait on the contract
side of things and that is why I have gone to Strictly Come Dancing.
Off the pitch, his life has become a media obsession. In tabloid eyes,
the rugby is the sideshow. His relationship with Charlotte Church
catapulted him into the celebrity circus. She was a regular at his
munchers, they were Wales' Posh and Becks, appearing on the cover of
glossy magazines with their children. But there was no happy
ending to the tale. They split after five years, earlier in the
summer. The sea is the stuff that seems to
have had the biggest impact on your life, not just your professional
life over the past few months. You have talked about another man being
involved with Charlotte and the children. Are you in a position to
say what went wrong in the relationship? Add 1 point, it
looked like you had at all. It was the Welsh golden couple, wasn't it?
That is pretty private. The last thing I want to do is bad mouth
Charlotte, she is the mother of my kids. We are just opposite and it
has not worked out. It is a nightmare situation, and obviously
it has been in the tabloids at the weekend again now so it is the
worst thing in the world. To see your kids being brought up by
another feller, it is not nice at all. I have just got to deal with
it and I am dealing with it, trying to be the best father I can be when
I do see my kids. But yes, I want my kids to see me playing rugby
again, I want them to be proud of me, I want them to see me wearing
the Welsh jersey. I would love Dexter to be playing rugby as well,
I really would. It is tough but I have got to be strong and mature
about it. Are you on speaking terms? Yes, crikey, of course we
are. We have got kids together, it has to be that type of relationship.
I just have to be mature and strong about it, and cope with it mentally,
and get through life as best I can. What was it like being that
relationship, post kids, and where it really was in the media
spotlight? I know there was a constant tabloid presence outside
your gate. Can you put it into terms how that would affect your
everyday life? Yes, it is tough when they are photographing your
kid. It wasn't a thing that really bothered me and Charlotte too much.
It was probably good for the side of her career anyway, being
pictured all the time. I think it helps her career anyway. Did you
caught it at all? There is the front cover of the magazine where
you have clearly agreed to do that, and people might say you cannot
have it both ways. I am not saying that, no. We did some good deals
with Hello magazine over the years and that money has gone into trusts
for the kids, for Ruby and Dexter. We have used them as well so I do
not really have any complaints about that. It was an experience
and I am not going to get that attention now. The to something I
will not miss. Wishful thinking maybe? The self confessed shy rugby
player has always had a contradictory love of the limelight.
He is starring in not one but two reality TV shows   Strictly Come
Dancing and 71 Degrees North. Is he image or substance? Player or poser
with tan and boots. He famously said, if I look good, I play good.
But he admitted that looks cannot help with anything    everything in
life. Especially girls because in my line of work, you don't get to
meet many girls. I cannot talk to girls almost I have had a few beers.
You are quite shy and reserved, and you are quietly spoken, yet there
is this other side to you   the magazine cover, the poster, the
swimming in the Lake, the dancing. Do you like fame? Do you enjoy
being in that public spotlight? don't know, to be honest. I am
still finding myself out, I am still much during. Various times
when I would just like to hide away, and my house is a great place to
hide away sometimes, but I don't want to have any regrets. When
opportunities come up like 71 Degrees North and Strictly Come
Dancing, I can look back when I am older and say I did that, and I
will be proud of that stuff. The fame thing... I always wished to be
famous when I was younger. It has its highs and lows as well, and yes.
When you go through tough times, it is not great, but I appreciate what
it is and it opens doors in so many other ways. I don't mind the fame
side of it and hopefully it will help rugby in general, if I could
make it more high profile that will be great. The the idea of fame you
had when you were younger, is it anything like what it is in
reality? Be careful what you wish for! It is OK, it is fine. The
difficult thing is the media side of things, the press, when you try
   they try to portray you in a certain way and change people's
perception of you. It is tough and I worry about that with the public
and what they are thinking. My family do not like it, when they
have a go at me for something and say why did I do this that all the
other. That is hard to deal with, but 90% of the stuff is way off the
mark. I just have to deal with it and let it go over my head.
looking at those sides of it as well. I have to think what I would
my life, I love being Gavin Henson, I would not change that for the
world. I am just trying to make the best decisions I can and sometimes
it annoys people. I think I have got a bit of foresight. I think in
the end it will turn out good, I really believe that. Once this show
is over, I will be back on that pitch playing really well and
winning things again for Wales. you going to do a Welsh dress?
shocking at the moment. What have you done so far? My first session
was with Katya Virshilas, my dance partner, he was stunning. I am
looking at the floor, I should not be looking at the floor. Any danger
that you might think over the next few months, this lifestyle, this
a strong desire to play again. I really have. I don't know, I just
want to put that Welsh shirt back on, to be honest. I miss playing in
front of all those fans, the Six Nations games, the World Cup, and
looking at my record now I don't think it is great and I want to
improve on that. The celebrity circuit, no, it has been formed but
passionately about wanting to play in the World Cup, but at the moment
you are contracted to Strictly Come Dancing. You have spoken very well
about your personal life. There is no way that you could have put
state of mind at the time, it was tough. You know, I... I believe in
myself and I believe I am doing things for the right reason. I
believe it will turn out well in the end. So the plan then, to win
