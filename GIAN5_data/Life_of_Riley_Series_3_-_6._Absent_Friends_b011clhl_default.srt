So here's your life
We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
We're certain
Nothing's certain
You'll be fine
I still believe that in this world
We've got to find the time
For the life of Riley
The life of Riley.
Are these eggs?
Er...looks like it.
Who was responsible for this?
Well, I hope it was a hen, or we're changing supermarkets.
No, I mean who's responsible
for putting organic waste in the household rubbish?
I can never remember which bin's which.
What do they do with it all anyway, apart from make more bins?
There's a little rhyme I use to help me remember.
Blue is for paper, Brown is for tin,
When Katy's not looking, Shove it all in one bin.
That works.
You're so irresponsible.
I've got the carbon footprint of a yeti.
Except they eat berries. So that's good.
No, it's abominable!
  That joke is so old.
  No, no. Not old. It's recycled.
Jim's jokes are like tap water.
They've been through at least five people before he gets to them.
Right! Bacon sarnies.
Fantastic!
There we go, my darling.
For you. Plate, please, Danny. Thank you.
Maddy? Aren't you forgetting someone?
Oh, you can all see him too? Thank God! I thought it was just me.
This is Russell, my best mate.
Wow. I'd hate to see the runners up.
I just thought Ted had had a sudden growth spurt.
What? He looks nothing like Ted.
Not unless he'd had, like, a sudden growth spurt.
Yeah! Nice one.
Hang on! That's exactly the same joke I just... Oh, never mind. Here we are, Russell,
nice to meet you.
Can you trim mine, please? Cheap bacon is very fatty.
I can see why you like this one, Danny. He's quite the charmer(!)
And crispy but not burnt.
Stop it, Russell, please! I'm a married woman.
Just take Rosie's porridge. She won't put up a fight.
I didn't mean it!
Vintage Russell. Here you go, mate, have mine.
Ah, lovely bills!
We get a lot of bills, don't we, Mum?
Well, to be honest, Ted, they're mostly the same bill.
But you don't have to pay them until you get the red one.
So why don't they just send the red one?
They give you warning before the threats.
You know, like I do with Jim when he won't mow the lawn?
What kind of threats?
Has to go to tango classes.
I'll do it on Sunday!
They're not serious, you know.
"Failure to pay bills within seven days could result in court action or imprisonment."
  Yeah. See, just a friendly nudge?
  Mum, are you going to prison?
No, darling, I'm not going to prison.
Ted, if I go to prison, it'll be for neglect or driving offences,
or some other crime. But not for this, OK?
  Right, I'd better pay this now, so go and get my credit card.
That's who the other red one's from.
Oh. OK. In that case, get Jim's credit card.
Jim?
  You OK, Jim?
  Not really, no.
What's the matter?
One of my best friends has died.
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
Sorry, Dad.
Are you having that sandwich?
Textbook Russell! I mean, sorry, Dad.
  Who was it?
  Ian.
Aww! Oh, that's awful...
Ian who?
Ian Buckley.
Awww... Never heard of him.
Course you have, Maddy. We were really close.
  The kids remember him, don't you?
  Yep...
Your age? Medium height?
White fella.
That's him.
Oh, it just feels like yesterday I last saw him.
When did you last see him?
Couple of years ago now.
We saw Independence Day and went for a Wimpy.
Went for a what?
Yeah, it sounds like more than two years ago, Jim.
Three? Three and a half?
Independence Day, released July 1996.
What? No, it can't be that long.
I thought it was weird, you talking about friends.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just...I don't really see you with people.
Your dad's just got a really close circle of friends.
Really close. More of a dot.
I've got mates. A lot of them are all the way up in Derbyshire.
It's not far. They're locked up unable to leave.
Actually, in a few cases, it is.
Cool.
And I've got this great big family now.
It doesn't leave a lot of time for friends.
I've got this big family too. Plus tons of friends I see all the time.
That's the great thing about adult friendships.
Sometimes you don't see people for years, or speak to them, yet you're still great friends.
Exactly. I've got loads of friends.
I just have no involvement in their lives.
That's about the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Kids!
They just don't get it, do they?
No... Explain it to me again.
I am on to you, Danny Riley. I know what you're up to.
If this is about the lipstick on your wall, it was Rosie. I helped her get the tops off.
No. It's about this weird new friend of yours.
Russell? He's not weird. He's just different.
  Yes, he's different from people who aren't weird.
  I happen to like him.
He's a freak! Even by your standards, which includes the guy who drank from puddles.
Ah, Josh. That was quite a summer.
So I reckon you have another reason for hanging round with him.
He doesn't look rich, so he must have a sister.
Ha! I knew it!
Her name's Lauren. She's amazing. This isn't a crush, it's a...
Creepy obsession?
Yes.
Then you've got absolutely no chance.
I didn't before I met Russell but now I get to visit her house.
And I can ask what she likes so I can pretend to like them too.
  So, basically, you're using him.
  Yeah, but he doesn't mind. Look, he's having a great time.
Hard to believe someone so gormless could have a goddess for a sister.
Oh, and yet here I am.
Danny, it's wrong. Imagine if all my girlfriends wanted to get with you.
Second thoughts, don't imagine it.
Danny, stop it.
Danny! Stop it!
Oh, you're gross!
Oh! Ding dong! I'd forgotten how sexy you look in a suit.
You don't scrub up too badly yourself.
Oh, do my zip up?
Or down.
Katy's babysitting, we've got the whole afternoon to ourselves.
And the funeral kicks off in 20 minutes.
What a shame because you look really fabulous.
Your friends should die more often.
I'm so sorry, that sounded nice until I actually said it.
I appreciate you coming along. I'm worried there won't be much of a turnout.
I'll go anywhere for free sandwiches.
Yes. Perhaps don't put it like that to his widow.
  No.
  Mum, can I talk to you about your bank statements?
No, now isn't... Hang on. Where did you get these?
This is confidential information.
We keep our financial documents very secure.
Jim gave me them to line the hamster cage.
Last place an identity thief would look.
Unless he wanted a new life as a hamster.
  I was very impressed by the amount of money.
  Well, good.
Until I saw what the letters OD stand for.
That happened to me too!
Hang on a minute, Ted. You're not to start worrying about this.
I'm afraid we're way beyond that point.
  Well, look, you're not to worry. This doesn't mean we've no money.
  I know. We've got less than no money.
Based on current fiscal conditions,
and long term economic forecasts, this family is unsustainable beyond the next two to three years.
Kids say the cutest things sometimes, don't they?
  Mum.
  No, Ted, I haven't got time. We're going out.
  Mum, you're burying your head.
No, I'm not. I'm burying someone else's head.
I have got to stop saying things like that.
Danny! Someone for you!
  That'll be Russell's sister.
Oh, he could do with some normal friends.
Between you and me, this best mate of his is a bit of an oddball   only breathes through his mouth.
Off you go then, Maddy. Enjoy the funeral, don't fall in the hole. ..Hi...Lauren?
  Yeah. I've come to give him a lift.
  Can I just say, "Amazing guy." I feel honoured to know him.
Right. Most people think he's weird.
But what is "weird"? Some people think I'm weird for liking old blues and jazz music.
  Really?
  What kind of stuff?
  Oh...Lewis Armstrong.
  Nina Simon.
  Billie Holiday?
He is my absolute favourite. Seen him live?
Can't say I have.
And my other great loves are ice skating, vintage fashion and dogs.
  Wow!
  All the things I like.
A Labrador in a beret...on ice. Pretty much my idea of heaven.
  That's amazing.
  I know! We've got so much in common!
  Hello there.
  Shouldn't you be watching Rosie?
  She's asleep. Who's your friend?
  Katy, Lauren. Lauren, Katy. Bye.
Oh, my God, sorry, where are your shoes from?
These are from the market.
You're kidding! They're not designer?
No. They were like a tenner or something.
It must be the way you wear them. Some people can carry things off.
  Oh!
  Yeah. Can you carry yourself off now, please?
I can tell you what stall they were from. Budge up, Danny.
Can I ask you what you're doing?
Can I ask why it says "Louis Armstrong" on your hand?
Looey?
It's the best foundation but hard to get hold of.
You can get it at the airport. I always buy, like, ten jars.
I like airports. They're good for... getting on planes. Or off them.
I can see why you get on with my brother.
You're a bit like him.
Yeah, Danny, where is your best mate Russell?
I'm giving him a bit of space, Katy. People don't like being crowded. Shouldn't you be watching Rosie?
I told you. She's asleep.
I can hear her chattering to herself.
Actually, I'm pretty sure that's my brother. We should be getting off.
  Oh, we should.
  Sorry?
Nothing. Russell! Your sister's here.
Katy, it was great meeting you.
Yeah, you too.
  Bye, um...?
  Danny.
Danny.
See ya.
  She. Was. Lovely.
  I know.
She liked my clothes and my make up and my perfume.
Great taste. I can tell why you like her.
  That's not why I like her.
  I think we are going to be great friends.
What? No, you can't! I saw her first.
Mm. Yes, that is a fair point.
  Is it?
  No, you insane stalker, it's not!
  Hello, darling.
  Hi. Good funeral?
You don't exactly award these things marks out of ten.
  No. Although if you did...
  What?
You could call it "Come Die With Me". I'm so sorry. I've kept my mouth shut for three hours.
I've got tons of inappropriate comments to offload.
It was very moving, thank you, Ted.
Did they bury him under the flowerbed like Mr Buttons?
No, because he wasn't a goldfish.
No, nor was Mr Buttons. He was Ted's old piano teacher.
They found him shortly after Mrs Buttons left for Argentina.
Oh. It was quite an event actually. Standing room only.
Yeah but it was quite a small venue.
  Not that small.
  It was the smallest cathedral I've ever been to.
But it did feel, in a way, like he was...you know...
  What?
  Flaunting it.
  He was flaunting his death?
  Yeah.
  No one likes a show off, eh, Jim?
Well, apparently, quite a lot of people did.
Can't help thinking, can you, how many would turn up for me?
But it's not how many turn up. It's about who those people are.
You'd come to Jim's funeral, Ted.
Well, what day of the week? I've got computer club on a Tuesday...
Let's not start finalising details just yet, eh?
I'm going to the shed. I've got work to catch up on.
Mum, I've drawn up a financial rescue package.
Ted, I'm not shoving you up a chimney.
I've looked at your bills and statements and you're not getting the best rates.
I'm worried you're not getting a childhood.
By changing energy providers, we can save £80 a year. Just sign here.
It just feels a bit odd putting my finances into the hands of a twelve year old boy.
Then see how odd it feels having my 13th birthday in a homeless shelter.
Yeah, all right, hand it over.
  All right, Dad? Working hard?
  Trying to.
  I'm coming to your funeral, no matter what day it is.
  Are you here because Maddy feels sorry for me?
No. I'm here because I feel sorry for you.
  And Ted keeps trying to get me to invest in an ISA.
  Well, I'm fine. Just very busy.
  And I wanted to say, if you need a friend...
  I've got you. That's great. Thank you.
  No. If you need a friend, have Russell. I've finished with him.
  Thanks.
Oh, but look, I'm your dad, I'm supposed to be helping you. What's going on in your life?
  I'm not really that comfortable telling you about my personal life.
  Come on. Katy does it.
  Does she?
Yeah. She tells me about your personal life all the time.
  Like this girl you've got your eye on.
  Well... OK.
I'm really into this girl, Lauren, and I'm trying to get close to her through her idiot brother
but now Katy's stolen Lauren and I don't know how to win her back. What should I do?
  Absolutely no idea, mate.
  Cheers(!) Good to have your input.
  Any time.
Not interrupting anything, am I?
  Just advising Danny on his love life.
  Oh, well, Robbie's here.
  If anyone can teach you how to chase teenage girls, it's my ex husband.
  Excellent!
Robbie's here to see Ted and he's got a mate from work with him. Is it OK if he waits in here?
Um, sure.
Come on in, Trevor.
  Come in, don't be shy.
  All right.
  Hello.
So, you work with Robbie?
  Yeah.
  On your way to a job?
  No.
  On your way back from a job?
No. Rob just...brought me here. Said I'd have a good time.
I just can't stop thinking about her. She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in real life.
Right. Tell you what, why don't you give her my phone number?
How's that going to help me?
Who said anything about helping you?
  Oh, cheers, Maddy. So how's Jim getting on with Trev, then?
  Yeah, all right. A bit shy.
Yeah, Trev can be a bit boring at first.
That's why I thought he'd get on with Jim.
  Jim, have you got a minute?
  Yes, please.
  I want to renegotiate my pocket money.
  Thing is, Ted, we can't really afford any more at the moment.
I want to negotiate it down.
Ideally to zero but I'll settle on 50p a week.
Done. Hang on, I thought your dad was here to see you.
Nah, I saw him yesterday.
So...why is Trevor in my shed?
Ah! Whenever I'm struggling to make friends, which is quite often,
Mum finds us another shy kid and sticks us in a room together.
  Are you telling me this is some kind of...
  It's a playdate.
  Oh, great(!)
Hey, some people meet their future best friends on playdates.
Well, this is awkward. No offence.
  None taken.
  You seem like a really nice guy.
I'm just not looking for that kind of a relation...
  Please stop talking.
  Right you are.
Maddy, we're not children. You didn't have to set us up a playdate.
I didn't! I didn't. I just thought you were two nice blokes who might hit it off together.
Yes, that's exactly a playdate. I'm so sorry.
  It wasn't necessary. I've got friends of my own.
  Yes. Yes.
  Like Robbie! You've got lots in common.
  Well, we've you in common.
Yeah. And you like to do the same things.
  I refer you to my previous answer.
  Stop it! Stop it.
Robbie is your friend more than mine. No, he isn't.
Well, we had a child together. That's a friendly thing to do, isn't it?
And then I divorced you, which wasn't even amicable.
I can't stay reminiscing all day. I'd better get off. I'll see ya later.
I'm so sorry, Jim. I just wanted to prove that people do like you.
And I appreciate the deeply humiliating effort you went to.
But I'm fine. I promise. Now please don't turn my shed into some kind of man creche.
  No more little schemes to cheer me up?
  Brownie's honour.
  Thank you. I'm going back to work.
Danny, Danny, get the address book.
I'm going to phone round Jim's friends.
  You just promised not to do this.
  No, the Brownie salute is two fingers, not three.
He's only got himself to blame.
You're not going to throw a party, are you?
No. Not a party. Just a...gathering.
Get together? At home? Open house? Soiree? All the same thing. No one will come and Dad'll feel worse.
  Right, just for that, you're not invited.
  Great!
  Just for that, you are invited.
Great(!)
Yes. We're having a get together, wondered if you could make it?
Oh, I see. I see.
How far exactly does your electronic tag allow you to go?
And just what time do you call this, young lady?
Quarter past eight. Have you been waiting for me?
  Have you had a good time with my girlfriend?
  She's not your girlfriend! We did talk about you.
  Really? Does she like me?
  Yeah. She thought you were cute,
in a kind of non threatening, immature way.
  Yes!
  But that was before we talked.
  You told her lies about me?
  No. Worse than that. I told her true things about you.
  Oh, God!
The poor hygiene, the... publications stashed under your bed.
But it was possibly the puddle drinking that sealed it.
  A one off due to peer pressure!
  If you say so.
  That's so shallow.
  I don't think she cared how deep...
  Not the puddle, you numpty. Your behaviour.
  Sorry(!)
Katy, Katy, you've got lots of friends.
Are any of them men in their mid forties by any chance?
I mean, I hope they're not, but now would be a great time to tell me.
Sorry to disappoint you, Maddy.
Oh, poor Jim.
There's something not right about this room.
It's...I don't know the word.
  Tidy?
  That's it. Are we expecting social services?
  No. Just in case people drop round.
  What people?
  Oh, I don't know, maybe friends of yours...
  Oh, Maddy, this is exactly what I asked you not to do.
  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but they were so keen to see you.
  Were they?
  Yeah.
  So who did you get in touch with then? Not Colin Burton?
Gordon from the Wheatsheaf? The old five a side team?
  Every single one of them.
  Wow! I haven't seen that lot in ages.
  And you're not going to. They can't make it.
  Oh. So who is coming?
  Evening, Jim.   Hello!
Ah. The Weavers. All the way from next door.
  Pretty quiet round here, isn't it?
  Well done, Maddy.
First party I've been to where the neighbours have come to complain about the lack of noise.
Hello there, everyone. Only me.
  Hello, Mum.
  Hello, darling!
  See, Jim, here's a friend.
  She's your mother.
Yes, I'm stuck with her. But she's your friend. Isn't that right, Mum?
  Depends what you mean by friend.
  Someone you like and get along with.
Well, depends what you mean by like.
It's fine, Margaret, don't worry about it.
You're my favourite son in law, I know that.
  All right?
  Oh, apart from Robbie, of course.
  This the party then?
  No. It's not a party.
  I can see that.
More of an...open soiree. A gathering together.
He was a good catch. You should never have let him go.
Well, I'm enjoying this tremendously.
Jim. The Weavers. They're our friends.
Maddy, ever since we met the Weavers, we've done nothing but irritate and upset them.
Yes but I think they dislike me significantly more than they dislike you. Go and chat.
  So, what's new with you, Roger?
  Finally got round to buying myself a telescope.
Online deal   you'll never guess how much.
Roger, the amount of money you waste on toys is of no interest to Jim.
Oh, sorry(!) Well, perhaps if you spend two hours
  recounting everything from your book group, that would interest him(!)
  Well, this is nice.
  At least they talk, share their feelings.
  Any thoughts on holidays?
  Yes. Like to share your feelings, don't you, Alison?
  Oh, that must be a reference to Craig from work.
  Yes, it is a reference to Craig from work.
  We thought about Ireland, but there's the weather to consider.
If you object to Craig, I'll discuss our marital problems with Jim.
Oh, my God, we're low on crisps! Do excuse me.
Hi. Lauren. Didn't know you were coming.
Your stepmum asked me. Something about making up the numbers.
  Can I get you a drink?
  Um...no, thanks.
  Because of the puddles?
  Sorry?
Because I'm not a puddle drinker, OK? I swear it.
  Right.
  I was much younger and... OK, I drank a puddle.
One puddle. Must I carry it round my neck forever?
  Come to think of it, I never mentioned the puddle thing.
  Oh. So you don't want a drink because...?
Not thirsty.
So where have you been all my life?
Not born for most of it.
  You tell me. Is it reasonable...?
  Oh, for God's sake, Roger!
Is it OK to hold a "staff meeting" in a bar on a Friday night? Would ring alarm bells if your wife said it?
Um...
Is that guy really a professional stuntman?
If by stuntman you mean builder
and by professional you mean rubbish.
He said I could have a part in one of his films.
Yeah, that bit probably is true so I'd leave now if I were you.
OK. I just want to say... I really like you. So, go for it.
  Go for what?
  I'm saying, yes, you can go out with my brother.
  What?
  I'm sorry I took so long. I'm just really protective over him. You must feel the same about Danny.
I really don't.
  But you passed the test. He's all yours.
  Isn't that great, Katy?
Yes. That is so great.
But, um...he's...not my type.
Not your type? What's wrong with him?
Hello, little cutie pie.
Nothing, obviously.
But... what would he see in me?
Oh, he talks about you non stop, don't you, Russell?
Yeah, she's all right, she's got a nice face.
  That's sorted. A perfect couple.
  It's sweet of you to be so understanding, Danny.
After all, Russell was only hanging out with you to get close to Katy.
Oh, cheer up, love. Have a gin.
  I don't think that's the answer, Mum.
  I don't know. I've had three
and now I can see even more people than are actually here.
  What's the matter, darling?
  I just feel I've let Jim down.
Well, he seems perfectly happy to me.
Look, he's over there chatting to at least three people.
  What a nice chap.
  Yes, isn't he? Who is he?
  I've no idea. Friend of yours?
  No. Never seen him before.
  Neither have I. What were you talking about?
You know, general stuff. I gave him a tour. He said he could see himself spending a lot of time here.
That's a bit over friendly.
  And he left his address and phone number to get in touch.
  Oh, right.
Did he say anything unusual, Jim?
Actually, yes, he asked if we were leaving the fridge and the tumble drier in the kitchen.
I said of course and he shook my hand.
I think you've just sold him our house.
What? That's ridiculous! It's not for sale.
It is, according to this leaflet.
  "Spacious four bed semi with executive garden office."
  Ted!
Yeah?
Ted, what have I told you about using my glossy paper?
  I don't think that's the bigger issue here.
  No.
Ted, did you really think you could sell the house and we wouldn't notice?
I just left a few flyers in the post office. Think about it, Mum.
If we downsize to a two bed, there's a chance we can stay solvent.
I better go   that stuntman's coming back.
So I've been talking to Guy Richie, he'll lend me his camcorder.
Hey. Where are you going? >
Call me.
Some brothers and sisters have really weird relationships, don't they?
I'm so sorry. I'm afraid our house isn't for sale.
My son is if you're interested.
But we shook hands. We had a deal.
I thought that was just a friendly handshake. I thought we were, you know, pals.
Try increasing the offer. We'll talk on Monday!
Ted? Ted, Ted, it's finished. Our finances are no longer in your hands. You're fired.
In that case, I'd like to reinstate my pocket money.
I need to build a rescue package for myself.
Something to fall back on when you crash.
Well, that's reassuring, isn't it, Jim? Jim?
Sorry. I couldn't hack it in there.
No, Jim, I'm sorry. I was only trying to cheer you up.
  Oh, and it worked.
  Did it?
Who was there? The Weavers, at each other's throats.
Your mum, pouring gin down her throat
and Robbie making advances on an eighteen year old schoolgirl.
  Yes.
  And how many of those people can I truly count as my friends? Not a single one.
So you're a lucky man to be blessed with not having those friends.
Absolutely. And, look, I got a parcel delivered today.
  Oh. Who from?
  Ian Buckley. He left it to me in his will.
  You know what that means?
  You're wearing a dead man's watch.
It means I have got a mate after all.
You do realise he's passed away.
It's the perfect excuse for not keeping in touch.
Absent friends.
Best kind there is.
Of course, you do realise you have got someone who's living and breathing.
Ah, you're right.
Someone who understands just what I've been going through.
Well, I like to think so.
Someone I may have taken rather for granted in the last few days.
Oh, I don't know. You've had a lot on your mind.
  And here he is. Trevor! You got my text?
  Yeah. I brought that Clarkson DVD.
Oh, mate! Whack it on, then.
Of course you meant Trevor! Of course you did.
I'll leave you to it, then. Great.
I'll just be in the garden if anybody...
..fine.
So here's your life
We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
It's certain
Nothing's certain
You'll be fine
I still believe that in this world
We've got to find the time
For the life of Riley
The life of Riley.
