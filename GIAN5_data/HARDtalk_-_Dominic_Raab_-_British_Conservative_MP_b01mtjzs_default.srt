purpose. Time for HARDtalk.
Britain's Conservative Party is under fire from all sides. Stuck in
a fractious coalition with the country's Liberal Democrats,
criticised in European circles for isolationism and split from within
between centrist conservatives, like the British Prime Minister,
and those pushing to the radical right, at least in economic terms.
Dominic Raab is a rising neo  liberal star in the Conservative
Party. But is his movement doing the party it comes from more harm
than good? Welcome to HARDtalk. The
Conservative Party promised tough measures to boost the slumping
economy. Do you think harsher measures are needed? I think we are
making excellent process. We are facing a huge debt crisis that has
not been fully understood. I think governments have made important
progress. Of course, we need to build on it.
Specifically? I'm not defeatist about Britain's
prospects. I think it is important for a backbencher like myself to
take a big picture view. Decline is not inevitable. We have to face up
to the debt challenge that we face. We have to plug the skills gap. We
need to reward and recognise, and value hard work. If we face up to
the challenges I think Britain's best days are ahead of us.
You have called for tax cuts and cuts to public spending as well. If
between 2012 2015. And yet the economy has shrunk.
First of all, we promised to cut the deficit within this Parliament.
We are one quarter of the way through doing that. That is solid
progress. In terms of firing up economic growth, of course we are
in a rut at the moment. We have created over one million private
jobs. We are heading in the right direction. We need to take a big
picture view. In the long term, the challenges we face are very serious,
we need to sharpen our economic edge.
Sharpening the economic edge, taking a tougher stance than with
what you were elected? You announced you're a Thatcherite, you
say the definition of fair dismissal should be widened. Small
business should be excluded from paying the minimum wage for under
21s. It is not very generous as it You described me as a neo liberal
star, I have never been called that before I will have to look it up. I
think these are practical measures. Take the minimum wage. Small
businesses are saying, we have got so much red tape, we are deterred,
we do not want to hire. I did not say it should be removed, it should
be suspended for under 21s, just for small businesses. We have got
youth unemployment of 22%. Who gives them a shot and an
opportunity? Somebody has got to speak up for the youth unemployed.
This is a measure which is not only important economically, but also
socially. Are you saying, speak up by
offering them less? At the moment they do not have a job.
If you reduce the minimum wage, reduce public spending... I did not
say reduce the minimum wage. Businesses are not hiring enough.
22% youth unemployed. If we can create more jobs overall, isn't
that a good thing? Isn't it better for those 22% to get into the
workplace and get that shot at making it? Making the best use of
their talents to make it up the professional ladder. It is a win 
win. If you have a look at France and the new President, Francois
Hollande, he has spoken in favour of increasing public spending in
education to give young people more of a chance. He is taking a
different direction. He says increased taxes on the wealthy to
give those who are disadvantaged... To be honest, he has not dealt with
the huge public spending problems they have got. It has been
ridiculed. The markets are increasingly worried France will
fall into a debt trap. It cannot be right to keep spending more. Let's
speak about Britain's problem. We have got household debt at around
80%. Banking liabilities of 450 % as a percentage of GDP. It cannot
be right to keep spending more. We have got to face up. We do not face
challenges from the US and within Europe now, we have got Latin
America, Asia, working hard and taking a much more aggressive
approach. Working hard as well. We have got to learn some of the
lessons. Looking at this country, spending
less has not boosted growth. Public spending has been rising.
Public sector job losses across the cuts have been part of the problem.
It is impossible to sustain when you look at the figures. We have
back loaded the cuts and public spending has been rising. We have
got too much public spending. It rose by 14% under the last
government. We are in an economic rut. It will take the dynamism of
free enterprise to pull us through it. We are seeing signs of that, we
need to go further. Should growth be more important
than fairness? There is a book you recently published, you argue we
have to ensure the general climate for business is attractive. We
should stop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie
between the north south, women men, but the focus of this coalition
government is we are all in it together.
What is going to drive economic growth? If you do not drive
economic growth, who pays the taxes that cover the revenue for the
public services? Unless you have got economic growth, you cannot pay
for those things in the public sector.
Is it growth over fairness? I do not accept that a zero sum game.
Unless we see economic competitiveness driving jobs growth
and tax revenue, you are not going to deliver social justice that we
keep talking about. The number one priority has got to be the economy.
22% youth unemployment. Who speaks up for them in this debate?
In the meantime, you are saying that fairness is irrelevant.
Fairness comes afterwards. That goes against the Prime Minister.
David Cameron, soon after the coalition was formed he said I want
to cut the deficit in a way that is open, united and fair. It is not
going to be fair if we do not look at the differences between north 
south, men women. What we are trying to do with welfare
dependency, make sure hard working families do not feel penalised
because they are not taking the easy option and sitting on their
hands and relying on benefits. That is incredibly important. If we take
a longer term view and look to the next 20 years, understand one thing.
We have got a huge debt problem. Five times the size of the debt
legacy we had at the end of World War II. According to the Economic
Institute for Social Research each child will have to pay off ï¿½200,000
of a tax bill in order to enjoy the same level of public services
previous generations have enjoyed. In order to improve that situation,
you say that Britain should learn Israel...
You are very damning when you come to your own electorate.
Once they enter the workplace the British are amongst the worst
idlers in the world. What we are quoting from, Niall Ferguson, a
respected historian. If you look back to the 19th century, what we
have got is a reduction in the number of working hours. Let me
explain. You have had a cheap shot. Before you quote about working
hours, according to the ONS, the out of full time workers in Britain
are the highest in Europe. That is aside from Austria and Greece.
tells you more about Europe. You are simply wrong. Are you
disagreeing... Since World War II, since the '50s,
average working hours in Britain have been reduced by one third. The
problem is not just the workforce, it is the fact we are retiring
earlier, despite longer life expectancy. It is also about the
welfare dependency we have got. Britain is not lazy at all, a
shrinking proportion of people in this country are pedalling harder
and harder to sustain and drive the economy and pay for the public
services we want. That is socially divisive. We talk about welfare
dependency, marginal rates of taxation. Hard work should pay more.
We are going to have to retire a bit later. You talk about the
declining British work ethic. Indian children aspire to be
doctors and businessmen, Britons aspires to be pop singers. We have
been ducking tough subjects, not focusing on maths and science. We
are talking about the length of education rather than the life
skills. It is not in the interest of the economy. Margaret Hodge
talked about Mickey Mouse degrees. You say I'm insulting the
electorate. Let me reply. Look at Ofsted's report in 2005. 50% of 20
year olds said their education did not acquit them for their first job.
We have been kidding ourselves with the education system. The fact we
spend so much time in the book talking about this, shows we are
not on some small state agenda, we are worried about some of the
public services that are critical for the long term future of this
country. As for the long term future, should it be inside or
outside Europe? This is dividing the Conservative Party. A thorn in
Voices inside the party saying to pull out of Europe. David Cameron
saying we are staying in it. vast majority, the overwhelming
majority of the Conservative Party think we need to renegotiate our
relationship. Of course the Prime Minister is in a very difficult
position because we did not win an outright majority. The Liberal
Democrats take a very different view. If you are trying to say the
Conservative Party is divided, that is not correct. There have been a
few voices, but you do not have the fractious divisions we have seen in
the past. You mean under the former Conservative Prime Minister, John
Major? You are seeing splits within the party, some people saying, more
power has to come back from Europe, others calling for a referendum.
They are saying roughly the same thing. Even John Major said we need
massive renegotiation of Britain's position. I think we need a
referendum at some point. My opinion is we need to renegotiate
the relationship. We want to break down the barriers and promote the
four freedoms. That is the vision I have for Europe. I think it is a
great thing. I would like to get back to that. I do not want to see
centralised government running economic policy and social policy.
We need to get back to a relationship focused on trade,
breaking down the barriers to commerce and with much stronger
economic foundations. I would like to renegotiate to that effect. The
outcome should go to a referendum. When the time is right. But if
there is such a renegotiation, that could damage relationships with
Britain's key trading partners. When the British Prime Minister,
David Cameron, used his veto in the important summit before Christmas,
you had the German Chancellor saying we look forward to seeing
Britain leading in Europe rather than staying isolated. It is a
dangerous game to play. It needs to be handled sensitively. I am not
anti European but there are two points. Any honest conversation
with our European partners, that we don't want to see moves towards a
federal Europe and if they go that way we need to move back. In any
event, we need to renegotiate our relationship in the way I described.
That is important. I do think we need to be sensitive in the way we
handle that. We also need to look at the big picture. You say it is
our major trading partner but since 2004 we have had more trade
internationally, exports and imports, with the rest of the world.
Put together? As a result of globalisation, the EU is important
but it's a shrinking share of our trade. In fact, it accounts for
about the 6th or 7th of GDP. Let's not kid ourselves. It is important
but there is the rest of the world, Asia and Latin America, where we
ought to be promoting trade. other side of the argument, those
inside the Conservative Party who are calling to lead Europe. They
cite that economic argument. Douglas Carswell is one
Conservative backbencher who's part of a small group calling itself
Better Off Out. He says the euro crisis has destroyed the case for
EU membership. He says we are now having to prop up a zombie currency,
that we didn't even join. He says to leave it. Douglas is one of the
great figures in the party. I am not calling for withdrawal from the
EU. I would like to see if we can renegotiate so we have a
constructive and flexible relationship. The truth is, in the
Conservative Party and the Labour Party, there are people who want us
to withdraw but that's not where I am. I want to be focused on trade
and commerce and make sure we get the best out of the single market.
If we can't get that re negotiation, perhaps we will have to look at
pulling out. It's a challenge for Europe and Britain. You have
referred to the pressures this Europe debate's putting on the
shaky coalition government. What is the question? The Lib Dems are pro 
European. We have a debate within the Conservative Party calling for
a referendum. That is putting a lot of pressure on a coalition
government that is already in trouble. It is new to the press
here but in other parts of Europe, they are used to a coalition
government. It is perfectly natural that you will have different voices
heard and different debates. That is not unhealthy. We should have
more debate, not less, and certainly with a coalition
government. There are many other stresses and strengths of a
coalition.    strains. The idea we walk around obsessed with Europe
every day is ludicrous. Back to Europe. Your strategy for growth is
seen, in economic terms... Seen by who? The BBC? You talk about cheap
shots. I'm just asking. They're labels. You are asking for the
minimum wage for the other... For public spending to be cut. This is
not the current government's strategy in regards to the economy.
I'm not sure about that. Look at some of the things we talked about,
cutting red tape. Vince Cable just announced he is taking on board
some of the ideas I came up with, like making sure... He is the
business secretary. Yes. He is taking up some of the ideas I
talked about. We should not see so many conspiracy theories go to the
tribunal. We are less snobby in this country with the idea that you
have to go to university. Many of the ideas we have been talking
about have been taken up by the coalition. It shows we should have
a balanced source of ideas and we should debate these things. David
Cameron has been labelled in parts of the British press, right wing
British press, as wishy washy and has been forced to do so because he
is in a coalition government. Whereas others in your party are
seen as more to the right of that. As it approaches the next election,
in 2015 in the UK, what will be the tone as regards to economics for
the Conservative Party? I'm not sure. Firstly, I believe David
Cameron is doing a very good job in very tough financial and political
conditions. There is a lot of tittle tattle in the media and
among some quarters of the Conservative Party, and I do not
believe any of that for a second. I will not predict whether the Prime
Minister will lead us. But we have to be clear about two things. We
are taking seriously the debt crisis that threatens not just our
economic competitiveness but the prospects of the next generation.
And we are equipping the private sector with the skills and also
cutting the regulatory burden on them so that they can deliver the
jobs and prosperity that we need in this country. Both in terms of
economic opportunities and, as I said before, somebody has to pay
for the revenue to pay for the public services we want and that
comes from the dynamic public sector. If the free marketeers,
this growing voice... Stop picking up on that label! Can the Coalition
survive that? If that gathers momentum leading ahead to the
election, can the Coalition live with that? Why not? If Nick Clegg
is calling for a fairer society and is much more wary about what areas
of public spending can be cut... Within the Coalition there are
natural tensions. I have already given you some examples. Some of
the ideas from the Coalition have been disruptive and taken on board.
   constructive and been taken on board. That's the way it will
continue. We will see these tussles and a sort of creative tension
between ideas but hopefully that produces a critical mass of ideas
on which there is a common ground, free enterprise. The Lib Dems
should stand for that as well as the Conservatives. Some of my ideas
are important. There is common ground and there is nobody that has
been more outspoken about civil liberties than me. Many of my
colleagues agree with that. There is plenty of glue in there to keep
the Coalition together. What about the party itself? Is David Cameron
the man to lead forward into the next election? Absolutely. What
about Boris Johnson? Many mention the gregarious Mayor of London as a
possible contender. But nobody is seriously suggesting that David
Cameron will not lead us into the next election. Boris has been
fantastic. It is incredible what he achieved in London, both in terms
of improving the city and beating Labour. But I don't think he or
anybody else in the Conservative Party seriously thinks that he will
be challenging David Cameron. He is the right guy to be leading us into
the next election and I have no doubt he will. What about, once
again, within the Tory party and within the Conservative Party, you
say it is all united. There are however figures, Liam Fox or David
Davis, that have been critical of the Coalition government, saying
more has to be done. It isn't enough just to talk tough about
spending but something needs to be done. You appear to stand with them,
not necessarily behind the Prime Minister. There are voices in the
Conservative Party that articulate conservative vision and ideas and
that is healthy. There are also others. We don't think that is
unhealthy. You don't seem to really understand why. Having constructive
debate, as long as it is not personal... We should have more
critical debate on policy areas and the big issues. The public want to
