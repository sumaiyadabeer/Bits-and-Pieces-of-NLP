OK. Life lesson. A lot of people think the Moment
a parent lets go of their child is at their wedding.
Not me.
Think he's crying because he's giving away his daughter?
Uh uh.
It's because she's marrying this guy.
the day she left home.
The trouble starts here  
college application season.
With over 4,000 colleges in the US,
I developed five reasons for choosing the perfect one
for my little girl  
academics...
distance from home...
campus safety...
distance from home...
and last but not least...
distance from home.
Which led us to the best choice  
Northwestern.
40 miles from our house, safe, great education.
I can get there in 28 minutes, clocked.
Now, you can never start a plan too early.
I'm James Porter, police chief, husband, Dad,
and the best part of my plan  
when Melanie finishes high school, she be going to Northwestern.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh! Oh!
You're in!
You're in!
OK. Baby.
Counsel for the defence
will now make her closing statement.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
my client, Mr Wolf,
has been accused of horrible crimes.
  That's my baby.   Destruction of property...
  Ha ha ha!   I know that's right.
But he is innocent of both.
Objection! Speculative.
I'll allow it.
Proceed.
The state has not presented
a single shred of conclusive evidence.
Yes, there is a house made of sticks and one of straw,
but they were both built to code.
That being said,
a huff and a puff
is not enough.
Let me hear you say it.
A huff and a puff is not enough.
Objection!
To what?
Rhyming?
Mr Foreman, have you reached a decision?
We have, your honour.
We find the defendant
not guilty.
Oh!
Yes!
Urgh!
Congratulations.
Thank you.
  Congratulations.   Thanks, Katie.
  My turn!   Oh.
Daddy's girl!
Ha ha, baby!
Oh. Grrr.
Baby girl, you knocked it out of the park.
Thank you.
But you do know he was guilty, right?
Dad, this is legal theory. Everything's not just black and white.
There are shades of grey.
Grey's just guilty with a good excuse.
No, actually, it's just...
OK, OK, OK, OK. You both have interesting points,
but the trial is over.
Now, Mama's rule is we go home and celebrate.
Ooh, yes! OK. Wait. I got to get something
  out of my locker.   OK.
  Oh, excuse me!   Oh, my goodness.
Oh, Miss Porter. Well done.
Wow! Thank you, your honour.
Your teacher mentioned you're interested in my alma mater.
Georgetown? Yes, sir.
Although it doesn't matter, because I've been wait listed.
You know, an old classmate of mine
work in admissions at Georgetown.
No guarantees, but I...
I could give him a call.
  Ah! Oh, my goodness!   Oof!
  Thank you, thank you, thank you!   I'll take that as a yes.
You're obstructing my airway.
Yeah, they're going to love my special sauce. Ha!
Smells good, babe.
Oh. Thank you, thank you.
Ah he he hem!
Everything all right?
Albert just beat me at chess   again!
Stop gloating, Albert.
Nobody likes a sore winner.
I need 13CC of orange juice, please.
13CC coming right up, baby.
Thank you, Mother.
He's playing chess with a pig.
He's just going through a phase.
A phase is when they want to be a cowboy. Trey's got issues.
Now, hold up, now.
Kids with high IQS, they got big imaginations.
And something about that pig,
he keeps eyeballing me like I'm cooking his cousin.
Pig ain't eyeballing you.
See? He's doing it right now!
Baby, look. Look! He's doing it right...
  He's doing...   What?
It's all in your head, James.
Little Houdini pig.
Ain't no Houdini nothing over there.
Do what you got to do.
Wonderful!
  Really? I feel like a house.   Oh, girl.
Oh, there's our superstar.
Hi, Mr and Mrs O'Malley.
I'm so sorry I can't join you tonight.
Celebrating, I hope, huh?
I'm just hanging out with a couple of mock trial friends at the library.
Total rager.
That's my baby. That's my baby.
CAR HORN HONKS And that's my cue.
I'll be back by curfew! Promise!
OK. Good night. Good night.
She is a pip.
Hey.
All clear?
Not yet.
Wait for the first wave.
Bye!
Second wave.
Bye!
Forward   party!
  Party!   Party!
TYRES SQUEAL Whoo!
So, any parenting advice for us?
What would you like to know?
We want a daughter like Melanie.
I mean, just tell us. I mean, not that I'm nervous.
You know, it's not that I'm nervous.
Ohh!
  He's just...   I'm sorry.
Relax. Raising a daughter is easy.
Take me and Melanie. We got a solid relationship.
There's nothing we can't talk about.
Oh, are you kidding? I can't tell that man anything.
I say left, he says right.
I say defence attorney,
he says prepaid excuse maker.
Ohh! That man is so rigid.
Rigid.
I'm flexible.
As Melanie's grown, I've grown with her.
He still treats me like a kid!
You clearly need to take your mind off things
and come on our college tour this weekend.
Saturday, we're staying at my sister's sorority at the University of Pittsburgh.
And we can even hit up Georgetown. It's not that far!
Oh, my goodness, you guys, I would love to,
but I don't think my dad will let me.
Lame!
Hey, girls!
Hey, hunter.
Hunter in the house.
We don't say that anymore.
I'm bringing it back!
So it might be emotional, and there might be tears,
but that's why they call it tough love.
Now, once they're potty trained  
uh uh uh! Baby, I think we've had enough parenting talk
for tonight, hmm?
You're absolutely right.
Why tell them when I could show them?
  Uh uh. No.   Huh? Huh?
Ta daa!
Welcome to the James Porter School of Raising Kids.
Our motto is, "Be there, take video." Ha ha!
Which one?
La la la la La la la la...
  Wow.   Super.
All righty. Ah!
My name is Melanie Porter, and I'm six years old.
Ta da! Whee!
That's my baby.
Whee!
Yeah. Yeah.
Dad, I can't move my legs.
I can't pedal.
Ha ha ha ha!
(In the future, all video will be implanted in our brains.
(Perfect.)
Why do you keep eyeballing me?
Seeing the O'Malleys tonight
reminded me of when I was pregnant with Melanie.
Doesn't seem that long ago.
I can tell you one thing,
I was not as uptight as him.
Oh, you were my rock  
right until they wheeled me into that delivery room.
Then you passed out.
No, I did not pass out.
I just didn't get a nap that day.
Well, it all worked out.
We got great kids.
That's why I can sleep at night.
Mmm.
  Good night.   Good night, baby.
All right.
Back! The pig!
Look! Look!
There's nothing there.
Go to sleep.
Little Houdini. He was ju...
Do what you gotta do.
Daaaaad!
  Aah!   Aah!
Mom! > Hold on!
Dad! Hurry up, please! >
< Mom, Dad, hurry!
< I can't believe it!
Mel?
Melanie, what is it?
'Miss Porter, Judge Mehagian calling.
'The Georgetown admissions committee is interviewing a select few students from the wait list.
'You'll need to be in DC this Monday at four.
'Congratulations, and have a lovely trip.'
Whoo!
  Aah!   Ohh!
SQUEALING Ohh! Ohh!
Whoo, whoo, whoo whoo, whoo, whoo.
Whoo!
Little bro, what are you so excited about?
I'm gonna turn your room into a science lab!
'For all of you who don't know, we live near Chicago.
'Georgetown is in Washington, DC
'that's 700 miles away from home.'
MELANIE AND Mom: Georgetown!
Happy dance!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Chicka ooh ahh.
SQUEALING Whoa!
Oh, my goodness. You guys, no, wait. He said Monday. That's in three days.
You know what? We should drive there.
We should make a trip of it.
Trip? What trip?
Oh, Monday. What?
Baby, I got two open houses this weekend.
Heh heh.
OK. No, but that's OK, that's OK.
Katie and Nancy are taking their own little trip.
Oh, my goodness! I could go with them.
They can drop me off. It's only a couple of hours from DC
SCREAMING Perfect. Problem solved.
I am so proud of you!
Thank you, Mommy! Thank you!
Happy dance! HONKS HORN
  Hey!   Hey!
I'm going to Georgetown!
Katie and Nancy.
Goodbye, Mom! SCREAMING
You girls be safe!
Georgetown, Georgetown, Georgetown!
  Come on, baby. Come on.   Perfect? Problem solved?
What happened to our big plan? We agreed on Northwestern.
Did you even know she applied to Georgetown?
I helped her fill out the application.
What? Whose side are you on?
Both of yours.
And put down that bat.
Look. You can't be on both of our sides.
Baby, Georgetown is a great school.
We don't know anyone there.
How will she begin to take care of herself?
Because you're an amazing father, and you showed her right from wrong,
and taught her how to think for herself and be strong.
She's ready for this because of you.
Nice try, Michelle,
but you and I both know, it's nothing nice out there.
I know this is hard for you, but she is not a little girl anymore.
OK? You got to relax. I'll see you at dinner.
I'll show you relaxed.
Are you sure you can't go out Saturday night?
My best friend from college is gonna be in town, and let me tell you this,
the Wizard is the party master!
Party master?
Wasn't college the best?
Total freedom to do whatever you want.
What?
I had my parents convinced I was an oceanography major
for a whole year, just so they'd pay for spring break in Mexico.
Mexico?
Oh, man. When I think back to half the stuff I did in college,
there's no way I'm letting my kid out of my sight
when she goes off to college. Not a chance.
  Aah!   Aah!
Everything OK, Chief?
I got everything under control.
I'm taking three days off. Ha ha ha ha!
I hope he doesn't do something crazy.
We're going on a road trip, a road trip
A road trip.
Whoo! (LAUGHS)
You guys, we should start really early tomorrow
because I cannot believe we're actually going.
I can't believe your Dad's actually allowing you to go.
I've been working with him for 17 years,
and he knows, you can be chief at the station,
but you have to be Dad at home.
That's right. You tell him exactly that, OK?
Thank you very much!
Ohh... Surprise! Ha ha!
Road trip, road trip!
Yeah, unh, unh, unh.
  Oh, no.   Oh, no.
Mom, this is crazy.
Have you seen the thing that we're driving in?
It's gonna be like a 1,000 mile ride along.
No. No. My life is a 1,000 mile ride along.
Why is he doing this to me?
Because he loves you and he wants to spend time with you.
This is cruelty.
What would make it less painful?
You said she could stay at the sorority house?
Her friends are gonna be with Katie's sister at Pitt.
Baby, that's right near your Mama's house,
where you're planning on staying tomorrow, anyway.
Look. This is daddy daughter time, Michelle.
I got a lot planned for us.
I shouldn't have to share.
Why are you taking this trip anyway, James?
I told you, to support Melanie.
Well, good. Because if this is one of your crazy schemes
to keep her at home, that would be real bad, James.
I got it all under control.
Are you going to DC?
Yeah.
I need you to take a message to the secretary of defence.
It reads...
"Dear Sir, I've created a species
"of super pigs to defend the country from our enemies."
You're gonna have to give that to him yourself,
and you may want to housebreak your pig first.
Already done.
'Welcome to Animal Kingdom.
'Gazelles are among nature's most social and emotional creatures.
'They look after each other for any signs of danger.
'The gazelle family stays together
'for as long as they live.
'Oh, how father loves his little gazelle daughter.'
That's what I'm talking about.
'If only humans could embrace this wildlife lesson.'
There's a double Dutch bus coming down the street
Moving pretty fast, so kindly shuffle your feet
Get on the bus and pay your fare
And tell the driver that you're going
To the double Dutch affair.
I love you, Daddy!
Mm.
Where does the time go?
Bye, Daddy. Bye.
Where's Trey?
Oh, he left an hour ago for his science club.
It's a all day field trip. I'll pick him up after work.
For Christmas, that boy gets a karate suit and nothing else.
Look, you be good, now, OK?
Mmm. I'm gonna miss you.
All right. You, too, baby. Be safe.
Baby, you call me, now, if you have any problems.
I'll be fine.
I was talking to Melanie.
Time to go, Mel Bear!
Ah. They are gonna kill each other.
Ba ba ba ba boo
Da da da da da da
You went to school to learn, girl
What you never, never knew before
Like I before E except after C
Why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you...
  Isn't this exciting?   Yeah.
I put together a little road trip kit.
I call it miles o' fun.
We got travel bingo, travel Scrabble,
travel dominos, and for your musical enjoyment...
Daddy daughter groove machine?
Double Dutch bus.
We used to sing it in the car all the time.
Play it, play it, play it.
We was doin' da da doo...
Give me a ho if you got...
Give me a ho! Ha ha ha!
There it is.
The double Dutch bus going down the street
And we've got to realise
If you don't know what you
Ha ha ha!
Oh, I love this song.
I don't remember.
Oh, come on. This was our song.
Sorry. I just don't remember.
Eh, that's all right. We can just talk.
Talk? About what?
Father daughter talks.
We're gonna get deep, too.
  Deep?   Real deep.
I mean, like, deeper than deep, you know what I mean?
Stuff that only we can get deep about.
Ha ha ha ha!
Deeeep. Ha ha ha!
Yeah. I just hope 700 miles gives us enough time.
Dad!
Oh, my goodness. Look where we are   Northwestern.
Dad, what are you doing?
Nothing. What?
This is supposed to be the Georgetown express.
Mel, you have to see more than one college
on a college road trip. What's the harm?
The harm is we have a lot of ground to cover,
and I've already seen Northwestern.
Not as a potential student.
Come on. Flow with me.
Flow with me, Mel, flow with me.
Ha ha ha ha!
Look at this place!
Oh, look at the trees, the fields!
It's like a four star resort with some books and learning!
Dad, just don't embarrass me, OK?
Go, cats, number one
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Unbelievable.
Oh, yeah, oh, yea...
Oh, Mel! Cats, baby! Number one! Mel!
And that's how in 1853
the university named the surrounding town Evanston
in honour of its founder John Evans.
He was a doctor and a builder
and boring, boring, boring. Questions?
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Uh. Mm.
  Are you sure?   Yes. Please, please, please.
Go ahead.
Hi. Doug Greenhut BPT  
booster parent in training.
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
We're up here from Orlando on our big college road trip.
Oh. This is Wendy, my daughter.
Hi. I'm Wendy Greenhut, CST   college student in training.
You have a question, Tinkerbell?
Oh. I was just wondering, when is parents weekend?
Early November.
What? That's three months after school starts.
Any other riveting questions?
Uhh!
Yes, Mr School Spirit with the foam finger.
Disregard his sarcastic tone... James.
How does Northwestern compare to other universities,
like Georgetown, for example?
Georgetown? Ha! We're better than Georgetown.
Excuse me. Hypothetically speaking,
if your dad was an overprotective control freak
and lived 40 miles away from Northwestern,
then would you go to Georgetown?
Yeah.
Who said that? Who said it?
I knew this was a bad idea.
Ohh!
I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
I am now.
Hi. I'm Nick.
I don't think I've seen you around before.
No. I was just checking out the campus.
How about a personal tour?
Personal tour of what?
Uh, Dad, this is Nick.
Nick, this is my dad.
I was just about to show Melanie around campus.
I don't have a problem with that.
  What?   I trust you.
Besides, something about this school feels safe.
Meet me back at the student union when you're done.
You kids have fun.
Can we see the rest of this beautiful school?
Okey dokey!
  Okey dokey!   You go, girl!
Ah, James,
I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship.
Wow! I wish my Dad was that cool.
Huh?
  Shall we go?   Lead the way.
Wow!
Wow! No, I'm serious.
I can't believe that was just the science library.
I'm telling you, this campus is like...
Yeah, I know. It's amazing.
I just kind of want to get away from the nest, you know?
Look, I hear you, but the way I look at it,
you have your whole life to do that.
I mean, my parents live less than an hour away,
and it's awesome.
I mean, I got a place to cram for exams when I need privacy,
free laundry, home cooked meals whenever I want.
Going to college close to home is where it's at.
You really sound like my Dad.
Well, the Chief's a pretty smart guy.
Hey, Nick. Can you, er...
can you get me a lemonade?
Don't you go changing.
Don't you go changing.
"Chief's a pretty smart guy."
Oh, it's on.
It's on.
So what do you do if you encounter an individual resisting arrest?
Well, er, we have Tasers.
No. Forget a Taser.
It's not gonna subdue any real criminals.
Dad! Dad!
Looks like somebody's having a good time.
Having a good time, Daddy, great time!
It was awesome! It was off the chain!
What have I been trying to tell you?
I don't know why I wasn't listening. So we went to the library,
  but we went to a frat party.   Frat party?
Let me tell you what happened.
I was like, " I don't want to go. I have to think about school," but he was like, "Come on. Let's go."
I said, "OK, for sure!" So we went to the party.
Crazy, man! Crazy!
There was a Jell o pool, and everybody was just diving in it.
I was like, "I can't take it."
Amazing. Northwestern   this is where it's at right here.
Where's Nick?
He was crumping, and he broke out his back.
You know, like that. It was crazy. Melanie! Whoo hoo!
I got your lemonade...
TASER ZAPS Ay, ay, ay, aah!
Sip on that. Sip on that.
Ooh! Pardon me, Ma'am, I didn't see you there.
See, I just transferred from Georgetown university,
where I was stabbed in the eye
at Georgetown!
You've got to be kidding me.
Stuart, she knows. It's over.
Everybody go on about your business. This is done.
Finito. Disperse.
You got to be kidding. We get paid, right?
Are you kidding me?
Hey, how do I get this cast off?
I can't believe you tried to trick me like that.
I am a good girl. I listen to you and Mom,
I do well in school. What's the worst thing I've done?
Dance around with my friends at a party?
Party?
When did you go to a party?
CELL PHONE RINGS Ooh. Phone.
If that's your Mom,
tell her we're having a good time, all right?
OK. Hello?
Oh, my gosh. The cutest guy just drove by us, and Katie was like...
Ooh. And he was like, "Eww."
  And we were like "Whatever."   "Whatever."
So, how's family bonding?
Oh, it's great. Yeah, we just left Northwestern,
and, er, my Dad Tasered one of his own deputies.
Congratulations. Congratulations.
  Nancy says congratulations.   Thank you, Nancy.
He says thank you.
No. He can't hear what you said.
I know. (LAUGHS)
I know! I know. (LAUGHS)
I know! I know!
Oh, girl, my battery's dying.
  Hold on.   Thank you.
Hello? Yes, I'm back.
Ha ha! Where were we?
I know!
Are you serious?
Construction?
Ohh, we're off schedule as it is.
We're never gonna be able to make it to Pitt in time.
  We're gonna have to use the siren.   Absolutely not.
No one touches my siren.
Dad, desperate times calls for desperate measures.
Mel, getting to a slumber party is not an emergency, OK?
Now reach in my bag and hand me P GIPS.
What's P GIPS?
Police global positioning system.
Why don't you just call it police GPS?
Because its name is P GIPS.
OK, Dad. Here you go.
Ah, there you go. P GIPS.
Oh, P GIPS.
P GIPS, route fastest time to I 23.
HIGH  Calculating distance to I 23.
Thank you, P GIPS.
  Thank you.   No. Thank you.
  Thank you.   Ha ha! No. Thank you.
Thank you.
Ha!
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do...
At the next intersection, turn right.
P GIPS. Ha ha ha!
At the next intersection, turn right.
Do do do do
Why can't we be friends?
At the next intersection, turn right. GARBLED
BEEPING Turn right. Turn right.
Dad, I think P GIPS is broken
because my map says that we're supposed to be going the other way.
You're gonna believe a piece of paper or a 40 million satellite?
I bet Grandma's right around the corner. Turn right.
Unh! Oh.
I love what Grandma's done with the place.
P  Thank you!
Ah, this is nothing. Don't worry. I'll have this fixed
and we'll be back on the tiny dirt path in no time.
Trey, what are you doing?
Going to DC, you told me to take the note to the secretary myself.
Have you been in here the whole time? Boy, you could have suffocated.
I built an air ventilation system. I could have survived for weeks.
I meant, we could have survived.
You're lucky to survive into next week
once your mother and I get through with you.
No service.
You just bought yourself a stay of execution, boy.
Ennchhh.
Ccchh.
Come on, Albert. Dad, what are we gonna do with him?
I have the most important interview of my life,
and I don't want Einstein and Porky along for the ride.
What do you want me to do, Mel? We're in the middle of nowhere.
We could leave them in the woods and a nice family of wolves will adopt them.
Dad, Dad! Oh!
Ohh!
P  Thank you!
Ehh! Ehh!
Dad, what are you doing?
I'm just gonna rock this thing over,
and we'll be on our way.
I just need a little momentum.
One...
Two...
Ohh! Ohh! BACK CRACKS
Something popped.
Something popped.
Dad, you need the man girdle thing you wear?
I thought that was Mom's.
  Now what's his problem?   I think he hears something.
What is it, Albert? Do you hear something?
Is it trouble? OINK OINK
Is it a fire?
Is Jimmy stuck in the well?
SQUEALING Jimmy!
He's been watching a lot of Lassie reruns.
Albert says there's a road up ahead.
I think I see a road over there.
Aha! Albert was right!
See, Mel? Told you everything was gonna work out.
This place looks nice.
Oh, no pets allowed.
Looks like Albert has a problem.
But, Dad, Albert's a member of this family.
Not by blood.
Now, this is the only hotel for 30 miles.
We don't have a car, and I'm tired.
OK. Do you have any ideas?
I have a thought.
I am dumping a lot of coin on this wedding!
I was told that they'd be throwing rice
at my little angel.
Yeah, I know.
  Hi.   Hi. How can I help?
We'd like a couple of rooms for the evening.
OK. How many are in your party?
Uh, just me, my two kids, and the baby.
Oh, somebody's getting hungry.
  I just gave you a bottle. Yes, I did.   I know.
Didn't I just give him a bottle?
He did. That is a hungry baby.
Yeah. He's kind of a pig. OINK
Michelle Porter.
Hey, James, baby.
Trey is where?
Oh. Congratulations on your dream home.
I'll fax you the paperwork.
Put him on the phone!
  It's for you.   Could you take a message?
Hello?
You are in big trouble, mister.
I hope you know how to build a time machine,
because you are not coming out the house until the year 3000.
I'll draw up some plans with Albert, but I can't promise anything.
Trey, this is the most dangerous thing you've ever done.
I'm sorry, Mommy.
'I know you are, baby.'
'Let me talk to your Daddy. Love you.'
  Hey, baby.   So are all of you all right?
Baby, we just had some trouble with the car.
No more tricks, James.
And feed my kids!
You know, Sigmund Freud said the best way to understand women
is by listening to them.
Yeah, but did he say anything
about understanding ten year olds?
Because you and the pig is loopin' me.
I'm confused.
Albert, go start the bath.
If you need us, we'll be playing chess.
Albert, that's enough bubbles.
Knight takes rook.
Hmm. Interesting.
Used your bishop as a decoy. Smart.
What are you doing?
Just fixing my hair, about to get ready.
Look, Mel, I know you must be upset about missing the sleepover,
but for whatever it's worth, I was totally cool with it.
Thanks, Dad. Uh...
Whoa. What are you doing?
  Making coffee.   Caffeine is a drug.
You don't take drugs. End of story.
Dad, why do you insist on treating me like a child?
Well, because according to the law, you are one.
How's it going?
Think you got enough stuff, Melanie?
Passion? She better not be...
'...with consistent showers for the next few days.'
'Thanks, Nick. Sounds like we have a rainy week ahead!
'Don't forget your umbrellas. After the break, how coffee makes you smarter.'
It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and finally found
The somebody who...
Dad, Dad! GARGLING
GARGLING What is it?
Dad, it's an emergency!
Where's the fire?
There's something wrong with Albert.
What's up with him?
Just guessing, but he might have eaten all the coffee beans you threw away.
Room service. I got cookies for the...
Oh, no!
Unh!
Trey, stay put. The pig's gone crazy!
< Albert, get back here!
Albert!
Get the pig, get the pig!
Where did he go? Where did he go?
Little Houdini pig.
  Ohh!   Oh!
There he is.
Ohh! Looks like we got ourselves a wedding crasher.
I'm on it.
Settle down. Settle down.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
At this time, I'd like to make a toast
to my little angel and my new son in law Ted.
And, Teddy, you had better take care of my little girl
because she is an absolute...
  Pig!   Pig.
Ohh!
Excuse me?
Oh.
Ohh...
  Pudding!   Daddy!
Get that pig! Get it, get it, get it!
Get him!
What's wrong with you guys?
No, Albert!
Albert! Albert!
Ted, don't just lay there. Get up and get him!
Albert, get back here!
Aah!
Aah!
Get him down!
My Cinderella wedding is ruined!
I'm sorry, but look, I didn't want a pig.
I told the wife, I said, get a little...
So this is your pig?
Well, it's my little boy's pig. He he... Albert, down, Albert!
Get him!
Albert!
Ohh...
Ohh!
Daddy!
Rise and shine!
Ah. We got to roll. Time to go.
There's a gas station 40 miles up the road.
Got to get some food in you. Who's up for pigs in a blanket?
SQUEALS What?
(LAUGHS) No. I'm not...
OK. Whatever.
SIGHS What a night.
They gonna have one wild wedding video.
Well, at least we know when times are rough
the Porters know how to rally together, right?
Yeah.
That's right. The Porters will rally.
  Oh, ho ho!   I don't believe it!
Aah!
Shiver me timbers. Ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
In the words of my favourite ride ever,
it's a small world after all.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, me and the little cowgirl... BOTH MAKE GUNSHOT SOUND
Just picking up a dozen doughnuts before we hit the ROAD EO.
What about you?
We just had a little trouble with the car.
  Ohh...   Ohh...
Well, new friend, your luck just changed.
Oh, we wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year!
Oh! Ho ho!
I just love Christmas carols, don't you?
Just give me a chorus of Joy To The World
and I'm as mad as a hatter! (CACKLES)
(They're crazy.)
I know but don't do that.
So, JP, looking forward to the big day?
What day is that?
The day our precious little ones shuffle off to Buffalo.
I got to tell you this road trip has been the greatest experience
for Wendy and I. I mean, there's just so much to talk about.
Yeah. It's like we're getting to...
(BOTH) Know each other all over again.
  Jinx!   Jinx!
Getting to know you
Getting to know all about you
Getting to like you
Getting to hope you like me.
  I like you.   I like you, too!
It was an itsy bitsy
Teeny weenie, yellow polka dot bikini
That she wore for the first time today.
So, Melanie, what other schools are you looking at?
Actually, I have an interview at Georgetown.
Wow! Georgetown! Great school!
So what would you study?
Prelaw. I want to get into the Cooper programme.
The Cooper programme! No way! I always wanted to go to Japan.
J Japan?
What about Japan?
Oh, sure. You study abroad at their sister school. Tokyo, right?
Tokyo?
Here you go.
Hey, look, Doug,
I really appreciate this. Can I help you out with gas money, anything?
Gas money? Yeah.
We charge hugs in this family.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ho ho ho ho! Ha ha!
Oh, one more for luck. Ha ha ha!
  Thank you.   You mean...
So long, farewell
Auf wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to you and you and you
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da!
See ya!
I call shotgun! Ha ha ha!
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
  Au revoir!   Adios!
  See ya!   See ya!
  Jinx!   Jinx!
So, er, we missed the bus,
but I did manage to get us a seat on a tour bus.
At least there won't be any singing.
Sister Christian Oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one
To say OK.
Yeah. This is much better.
Where you going, what you looking for?
It's just one semester.
It's not like I'm getting Japanese citizenship.
You want to go halfway around the world,
and I have to learn about it in a stranger's car?
I'm just disappointed.
We used to be tight.
I'm sorry, Dad. It's just that...
You don't tell me about Georgetown,
you don't tell me about Japan.
You didn't even remember our special song.
I feel like I don't know anything about you anymore.
What are we gonna do about them?
Oh, that was great. That was great. Let me just borrow the mic, sir.
I'm next. No. I'm let me just...
Give me the mic, sir. Let go of the mic, sir.
Hi, everyone.
Hi. Uh, first, thank you so much
for letting us on this bus.
My family and I, we're on a very special trip,
and I'd kind of like to sing a song
that my father and I used to sing
when I was little girl.
Ahem. MUSIC PLAYS
OK. Uh, brother,
I'm gonna need you to give me a little bass on this one, all right?
Like this.

And you said you didn't remember.
Well, of course I remember, Dad. It's our song.
All right, now, look. Tell me about this Cooper programme.
Oh, my goodness! It's so exciting.
OK. Let me tell you all about it. Um...
You're just gonna make a left down Maples.
Three blocks and we're there. Thank you.
Uh, Dad, do you think that Grandma still knows we're coming?
Well, I didn't call her, but it's not like she's going anywhere.
Just remember she's a old woman now.
She's not as light on her feet.
  Ooh!   Ooh!
  Whoo!   Oh, yeah!
It's my son!
Not the control freak!
Hide!
Give me some room.
No, not there.
Oh! Come on, come on. What's on your mind?
That won't work.
If you're ever in Okinawa!
Bye bye! Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Ohh. You know they're gonna have that song in their head
for the rest of their life.
Everybody needs a little Double Dutch in their life.
That's right. That's right.
Oh, wow. Here we are. Home, sweet home.
I just hope this surprise isn't too much of a shock
for her fragile heart.
You know, she getting up there in age.
She's 63.
One second!
We're here!
Hi, Grandma!
Ohh! Ha ha ha!
Not so rough. You'll break her.
Hey, Mama. Good to see you.
Is the coast clear?
Hello? Yoo hoo!
Now, Mama, I know you like the new security system.
Uh huh. I it's lovely.
Watch this.
Check this out.
Floodlights!
  Oh, my goodness!   Pretty impressive, right?
James, it looks like a football field.
Melanie!
Oh, my goodness! I can't believe it!
Oh, my goodness! It is!
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing here?
Yeah. What are y'all doing here?
After you couldn't make it yesterday, we stayed an extra night at my sister's to surprise you.
You can sleep over at my sister's like we planned.
Oh! This is amazing! Amazing!
Oh, this is the best, Dad, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Totally.
Thank you. Thank you, guys!
Mwah! OK. Bye!
Come on, you guys. Let's go!
Don't forget. We got a 10am flight to DC in the morning.
Dad, don't worry. I'll be home by eight!
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Good night, James.
You sure you don't want to wait for me to finish this?
I think I'll survive the night.
Albert and I are going to sleep.
Hey. Good night, Son.
You still mad at me for coming on the trip?
Son, no.
No, I could never stay mad at you.
You're my little man.
I love you, Dad.
Love you, too, Son.
Good night. Get some rest.

Where's Melanie?
'I don't know. I think she's in the shower.
'Hey, Bobbi. Can you check and see if Melanie's in the shower?'
Shower?
Oh, oh, yeah
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Mr Big Stuff
Who do you think you are, Mr Big Stuff?
You're never gonna get my love
Mr Big Stuff, tell me...
Mr Big Stuff?
Could I help you?
I need to see my daughter.
Who's your daughter?
Melanie Porter.
She's not a student here. She's just spending the night.
  It will only take a minute.   Who is she staying with?
Katie's sister.
  Katie's sister?   Yeah.
I'm gonna need a little more than that.
Ma'am, it's OK.
I'm a police officer.
Oh, thank goodness!
Where's your badge, officer?
It's back at my Mom's.
Ohh. You still live with your Mom. That's nice.
Look, I know what this sounds like.
Oh. Sounds like you're not getting in my sorority.
Bye bye, now.
Melanie? Melanie!
Whoo! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Melanie! Melanie!
Girls! Girls!
Melanie! No!
It's ohh!
Fight, fight!
Whoo!
Ow!
I got you.
Daddy's coming, baby.
Daddy's coming.
Ohh!
Oh, my goodness, you guys!
Whoo!
Mel, should I get my hair highlighted?
Ooh. That could be pretty.
Do you think I should get coloured contacts?
Ooh. That could be pretty.
Think I should get sparkly lip gloss?
Ooh. That could be pretty.
I am so glad we had this talk.
Wow! You actually talked to your Dad?
I talked to him about everything, my whole plan.
Major in political science, minor in American history,
and then to the Cooper programme for Japan.
Wow.
He was actually excited to hear about it.
I think I might have misjudged him this whole time.
It's the first time I remember us having a real conversation.
He listened to me.
He treated me like an adult.
I know he's done a lot of crazy things in the past,
but, on the bus it was different.
He changed.
I think he actually trusts me to be on my own
and make my own decisions.
Georgetown!
(SCREAMS) Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
No, no, no. I'm a father. Listen. Calm down.
I knew it.
N no. This ain't what it looks...
Where is he? Still no answer.
We're gonna miss our flight.
You got to line up the colours.
Hello?
Yes. This is she.
What?
He's where?
Oh, I cannot believe this.
For the last time, I have to get my daughter to Georgetown.
Right. Sure. Yeah.
Come in.
Hi. My name is Melanie Porter.
I got a call about my father. Is he OK?
The individual in custody was discovered this morning on campus
sleeping underneath a girl's bed at the Omega Psi Lambda house.
Mel, hey! Baby girl,
you ain't gonna believe what happened.
I tried calling you, and some guy answered the phone,
and it was kind...
This man is not my father.
Melanie Porter.
Because my father would never cross the line like that.
He would trust me to make smart choices.
Excuse me, but I have a flight to catch.
Mel! Mel, don't walk away, Mel!
Roger Wilco. Over and out.
You're free to go.
Someone sprung you.
James.
Mama, what's going on?
And where's Melanie and Trey?
Trey's taking Albert for a walk,
and Melanie's trying to catch her plane.
And you let her go without me?
Sit down, James.
Melanie told me what happened at Northwestern.
I can explain that.
Oh, you didn't want her to go to Georgetown,
so you concocted some ridiculous plan.
I'm just trying to keep everybody safe.
James, you took my home and you turned it into a high security prison.
You can't even let her spend the night with some friends
without creeping around like a cat burglar.
What do you expect me to do? How am I supposed to know she's safe
if she goes all the way to Washington?
James, how do you think I felt when you left to join the army?
I don't know, Mama.
I was terrified! I worried about you all the time.
I still do.
But you had to follow your own path,
and I had to let you leave the nest.
I wanted you home every day you were gone,
but I had to trust you.
I had to trust that you could take care of yourself,
and I had to believe in you,
so why can't you believe in her?
I'll see you back at home.
Is Mom gonna kill me?
I got your back on this one. Just don't let it happen again.
Good luck. All right.
You'll need this.
Mama, I love you.
I love you, too, son.
Bye, Dad!
Excuse me. The flight to DC, has it left yet?
I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid you've missed it.
Mel.
Hi.
You missed the flight.
I wouldn't have if you wouldn't have gotten yourself arrested.
Mel, look. I was...
Dad, listen. Georgetown is... It's over.
You know, you're getting exactly what you wanted  
me closer to home.
Baby, that's what I came here to tell you.
I don't want that anymore.
What are you talking about?
You know...
Dads don't know everything.
We just try to do the best we can.
Last night when I came to the sorority house,
I was trying to protect you.
That's what I do. I protect people.
Sometimes I go too far.
In this case, I went way too far.
Dad...
No, baby, look, I love you,
but I was so into what I wanted for you
that I couldn't see what you wanted.
I want what every girl wants.
I want a Dad who loves me, who adores me.
I want you to know that you raised a really good girl.
I want you to trust me.
I guess I still see you as that little six year old girl
singing Double Dutch Bus.
I'm not that little girl anymore, Daddy.
I've grown up.
Reality is, you've shown me I can trust you.
You have.
OK, I'll make a deal with you.
No more my plan, only your plan.
Now let's get you to Georgetown.
Deal.
That's right. Oh...
I don't care if Bob's here or not.
We got to be in DC by 3:30.
DC flow with me, Mel. Flow with me.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh...
This plane going to Washington?
Yeah, but it's for team members only.
We got a police emergency. You have to let us on that plane.
You guys divers?
Yeah. Big time. Huge divers.
Sss. Ehhhh.
Since I was a baby!
Well, climb on board.
You got me running going out of my mind
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Whoo hoo
I'll tell once more before I get on the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down.
We did it.
Yeah. We did it.
Excuse me. I never heard of a diving team
having their own plane.
It would be pretty hard to do our thing without one.
Ha! I thought all you need is a swimming pool and a bouncy board.
Wrong kind of diving team, man.
Well, what sort of diving team are you?
Aah! Aah!
Rock and roll! Whoo!
Dad, Dad, a skydiving team!
You mean, we're not landing in DC?
We are, but the plane's not.
But we got to get to Georgetown now!
There's only one way that's gonna happen.
Don't bring me down...
Whoo!
Go, go!
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down.
  Mel?   Huh?
We can do this!
OK, Dad. OK?
We got to get to Georgetown!
OK, Daddy!
All right. One, two, three!
Now, that's a great Dad. Whoo!
That you're running away
Don't bring me down...
Dad, pull the cord!
What?
Pull the cord!
Oh, oh, yeah. The cord!
Don't bring me down.
Sorry about the wedding, Lou.
Nice try, Phil, but you're not gonna psych me out.
After I make this putt, you owe me 20,000.
Happy days are here again.
Look out!
Aah!
Ohh!
That was weird.
What happened?
Oh! Sorry about that. You OK?
  You?   Oh, no.
  You!   I'm real sorry about your wedding.
I'm gonna kill you and your little pig!
Got to go.
That way. That way!
  That's my cart!   Move! Move!
I can see the campus right over there!
Ten minutes to spare. Ain't no stopping us now.
Dad!
Surprise!
Are you out of your mind?
(LAUGHS) Hand me the four iron, Mel.
Take the wheel.
How we looking?
Looking good!
HORN HONKS Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Aah! Ooh!
Aah! Aah!
Is this part of the initiation?
Get out of the way!
Aah!
Come on.
We got one minute to go.
Go, Mel. Go, Mel! Go, Mel!
Daddy, elevator!
Wrong door!
Now, go! Go! Go, move!
Aah! Ohh!
I got it. Sorry.
I'm so very sorry about that one.
Daddy, get it off of me!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ohh! Ohh!
Hi. My name is Melanie Porter.
I have an interview with the admissions committee.
Of course.
Porter, Porter, Port...
You made it just in time, Miss Porter.
They're all waiting for you right in there.
Yes! Yes!
How do I look?
Like an angel.
Aw, thanks, Dad.
All right.
That was horrible.
Aren't you going in?
Next, please.
Mel, what?
I'm afraid.
Well, guess what.
I was afraid, too.
Dad, what are you afraid of?
I was afraid that if I let you go
that you'd never need your Daddy again.
But I'm always gonna need you.
Mel, this is what you gotta do.
Go in there with all confidence,
keep your head up, and do your best.
All you can do is win.
Yeah. I like that.
And if they don't accept you after that,
it's their loss.
I'm so glad you're my Dad.
Time for you to shine, baby.
I'm gonna let you go now.
Time to go.
Let's go, Trey.
Melanie Porter.
Porter. Here we go. Room 217.
I just checked in your neighbour.
You did, really? Who is it?
  Aah!   Aah!
I don't believe it! Can you believe it?
I'm room 218!
I don't believe it!
Oh, my gosh!
You inspired me to apply here,
and now we're gonna be neighbours!
Ohh!
I have to go get my Dad! He'll be so excited to see you.
Dad?
Surprise! Ha ha ha! Mwah!
James! How are you?
It's so good to see you.
Oh, this is my wife Sugarplum.
Hi.
My sugarplum, Michelle.
Hello, Michelle. It's so nice to meet you.
Hello, Michelle.
Hi.
So, our daughters are staying in the same dorm.
How crazy is that?
You know what I'm thinking?
Booster club karaoke party!
  Ohh!   Ohh!
A little more singing.
A little more singing.
Absolutely! Ha ha!
  Come on, Poopsie.   OK.
Ha ha ha!
Hey!
People
People who need people
Are the lu...
I swallowed a bug.
Wait for me!
I can't help it. I like that guy.
Our baby.
This is it.
Come here, baby.
I never thought this day would come.
I did, but I'm proud of you.
Oh, thank you, Daddy.
I love you.
I love you, beautiful.
I'll see you at Thanksgiving, all right?
You gonna be OK?
Where does the time go?
Yeah.
Come on, baby. Let's head home.
Trey, five minutes, dinner.
Coming, Dad!
I can't believe it's been three months already.
I just hope she hasn't changed too much.
Well, how changed could she be? You talk to her every week.
Where did Albert get that hat?
Over the river and through the woods
To the Porters' house we go. Ha ha ha!
I love this guy! Oh, what a gas!
Come on, James. The karaoke's all set up.
We're gonna sing, dance.
No, no. Maybe after we eat.
We don't want to start singing without the girls.
  OK. All right.   That was Melanie and Wendy.
They're two minutes away. I can't wait to meet Tracy.
Tracy? Yeah. That's a friend of hers from school.
They're gonna be studying in Japan together next semester.
Now, James. You promised me you're not gonna make a big fuss about Japan.
No. This is the new James Porter,
new and improved. There's nothing I can't handle.
I'm cool.
  We're here!   We're here!
Mel Bear!
Hey! All right!
Wendy Poo!
Look at you!
Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Tracy.
Uh oh.
Uhh...
Nice to meet you, Mr Porter, Mrs Porter.
  Mmm mmm.   Mmm mmm.
Tracy.
  You're a guy.   Mm hmm.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a guy.
"Nice to met you." Yeah?
Nice to mee...
Nice to meet you, Tracy.
There you go.
Thanks. Thank you, Sir.
James, I am so proud of you. It takes a good dad to accept anything.
I'm so happy you just said that!
Scooter!
Ding dong.
Dad, everyone, this is Scooter,
and Scooter and I are getting married!
Dad! (WHIMPERS)
Getting to know you
Getting to know all...
Aah!
Aah!
Ooh, and it's all right
And it's coming along
We got to get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We got to get right back
To where we started from
Uh huh...
Do you remember that day
That shiny day
When you first came my way?
I said no one could take your place
And if you get hurt
If you get hurt
By the little things I say
I can put that smile back on your face
Ooh, and it's all right
And it's coming along
We got to get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We got to get right back to where we started from
It's all right
And it's coming along
We got to get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We got to get right back
To where we started from
All right, it's coming along
We got to get...
