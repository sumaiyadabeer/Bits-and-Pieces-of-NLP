Good afternoon and welcome to the Daily Politics. A are we being too
soft or too hard on the banks? News that another boss has backed
another multi million pound bonus. Bob Diamond of Barclays is a happy
bunny, £6.5 million richer than he was yesterday.
They HSBC are threatening to move to hang Kong.
She did he stay or should he go? If Prince Andrew goes, there could be
trouble. If he stays, it could be Ball of that coming up. With us for
the duration today, all for Douglas Murray, the director of the Centre
really going so well for the rebels now. No, this morning, troops loyal
to Colonel Gaddafi appear to be pushing back the opposition in
Further east, residents have reported that many are leaving the
town of Ras Lanuf. Against that backdrop, and also the
picture are we seeing unfold? Let's start off with, is Gaddafi winning?
It is too early to tell. The signs are that he is going to hold on as
long as he can. He has said so. This is the beginning I think of a
really protracted battle. This country and other countries have a
big problem here, which is, who, then, in the meantime, you speak to.
This effort to go in and try to find someone to speak to has ended
in ignominy. What a extraordinary event. I will just read you the
response, from Number Ten   when we seeking to establish contact with
opposition figures. We will continue to do so. We will not be
drawn into operational aspects, but the operation was done in the
normal way, that is, the Foreign Secretary taking the decision and
discussing with the Prime Minister. It is our intention to send in a
further team in due course to better understand the position on
the ground. Why send them in in the dead of night and then get
summarily turfed out? And also, in recent days, William Hague and
others have been keen to stress that Britain is getting involved,
and are not just sitting on the sidelines. One problem often for
new Government's is what they do with their toys. And the Tory that
governments like talking about most is Special Forces. You never see a
bigger decline    a bigger gleam in the eye of Cabinet ministers them
when they can talk about the SAS. But this one has ended very badly.
It begs the question, whose hand is on the tiller? I have to say, this
is one of the signs of Britain's new role in the world. We cut our
defence forces, we can barely evacuate our own people from Libya,
and then we think that we have some huge role in the future of the
region. We're playing a game that we're no longer equipped to play.
turned up on the dock at Benghazi and said, take me to your leader.
It is time for us to progress to our daily quiz. The question for
today is are all about the American actor, and well known hell raiser,
Charlie Sheen. The question today   which British dignitary does
Charlie Sheen apparently want to Prince Andrew, Boris Johnson,
Charles Kennedy, or Harriet Harman? I think we know which one it is
not! Douglas will give us the correct answer at the end of the
show. Please e mail in any comments. We will read out some of your
thoughts later on in the programme. Do any of them want to hang out
with him? I would not. Would you? Definitely not. I saw the interview
with Piers Morgan. It is Monday. If you had a good weekend, you
probably lied about it. Did you see that? People like about it. I had a
good weekend and I am not lying. Bankers are back in the news. Bob
Diamond, chief executive of Barclays, the one we love to hate
because he makes lots of money, has received a bonus of £6.5 million
for 2010. That brings his total remuneration for the year to around
£10 million. Not bad. We have also learnt that HSBC are considering
upping sticks and heading East, to escape Britain. And Liberal
Democrat MP wants the Government to give away billions of Pounds of
shares to the likes of you and me. Why not? That's what I say. Mark
Field joins us. Tell us what it is you would like the Government to do
with the shares in RBS and Lloyds that we currently owned a majority
of? We currently owned these shares on our behalf by the Treasury. We
spend billions of pounds acquiring them in 2008. We know that when the
market price recovers and the bank's return to creditability,
they will offload them again. I think that will be a shame. The
usual people that can buy shares will go out and buy them. They
could even be sovereign well. What I am proposing today is that
instead those shares are given to 45 million UK adults, everyone on
the parliamentary electoral register, as the best way of
selecting who those people are. They can hold the shares, enjoy the
capital growth above that point. If they sell the shares, they will
have to give back what it cost the Treasury what it cost to acquire
them in the first place. If they hold on for a long time, the
Government gets no money. That is true. This is a Government that is
Max doubt with a deficit. They are probably secretly fax    factoring
in that money. Not that the moment. By said secretly. We are proposing
a three stage disposal. There will be a bond that realises £15 million.
Then the shares can be distributed to the public and as they sell the
shares over time, or are sold on their behalf as we propose, the
Treasury would get the money back. So you could not hold on to them if
you wanted to? There will be a choice. You can opt out of the
automatic trading, or hold on to them. When you come to sell, the
Treasury would get back the acquisition costs. The taxpayer
gets the money back, but citizens get the money back as well. What is
wrong with that? It is the back of a fag packet nonsense. I don't like
it. I thought to believe in people's capitalism. I do but I
believe more than anything else that we need to have a competitive
banking system that links in to HSBC, which she will ask me about
later, I expect. It is of crucial importance that we maximise
whatever the amount paid back will be when we sell our shares in
Lloyds. We only these banks    we own these bangs with the Government
taking a stake in them on our behalf. We owns them before, too,
in the form of institutions. Our pension funds were in the banks.
Institutional investment. What is wrong with us just owning them
directly? Institutions are notoriously useless at enforcing
shareholder desire. Governments don't really represent us in
ownership. Why shouldn't we end them directly? These are global
banking players. We want them to invest and develop their business
over the next 10 years. I think we might be holding on to parts of our
holdings in Lloyd's and RBS for that length of time and we will
need to. I want to move on to HSBC. I can assure market is not dreamt
up on the back of a fag packet.    Mark. It is carefully considered by
a reputable think tank. I have taken advice from a City hedge fund.
It has been thought about in great depth over three months. The bigger
issue that is at stake is we do not want to hamstring these banks. We
have bigger players in Barclays and HSBC as well. They will not be
subject to these restrictions. is certainly worth debating.
Whether it will ever happen, my guess is the Government just wants
the money back as quickly as it can. Probably this side of the election.
Let's move on. HSBC. How seriously do you take these stories that HSBC
might head for Hong Kong? You are right to say might. They have a
three year review. One has the sense we are being softened up a
bit by HSBC. They are allowing it to be said they are more interested
in going down this route. It is a worry, and partly a worry that we
are not quite as open for business as the Government is supporting
itself to be. We talk about being open for business, which is an
important part of the economic recovery, but if you look at the
amount of new regulation in recent months, with the bribery Act coming
into play, with more employment legislation in place, the banking
levy, I can understand the point of view of HSBC. They want to hedge
their bets. London will be important in the future but they
want to do things in the East as well. It is difficult for the
Government because HSBC does not make that much money in this
country. Like retail banking organisations everywhere, they are
not efficient and return on capital is small. It makes a fortune
elsewhere. Why stay in Britain to log these profits in Britain which
don't come from Britain, when they could lock them in Hong Kong and
not pay much tax? That is where they were originally based and
presumably they came to London for a variety of factors. After they
bought the profitable part of their organisation. I think sometimes you
have to take these veiled threats with a pinch of salt. I think there
is much more to living and operating in London than just the
tax and regulatory regime. People love living in London, it is a
world city, the world comes to London. If you want to relocate to
Geneva, the quality of life and what you experience... Geneva is
quite nice. Not in the summer. does the best in HSBC stand for?
The worry is that banks and hedge funds and things outside the
financial sector to are looking across the globe and thinking
London is not so good a place to be their bets by having more people in
Geneva and Hong Kong. I look at Shanghai, I look at India, huge
markets for the future. The worry in the City is not that it will
disappear tomorrow, but that in 20 or 30 years' time it will not be as
competitive a global market and we have to get the decisions right now.
It will be a huge bloated reputation of the coalition if HSBC
even moved part of its operation.     huge blow to the reputation of
the coalition. I agree. These reports have to be taken with a
pinch of salt. One of the Sunday newspapers spoke to a sauce that
said it was more likely than not that they would leave and so on.
The Government has to weigh up the fact that HSBC need some assurances
at the same time as not completely caving in to threats like this.
Thank you for joining us. Are we doing Prince Andrew now? We are not.
Hold fire. I am going to talk about something that David Cameron thinks
has failed. Nick Clegg thinks it is very important. Am not talking
about a fee, but the case for multiculturalism.    I am not
David Cameron says that multiculturalism has failed. I
would go further than that. I would say it has been the most pernicious,
divisive policy pursued by Western governments since World War II. It
is a deeply misunderstood idea. Multiculturalism is not the seen as
more tick racialism, or pluralism, but nevertheless, for years,
anybody who has criticised multiculturalism has been described
as a racist. State sponsored multiculturalism judges that the
state and should not impose valued or expectations on immigrants  
rather, it should bend over backwards to accommodate the
demands of immigrants. The multicultural era would have
continued a lot longer if it had not been for radical Islam. The
fact is that Western societies have now nurtured more than one
generation of immigrants who not only appear to feel no loyalty to
the country they're in, but actively in some cases seem to
despise it. The question now is, what can be done about it? I
believe that from school age upwards, we have to reassert a
common British narrative, a core culture. But the Muslim communities
that David Cameron talked about will not reform themselves. The
Government is going to have to shut down and prosecute any
organisations, including charities, which are linked to extremism and
terrorism. Preachers and those who come from abroad to preach hatred
and division should be prosecuted and deported. So, will Mr Cameron
be able to do any of this? Well, his talk of a new, muscular
liberalism is to be welcomed. But there are reasons to be sceptical.
In 2005, after the London bombings, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair
said that the rules of the game were going to change. The thing is,
The author of that little narrative, Douglas, who are still with us, and
we have been joined by the political editor of the New
Statesman, Mehdi Hasan. You two have crossed swords on this one.
Douglas says, multiculturalism means that if you're a white person,
born into a white family, the state would protect you, but if you had
the misfortune to be born into an Asian background, the state would
look the other way. Is he not allowed to say those things?
course he is, who said he wasn't? There is a lot of straw men in this
debate. I'm in the minority here, in a different sense. Because the
dominant thesis now is anti  multiculturalism. What I would say
on that specific issue, for example, forced marriages, is that it is
just not true, the state does not look the other way. The Foreign
Office has a unit which goes out to Pakistan to rescue British girls.
And nobody defends forced marriages on multicultural grounds. And this
is an accusation levelled at many of those who argue from your
standpoint, that you paint them with far too broad a brush. You
talk about immigrants despising the country they live in   how many
immigrants do that? It does not have to be a very large percentage
for them to cause problems. First of all, I'm saying, people who come
to this country, who are then taught a sense of hatred towards
this country. What we're seen in Britain is a form of reverse
assimilation. People are less integrated this generation than
their parents and grandparents, because there is less desire to
actually get involved in the country. Another thing, this is not
a straw man argument about the forced marriages. It is true, the
Fordham, of office has now got a forced marriage unit, but it was
very late in coming. The phenomenon of girls of Asian background being
married off had been going on for decades. Nobody has denied that,
but it was not going on because of multiculturalism, that's the point.
It is wrong to say that the younger generations are not as integrated.
You have said yourself that it alienates particularly the British
Muslim community, when people paint with such broad brushstrokes, and
you talk about the alienation, yet when he talks about it, you say it
is not true. I'm talking about the alienation which we're causing
right now, I'm not talking about the last 40 years. Where are we now
let me just take a poll, in 2009, there was an extensive poll of
Muslim communities across Europe, and they found that British Muslims
were more likely to identify with Britain than with non Muslim
Britons. There were also more keen on living in mixed areas than
segregated areas. So I do not buy this caricature, from the right,
which says, all young Muslims are out to blow stuff up. Not me or any
of my friends. Andrew, you were describing the bombers as
immigrants, at what point do they cease to be immigrants, and become,
in your mind, nationals, or British, or part of the landscape? There is
a friend of mine who immigrated here himself, and he says, the
point when you become British is the point when you realise you do
not get any extra rights than anyone else, any extra
sensitivities than anyone else, any extra sensitivity. All you get is
to put up with the same crap that the rest of us get to put up with,
no extra things. And the thing is that at the moment, the dominant
narrative of British life has become lost. This is what I was
trying to say in the film. Everyone can argue their rights, their
background, their culture, other than British rights, British
culture. I think it makes it a lot easier to integrate people if you
know what you're integrating into. British culture, and minority
rights, it is all one and the same thing. Culture evolves, Britishness
evolves. I'm very keen to unpick some of this. At the last election,
even the Labour Party said, we made white working class people feel
alienated, we herded them into the hands of extremists. We know that
the Labour Party have been wrong on a lot of things. One of the people
who was saying that was disqualified from his seat in
Oldham. I'm not going to take lessons from Phil Woolas. But you
think that message was wrong? think there is an issue with
working class communities, white working class communities, but I
think that's an economic issue. To pretend it is about language or
forced marriages is rubbish. On the terrace and point, Surrey, the 7/7
bombers could speak English, married of their own accord, played
cricket, they were not enforced marriages. This is the tragedy,
that there are people in this country who do not feel they have
to have any loyalty to this country. And we saw there one of the end
points it can lead to. They spoke Now, he should be an advert for the
"big society", but the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, has said it
is down to Prince Andrew to judge if he should continue in his
voluntary role as ambassador for Britain. So what is all the fuss
about? Anita has more. Yes, the question is, how shiny and blemish 
free should our trade envoy's reputation be? The recent
controversy surrounding Prince Andrew's suitability for the row
centres on his friendship with the billionaire and convicted
paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. It has emerged that Prince Andrew has also
met the chickened that Jeffrey Epstein was convicted of under age
sex with, and also that he has paid some money to the Duchess of York's
personal assistant. The Prince has also been criticised for his lack
of judgment. Entertaining the summer law of the ousted Tunisian
President, and also criticised    son in law    for his alleged, and
they are alleged, attempts to save Gaddafi. He has been labelled as
rude and cocky by a US Ambassador. Now, Downing Street will apparently
shed no tears if the Duke of York were to resign as Trade envoy. It
does not exactly look like business is booming for Prince Andrew.
Downing Street seems to have changed its tune a little bit this
morning. We are joined now by the London Bureau Chief of TIME
Magazine, Catherine Mayer, who travelled with Prince Andrew in
2004. We have got a man who has a close association with a paedophile,
who tried to groom under aged girls, and turn them into buzz to judge.
Among his friends are a Libyan gun runner, and a Tunisian, isn't it?
Described by the Foreign Office as the biggest criminal of the Mall.
He sells his house to the relative of a Kazakhstan dictator at a price
above the market value. Where is the good news? There was that quote
about the only bad publicity being in your obituary. And I suspect
that the papers have now written prince under's obituary as the
trade envoy. But what I saw on the trip to China with him is something
that also came through in the WikiLeaks cable, the US diplomat
who wrote the cable complained about his boyishness. I've seen
that, I'm not at all surprised by that. However, I also saw what she
described, which was the British businessmen roaring their approval
of Andrew. Of the fact that he's boorish and arrogant and doesn't
think the Americans understand geography? No, boorishness, what it
really is, is that the Royals occupy a parallel universe. I'm not
quite sure what the case is. case is, I have to say, I'm not
here to make... I need to hear the case against. I'm not making the
case for, the point that I would like to make very clearly is that
the fuss about Prince Andrew is taking away from the real
culpability. You have to look at the wider context he was operating
That doesn't mean he has to be boorish or arrogant. But he was
terribly effective. He does the job for free, he opens doors that might
not be opened otherwise, he's good for British business. He has done
the job for a number of years, but once you become the story, and he
becomes an embarrassment to the royal family, then frankly, it is
time for him to go. We cannot be in a position where somebody who is
not accountable, and we cannot ask questions about him in parliament,
else who was an elected person, or a member of the House of Lords, who
was accountable, and once that is not possible, then it becomes
impossible for him to stay in the job. Members of the House of Lords
are 10 a penny, and they will probably want to be paid. Can't he
opened doors for people which otherwise...? I have seen him
handing a meeting of dignitaries from the United Arab Emirates, and
he seemed to do it rather well. That world is changing, because of
the revolutions. We are in a situation where the Prime Minister
went to Kuwait, he did not have to take Prince Andrew with him. I
think he should go. He's an embarrassment to the royal family,
it damages the royal family. Alan Bennett said in his play on George
III, that he had someone saying, to be the Prince of Wales is not a
position, it is a predicament. And the Duke of York is no different.
It is a terrible position of trying to find their way in the world, and
unfortunately, as in this case, continually coming against the
ordinary riggers and analyses... Nobody forces them to have dealings
also part of politics. Just time to find out the answer to our quiz.
Which British bigotry does Charlie Sheen want to hang out with? It is
not Prince Andrew, or me, or Harriet Harman. Of course, it is
