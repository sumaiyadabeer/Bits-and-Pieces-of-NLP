Guess with Jess
Guess with Jess today!
Whoa! Ha ha! Hello!
Brr! It's so windy.
And c c cold!
Can't you stay in the farm, Jess? It's nice and warm.
But, Billy, we have to be outside today.
Yes! Because it's Willow's apple picking party. Yay!
Whoa! OK, Baa! Stop, Baa!
Sorry.Ha ha ha.
Can you guess where we'll have the party?
Yes! In the orchard, where the apples grow.
Let's go and collect Mimi on our way.
Brr. I wonder if she's remembered the party.
Mimi! BELL RINGS
Ooh. It is so c c cold!
It's party day!
SHE GASPS Willow's apple picking party.
Yes! And we're going to play "Willow Says" like we always do.
But it's too c c cold for me.
I don't want to go, Jess.
Oh! Please, Mimi!
Well, I'll go if you find a way to k k keep warm.
So how can we all keep warm at Willow's party?
Hey! That's the big question!
Who?Ask a lot of...What?
Aska lot of...Where?
Ask a lot of...Why?
Ask a lot of... Ask it, test is, find a way
Guess with Jess, come on let's play
What's the question here today?
How can we all keep warm at Willow's party?Hooray!
Willow's party is today? But I'm f f freezing!
We're all f f freezing.
Except me. I'm not a bit cold!
Hee hee. That's because you're covered in wool!
Baa's wool isn't the only thing keeping him warm.
It's not? What else, then?
Heat leaves your body through the top of your head.
Hm. Let's think.
If heat leaves your body through the top of your head,
what should you wear to keep the heat in?
A scarf...
a woolly hat...
or a coat?
A woolly hat! Well done.
Oh, can I borrow it, Baa? Please?
Well...OK.
Can I have a turn?Of course.
Er...
Brilliant.
It's very warm in here.
The thing is, there's only one woolly hat
and we all need a hat to keep warm.
I think I might go inside and keep myself warm.
Can we come?Of course you can. Brr.
We must answer the big question,
or there won't be a party.
We'll check the farmyard for clues.
Good thinking!Party!
Hm. I wonder how my friend, Horace, is keeping warm today.
Let's go to the pond and look for clues.
Brr! It's freezing!
Where's Horace? Can you help me call him?
Horace!
Hey, Jess! You called me?
Hee hee! Horace! You're all muddy!
Course I am. It's how a frog stays warm when it's cold.
You just bury yourself in mud. It's like a big sloppy blanket.
Wow! Frogs are SO clever!
That's given me an idea! Stay warm, Horace!
Come with me!
Bye, Jess!
Hey! I know how we can all keep warm at the party!
Hooray!What is it? What do we have to do?
We cover ourselves in something. Ofcourse!Brilliant!
Cover ourselves? In what?
Ooh. Can you remember what Horace was covered in to stay warm?
In cotton wool...
in mud...
or in leaves?
In mud!Yes! Yes!
In mud? Mud?
Look out!
We love mud! Whoo hoo!Amazing!
Jess, I'm a clean, pink rabbit. I'm not covering myself in mud.
Come on, Mimi. I'll do it with you. Then we can go to the party.
You're both feeling warmer, aren't you?
No.No.Not really, Jess.
Hey!
Hm. Maybe the muddy blanket only works for frogs.Oh, phew!
Party! >
Party! Is it time? It is really time?
Not yet. We still don't know how to keep warm at the party, Baa.
What do we have here, I wonder?
And I'm so cosy.
Hm. Straw.A ha!
Billy! I get it! You're brilliant!
There's lots of it in my barn. Come on, everyone.
Ooh. Straw's great stuff to snuggle up into to keep warm.
Warm as toast.
I'm getting warm. Yeah, straw's great!
Boo!Ahh!
We might be warm now,
but if we want to play "Willow Says" in the orchard,
we can't bury ourselves in straw.
But we might be able to do something else with straw.
Huh?
I've got an idea.
Willow!Willow, we're here!Hello, everyone!Hello, Willow.
Here we are!
Willow, look!Ready for the party!
We're wearing straw to keep warm. WIND BLOWS
Brr!
Ha ha. THAT wasn't meant to happen.
You poor things! You all look so cold.
Let's start playing "Willow Says".
But, Willow, we're still so chilly!
Come on, everyone. Give it a try.
Willow says...
run to the nearest apple,
kick it around a tree
and back to your place. Go!
Willow says...
run in and out of the apples.
Willow says...
stop!
Hee hee. That was great, Willow.
And...ooh. Wait a minute.
I'm toasty warm!
So am I!
Me, too. I'm really warm!
That's because you were running about.
Hm. How does that make you warm?
Running makes you all warm on the inside...
And that makes you warm on the outside.
And that's what we are   toasty warm!
We've got the answer! Yippety yay! Yippety yay! Yippety yay!
Hooray!
Hey hey
Yippity yay
We've found the answer with Jess today
We followed the clues
We put it to the test
We tried our best And then we've guessed
Singing hey hey
Yippity yay
Here's the answer
Shout hooray!
We kept warm at Willow's apple picking party
Hooray!
Oh, Baa, you look really hot.
Ha ha! Maybe you could play "Willow Says" with your friends.
It's brilliant fun.
Come and help me answer another question soon! Bye!
