review the schools opening next Tonight: Scotland and Europe are in
negotiations. The arguments continue. You could be forgiven to
think this is like a long running pantomime. We ask why the statement
Scotland holds its first annual awards dinner. Should tonight's
event be its valedictory bash? Good evening. It has turned out to be
one of the surprise hits of 2012, how an independent Scotland would
negotiate membership of the European Union. And there are lots
of good plot lines, too. The break up of the United Kingdom. High 
finance. Oil. International politics. But when the final
chapter is eventually written, the SNP says common sense, realism and
mutual consent will win the day. All in all, it could make for a
decent political thriller. But, after the spats of this week,
Barroso, maybe it has come to feel a bit like of a seasonal pantomime.
Laura Bicker compiled this report. Hello, boys and girls! So, boys and
girls of Scotland, what have we learned over the last week about an
independent Scotland and the EU? We certainly are not living happily
ever after. It has been a bit of a song and a dance. First of all,
this come up on the front page of the Scotsman. It's good Scotland
would have to reapply to become a member of the EU. It is of interest
for the people of Scotland to find it where it came from. There were
anti  independence people. Was the commission at fault? We know that
story is not correct. Then there was the European Commission
President himself, who said in newly independent Scotland would
have to reapply to join the EU. the country becomes independent, it
is a new state and has to prove    has to negotiate. You are saying,
we will still be able to keep being members. Is there really a position
that can be sustained for a single second? To you disagree with the
4th paragraph of the better?    do you disagree? If it were to become
a newly independent state, of the treaties with no longer apply.
is the point where pink is the nub of this letter from the President
of the UK Commission.    that I think. It is where, I think, there
is no foundation entreaty for that position to be supported.   
Foundation treaty. Today it was time for the SNP fairy godmother to
take to her feet. The UK Commission is not the final arbiter of these
matters.    the EU Commission. It does not constitute the ruling. Nor
does it claimed to be addressing the particular situation of
Scotland. We are an integral member of the EU. It is not credible to
review that the other nations of the European Union would not want
to retain access to the vast array of resources and opportunities that
Scotland brings to the EU table. Star Dale, the questions kept
coming.    still, the questions kept coming. Does she know if she
will be granted a meeting? What questions will she asked? Wills
should just tell him how it will be?    she asked him? Will she just
tell him? The Scottish Government says the law is on his side. The
opposition says this is fantasy. At least this Holyrood battle has not
yet come to fisticuffs, unlike in the Ukraine parliament. Not the
tame in sight. Good heavens!    not a Dame. Well, we asked Nicola
Sturgeon on to the programme tonight but she declined. But we
are joined in Glasgow by the SNP's Stewart Maxwell and, from Edinburgh,
by Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. You
have got the statement from Nicola Sturgeon. Is a a whole thing laid
to rest? It has been shambolic from start to finish. They said they had
legal advice and now we discover they did not. It does not matter.
They also said that Scotland would not have to negotiate in the early
stages. Now they say they do. It has been a shambles. That is a
rapid history of your take on the affair. Given there appears to be a
statement saying there has to be negotiations, there is nothing in
that you could disagree with, is there? There is no rust to go. We
would have to be in the European Union.    nowhere else to go.
will come on to that. Why did you not just...? If the truth is there
would have to the negotiations, it means it could end in failure. You
accept there have to the negotiations. Nicola Sturgeon says
there is a realistic prospect of them staying in the EU. Why did you
not say that in the first place? have always said that. By the stuff
about Scotland automatically remaining a member of the EU?   
why the stuff? It is not about whether Scotland would be in or out
of the you but the negotiated settlement for its membership.
the EU. It is not a negotiation about where this cover up begin are
out of the EU, it is about how many members we have.    whether
Scotland will be in or out of the EU. If there were negotiations and
the EU insisted that Scotland should join the euro or the
agreement which is a central pillar of European Union membership and
the Scottish Government refused, are you saying it would still be a
member of the European Union and the countries that demanded these
things would have to part cough? That is not the interpretation at
all.    back off. We would be negotiating these arrangements from
inside the European Union. That is very different. He is not talking
about the situation appertaining to Scotland. In terms of the euro,
there is no way to force the country to join the euro. That is
wrong. That is not true. Ireland and the UK currently have an
arrangement outside the Schengen Agreement. Realistically there
would have to be negotiation. The fundamental point is, there is no
obvious reason why any countries in the European Union should want to
make life... No reason why the EU as a whole should want to make it
difficult for Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon was right in one thing
today if stop it is not just about the legal issues. It is about
politics.    one thing today. They are always keen to get something
for their country. You can just imagine the circumstances where
they are negotiating for Scotland to cumin. It has no choice to go
anywhere else.    come in. There would be all sorts of concessions
against Scotland. That would be a poor handful Scotland. I take you
do not accept this idea that some has got and what remained almost
permanently a member of the European Union, even though it had
to negotiate to be in it.    that Scotland. You presumably would not
accept that? It is about membership terms in the European Union.
Stewart says they are a continuing member. You would have to negotiate.
I cannot see are circumstances where they were not in the European
Union.    the circumstances. There are financial restraints which
countries like Sweden have to comply with. Scotland has 1% of the
total population of the European Union and that is not a strong hand.
Presumably with things like the UK rebate, you would not be demanding
that. The Budget would have to be negotiated. We have accepted that.
You would not seek a specific rebate. We would negotiate the
contribution of Scotland. That is another reason why Scotland would
not be thrown out of the European Union. No one is saying we're going
to be thrown out. The issue is about strength of hand. Part of
your problem in theirs is that you changed your position on the euro.
It used to be Scotland joining the euro. Why not do that? We talked
about joining the euro when it was the appropriate time. Why not just
join it? No sensible person would say this was the appropriate time
to join the euro. That is daft. Look at the financial situation in
the eurozone. If you go into a currency union with the UK,
Scotland would have no say it on Web, or if, it joined the euro.
would have a say in it. A country has to be in the ERM for several
years. It is up to the UK government to decide that. You have
to be a member of the ERM for several years. Joining the euro is
entirely voluntary. We would not be joining the euro. No party in the
UK wants to join the euro. I mean, how could you ever do that?
country can change its position. Are you seriously saying that?
would be in the sterling Zen and that is the position for the
foreseeable future. Scotland has most of the gas and 60% of the
territorial waters. The idea that Scotland has a weak hand is
ludicrous. We have no around us to go. Hang on a second. What is the
Liberal Democrat position on joining the euro? When know you do
not want Scotland to be independent. If it does come up with the Liberal
Democrats in Scotland say, let's just join up? We do not want to be
forced to make the choice between the euro and the pound run by a
foreign government. We do not want to go down that route. Let's say
you lose. You're not going to disappear, are you? The Liberal
Democrats will not say, we lost the referendum. We are constructive. We
want to try to make the best of a bad job and there difficult
circumstances we are in. We would have to work with the United
Kingdom to try to form alliances. So, you support the currency union?
We are against it. We would work constructively. I understand that
you do not want a yes vote. You are saying, if there is a yes vote, you
actually would support the views of Stuart Maxwell and what we should
do with the currency? I am saying I did not want that position but if
we are there, we will make the best of a bad job. We will work with our
partners. He is mad if he thinks that is a good idea. This stuff
about gas and oil. We know it has lots of gas and oil but it does not
want to be in the EU. That is the decision of Norway. Those up only
one of the things that Scotland brings to the table. Renewable
energy resources of the potential we have and the fishing waters. The
idea that the European Union would throw out a country that contain so
much of the rich fishing grounds of states such as Spain... I thought
you were in favour of it? common fisheries policy... All of
these things... I Am curious. You have had long standing problems.
Would you demand changes as a condition of signing up to the
European Union? It is about negotiate with friends and partners
in Europe. There needs to be a red line. There is a red line. We think
the Scottish referendum would benefit from this    at the Common
Fisheries Policy and the wit    the rich resources we have in our
You can't beat a good awards ceremony. The glitz, the glamour,
the recognition for a job well done. That's what the funding body
Creative Scotland had in mind when it teamed up with the Daily Record
to launch a new awards ceremony. The film The Angel's Share, the
Glasgow Film Festival and the band Manran were among the nominees at
the event in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum tonight. But many others are
staying away, angry at the cost, the timing and the all male jury.
Our arts correspondent Pauline McLean reports.
The final preparations for their newest award ceremony in Scotland.
The awards created by a creative Scotland celebrate the cultural
scheme with Manny performers provided the entertainment. We want
to raise the profile of arts and culture in a broader audience. It
is about depreciation, awareness and hopefully participation. The
awards are the culmination of a campaign run with the Daily Record
and through the Metro, to encourage people to nominate you they feel
have been created people across a variety of art forms. But it has
not turned out like that. There are �30,000 cost of a bone of
contention, and the ticket price beyond most working hard as, and
then be decision to select an all  male jury. Any public row of about
the way that it is run and the resignation of the chief executive,
and at the very least, celebration seems premature. Some of the
artists can still consider protesting, and some say it should
not stop it has been ill conceived end mismanaged from the website
with lots of spelling mistakes, from people's names spelt wrong to
the ludicrous names of some other categories. Also, their piece de
resistance of having an all male judging panel, it was a disaster
from start to finish. It is a private function that is costing
�100 a ticket. There is so much to be celebrated Tendayi seemed to be
wanting to make the arts corporates.    and they seem to be wanting. It
has been the kind of language that has been used, it was market driven,
and that is what the real problem is. It is about the war roads and
these are trivial aspect of it.    the awards. There has been a
campaign started up on Facebook, it is when they announced that it was
going to be an all male jury, I mean what a howler! C above the
nominees have deliberately stayed away, but some say that the awards
are important. We have all worked very hard at what we're doing and
it is nice to bring harrowed little team together and show them
appreciation.    bring a Rome team together. It is a nice experience
and it is the opportunity to meet other artists working in other
genres. I am at the thought to that. The awards are part of a year of
creative Scotland, a Government campaign to celebrate culture. They
promote tourism ahead of the arts, but they want to change that.
is about promoting artists and performers. It is important to do
this and it is important to take the successful work of our artists
and share it with a wider audience. But everyone knows about all of our
success stories and we need to introduce their work to a wider
audience. That is why this event with the Daily Record and a
national newspaper will introduce some artists to a wider audience.
We should celebrate success, we have a lot to be proud of, but it
is not about an hour organisation, about creative Scotland, it has got
to be about the artists. I welcome the intimation that this is the way
the organisation wants to go. used towards her genuinely divided
the artistic community with some going home winners and others
staying away. Although the planned protest didn't come to anything, if
it is not a way. They are giving the board the time it requested to
lug out what is wrong with the organisation had put it right.
And Pauline McLean's back from those awards at Kelvingrove in
Glasgow and joins me now in the studio. What was the protest about?
There was a vociferous Facebook campaign since they were first
announced. There has been a lot of help the discussion about it with
talk initially of a flash pop or possibly an alternative award
ceremony taking place. To make the point in the piece about this
notion of an all male jury, they tackled that themselves when they
realise they had made a mistake with that. They apologised red hat
collection boxes this evening for Women's Aid, so it they recognised
that they had made a mistake and they were collecting for Women's
Aid. The board asks for more time to look at what they need to do. A
lot of the artists are respecting that. The board said, give us time
to sort this out, so rather than protest, they are waiting for the
board to report back and tomorrow they will come back with the
reports into the structure and what needs to change and also an update
on where they are with their action plan that they announced last week.
That is where we are. It seems, Brad sounding naive, it seems
extraordinary having an all male jury. It is extraordinary that they
would come up with an all male jury in 2012, and nobody would notice,
and that they would think it would make up for this by having a
collection for Women's Aid! This is something you would expect from a
country club rather than an arts organisation! This is the first
time they have worked with a tabloid newspaper they thought that
any other time, they would have thought this would be welcomed with
open arms by everyone, because it is very populist, this attempts to
make the arts available to everyone, who will say no to a lovely night
out at an awards ceremony, the big problem has been the timing. It
happened at any other time, off when the board had not stood up and
admitted getting it wrong and had a good address, when they did not
admit it but they indulge in an activity that they called promoted
