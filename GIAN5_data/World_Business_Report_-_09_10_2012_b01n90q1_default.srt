Now it is time to get the latest financial news.
Hello and welcome. You are watching World Business Report. The
headlines: The IMF meets in Tokyo and slashes its global growth
forecast, warning that the situation could get much worse.
A massive security operation in Athens for the visit of Angela
Merkel. I am Rico Hizon in Singapore. The
stock price of HTC plunges are due to stiff competition from Samsung
and Apple. Good to have you with us. We begin
with a stark warning from the IMF. In its latest assessment of the
global economy, it says unless Europe and the US address their
financial problems, the global economy could going to an even
is affecting investment. It has lowered its global growth forecast.
Tell us more about the concerns. The IMF sounded a cautionary note
today. The risk to the recovery has increased. That is what they are
saying. There are two reasons: In the eurozone and concerns about the
US. Many people are talking about Italy and Spain at the moment. I
had a chance to speak to the IMF's chief economist a short while ago.
He spoke to me about Spain. Policy makers have said they do not yet
been tend to ask for a bail out. That is the decision for Spain to
make. At this stage, given the interest rate, I understand. These
programme. What is the IMF saying about emerging markets?
If you look at advanced countries right now, growth forecasts are
around 1.3 %. That is a fairly low level. In emerging countries, the
picture was brighter. Growth of around 5.3 %. In China, 7.8 %
forecast for this year. That forecast was cut. It is better than
we are seeing any Burrell's. One of the concerns that was highlighted
is that when you see the risks that play, it hits emerging countries
when it comes to trade. There is a common factor which
applies to the division of growth in most emerging countries and that
is exports doing well. The striking thing is that when there is an
effect on trade, there is an effect on exports from emerging countries.
In China, from a Mathematica point of view, most what has happened can
be attributed to lower exports.    Mathematica.    mathematic.
message is, if decision makers start doing a better job, worst 
case scenarios may not become a reality. Angela Merkel is making
her first trip to Athens since the crisis started three years ago.
Many Greeks blame Germany for the austerity programmes that they are
having to suffer. Both left wing and right wing parties are
promising demonstrations. Police officers will stand by to keep
order. The Greek Prime Minister says he will receive far as the
leader of a friendly country. Age is no barrier to protest in Athens.
Yesterday, these pensioners broke through police lines to demonstrate
outside the offices of the EU. Many Greeks blame the EU for the
austerity programme which includes cuts in pensions.
They are taking our lives. They are trying to push us
off a cliff. They do not need us because we do not produce cheaply.
Given the satire reserved for Germany by the Greeks, it is clear
why Angela Merkel has not been clear to visit greasiness. The
German flag has been burned in the streets and Angela Merkel has been
characterised as a Nazi in newspapers. The message today will
be that Germany wants Greece to stay in the eurozone.
There we want to express in public in Greece a degree of recognition
for the huge amount of change that Greece has seen, at least when it
comes to wage cuts and pensions. other words, the visit is largely
symbolic. It would make no difference to a forthcoming
decision on whether Greece will get the next slice of its bailout. That
issue with Germany is still resolute.
Greece could have serious problems without the bailout. The agreement
is clear. Greece has to fulfil its commitment in order to get through
the next phase. How the meeting with Antonis
Samaras plays out back in Germany is also vital to Angela Merkel. She
faces an election next year. She has been criticised for lack of
direction on the issue of Europe. This is her chance to change that
and his chance to win a more widespread sympathy for Greece.
Thailand was my biggest maker of smart phones has seen its profits
hammered.    Thailand's biggest maker. HTC make phones for
Microsoft and giggle as well as selling phones under their own
brand name.    Google. Why have they had a tough time?
It is all because of the competition. Stiff competition,
particularly from Samsung and Apple. There is a steep decline in profit
almost 80 % from July to September compared to the same period last
year. The Galaxy has come out for Samsung, the iPhone 5 for Apple.
These factors are causing them problems. It has lost more than 50
% of its share value. HTC has a contract. Apple are selling 5
million iPhone 5s in its first week in the market. It is a strong debut.
HTC, which makes many models, is being squeezed. They do not have
the same resources to promote their handsets. It has recent strength in
China where it is the only international brand with double 
digit growth in market share. China is estimated to account for more
than 50 % of HTC shipments and sales.
The giant US aluminium maker, Alcoa reports quarterly profits later
today. Profits are expected to shrink due to weak global metal
prices. Alcoa is the first of the major US companies to report third
quarter results. Many analysts expect to see weak profits due to a
that includes British Airways and nine other carriers known as One
World. Qatar will be able to code share, which means passengers can
American Airlines says its operational performance is
improving at the recent problems. Dozens of flights had been
cancelled because of loose seats. The company has been under
bankruptcy protection since last November. They are in an ongoing
dispute with their pilots. General Motors is in the news. They have
been making headlines as well. They have got a technology centre in
Detroit. It is new. It is part of their plan to develop their own
technology after years of out to those in work. Over the next three 
five years, 10,000 staff will be hired at four centres. Markets are
myxoedema. Japan was close yesterday.    markets are mixed
