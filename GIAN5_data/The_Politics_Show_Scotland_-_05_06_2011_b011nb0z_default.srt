Justice Minister joins us live. It is the age of austerity but no
one has told the European Union apparently. Why is it still spend,
spend, spend in Brussels? We are in times of crisis and as we all know,
the auditors talk about a lot of waste and irregularity in the
Budget so I think it should be cut. On the Politics Show in Scotland:
We will be talking to the First Minister on the vexed question of
the UK Supreme Court as the expert panel to review its relationship
In these swank new surroundings, realists and even it UKIP debate

financial year, Britain gave �12.3 billion to the EU. We then got back
European Union would cost us an awful lot more if it was not for
the UK's �2.7 billion rebate. Pop the European Commission wants to
will cost us another �600 million. The way the EU budget works, we

to be paid in successive years and if we do not propose that increase,
we are in breach of legally binding contracts with a lot of people.
believe the Budget should be cut. We are in times of crisis hand as
we all know the auditors are talk about a lot of waste and
irregularity in the Budget. I think it should be cut. Also under
negotiation is the Super budget for the years 2014 up to 2020. That is
what they are talking about here. Have a majority of MEPs won the
tank the European Movement and he wants more investment in us, EU
citizens. 85% goes back to the citizens. We want the Government to
make that claim. Of the European Commission wants to freeze spending
on administration. Expenditure itself is actually reducing.
Expenditure on the rest of us is increasing. Even the European
Union's friends in Britain think the climate of austerity must lead
to cutting waste. This man defected to the Lib Dems from the
Conservatives because of Cameron's stance on the EU. There are large
areas of waste, as in any public administration, that you can cut.
You can cut out waste. I will give you an example. I am campaigning to
stop the European Parliament meeting in two places, Brussels and
Strasbourg. We talk about this every year. About �1 billion will
be spent by the European taxpayer on the European Parliament in two
places. Few would have predicted the bastion of the British do
service party would be Euro house.    Conservative Party. When you say
right in at the Conservative Party, you mean Euro sceptics. I would
argue that David Cameron, has done a disservice to the country because
rather than having friends in Brussels he now no longer has
friends in Brussels. Those of friends that we need. David Cameron
has cut himself off. In these budget negotiations, David Cameron
wants to get his way. But he does not want a big row over Europe as
well. His own MPs, many of them do want a row. They want a row which
ends with him saying up no. Welcome to the Politics Show. The
First Minister joins us and we will be talking about justice. We will
be hearing about juggernauts and also the best way to bring up
junior. A find out more after the news.
A Scots soldier killed in Afghanistan on Friday has been
named as Corporal Michael John Pike of 4th Battalion. The 26 year old
from Huntley in Aberdeenshire was married with a son and daughter.
Jules Hyam's commanding officer said he had been the epitome of a
Highland soldier, fierce, compassionate to all and
unswervingly loyal. Be a group of legal experts has
been established to examine the role of the UK Supreme Court on
Scotland's legal system. Alex Salmond set up the review after
raising his concerns about the role of the London based court.
The panel was formed after the First Minister criticised the
Supreme Court's ruling that Matt Frazer's conviction for murdering
his estranged wife was unsafe. Alex Salmond described the panel as a
stellar cast of some of the leading names in the Scottish legal system.
The chairman    the chairman will be Lord McCluskey. The other
members are or... Press of the    Professor Walker is an expert in
constitutional law their remit will be to review the jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court in human rights legislation where it relates to
Scotland and suggest possible changes. The First Minister set up
a panel because he said he wanted to defence Scotland and if
independent legal system for what he called aggressive intervention.
He was referring to the Supreme Court's ruling in Mat Fraser's
appeal. He was convicted for his wife's murder but appealed his case
arguing his right to a fair trial had been breached. The court agreed
to his appeal which angered Mr Salmond, who saw the judgment as
threatening the independence of the Scottish legal system. It is all
very well for people to criticise judges but why not criticise the
situation, which boils down to the potential replacement of Scottish
law with Lord Hope's law. I do not think that is a satisfactory
situation. A law    a row followed, the role of the Supreme Court is
related to devolution issues, which has arisen in human rights issues.
I sometimes wonder if some people have read the judgments of the
Supreme Court in these cases where people make it very clear the High
Court sitting in Scotland is the court of last resort in Scottish
criminal cases. The Scottish government's panel will bring
forward proposals to be debated at Holyrood before the summer recess.
An interview with the First Minister is coming up after this
bulletin. Police believe a fire at a homeless
charity shop in Edinburgh was started deliberately. The Bethany
premises are in the Meadows area was badly damaged in the blaze. A
woman and a child in an upstairs flat were cheated at that scene for
smoke inhalation.    were treated at the scene.
There will be patchy rain. It will be persistent on the West Coast.
The North will have dry bright weather with light winds.
Temperatures will be 13 Celsius. Tonight, there will be light rain
with heavier bursts in the far west. Shetland will be dry. Temperature
as will be eight Celsius.    An expert legal group has been set
up to review the role of the Supreme Court in Scottish criminal
cases. It is chaired by Lord McCluskey, who retired 11 years ago.
The former Solicitor General's opinion on the European Convention
of Human Rights have been controversial. He has described the
Convention rights as a field day for crackpots, are a pain in the
neck for judges and a gold mine for lawyers. A human rights based
appeal in which Lord McCluskey was one of the judges had to be re run
when the Lord    when the Lord Justice General said there was the
rest of the perception that Lord McCluskey was biased against human
rights arguments, referring to the apprehension of bias in newspaper
articles he had written, the Lord Justice General stressed the
general of the tone of the language Last week, Lord McCluskey said the
Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill ought to be ashamed of his comments
about the ignorance of English He said Lord Hope and Lord Rodger
were two of the best qualified judges in Scottish criminal law.
There has been a great deal of insulting language. I spoke to Alex
Salmond and asked him whether there was a rest of the perception Lord
McCluskey might not give the Supreme Court arguments are a fair
hearing, given his views on human rights. He is one of the finest
legal minds Scotland has produced. His character is unimpeachable. The
other members of the group are similarly stellar figures. I do not
think people are going to get very far if they try to reduce the
reputation of a group of people who would generally be regarded as a
stellar Group, a collection of four people whose views carry across a
range but each one is an expert in Scottish law. If we are talking
about the reputation of judges, can I ask you to comment on Lord
McCluskey's comments about Kenny MacAskill's response to the Supreme
Court ruling in which he said Kenny MacAskill ought to be ashamed of
his comments? If the Scottish government and I only repeated   
appointed people who agreed with us, no doubt the BBC would criticise us
for that. We appoint people to this vital group which is designed
incidentally to help a shed some light on an issue and take some of
the heat out of it because the issues involved are very important.
We need to consider some vital things they need to be understood
about the integrity of our criminal justice system. In doing that, I
can think of no better people to ask then Lord McCluskey and Sir
Gordon, who wrote the book on the judicial process in Scotland. There
is a professor of law at Edinburgh University. There is also a highly
respected author and a retired Sheriff. That is a group of people
designed to give us some light on an issue so that Parliament
candidate it and we can move forward to, protecting the
integrity of our criminal justice system. Given how important you say
this issue is, can we look at some of the rhetoric around it. We now
seem to be in a position where if you do not like a court judgment,
you personally attacked one of the judges, if your Justice Secretary's
approach to the law, whoever pays the court calls the tune, these are
deeply disturbing remarks to anybody who has no interest in the
integrity of the justice system. Whatever the merits of your
arguments, do you miss    do you regret some of the language you
use? I did not attack one of the judges. I am not aware of doing so.
You spoke about Lord Hope. A I was sporting    I was pointing out you
should not get into a position where the view of seven High Court
judges can be overturned by the rulings of one judge. That seems to
be a fair point to make. Last Tuesday, the Cabinet decided we
would go forward by appointing an expert group of people to examine
the issue in the cold of the evening and come forward with
recommendations of proposals for the Scottish Parliament to debate.
Why did we do that? We are at a time aware, for the first time in a
generation, there is a rising for public confidence in our judicial
system. The fear of crime is falling. There are police on the
streets. The clear up rate is at an eye. We are taking tens of millions
of pounds of bad people and giving it to good people across Scotland.
I do not want to see that progress sacrificed and jeopardise because
inadvertently we have created a threat to the integrity of the
justice    the criminal justice system. In order to move forward, I
have appointed people who are not yes people, who have not always
agreed with the Government, do not necessarily agree with me, but none
the less whose opinion will be respected and can give us a means
of debate and Scotland a means of moving forward. Can we be clear. Do
you support the idea of withdrawing funding from the Supreme Court?
I just point out that story, when it appeared last Wednesday, was one
week old. The newspaper held it for the journalistic reasons. I support
moving forward, having appointed a stellar group of legal group...
you support withdrawing funding? have already answered your question.
It is a legitimate question... In is a simple yes or no. Do you
support withdrawing funding from the Supreme Court or is Kenny
MacAskill wrong to say that? I have already pointed out to you that the
newspaper report was one week old and taken out of context. There is
a delay in you asking the question before I can answer. I put the
remarks in context. I am trying to say last Tuesday, the Cabinet
decided to go forward, quite deliberately, because we are trying
to find a way to improve the situation. We are trying to shed
light on this issue, not just heat. That is why I have appointed this
group of people for democratic debate. I understand the delay can
be disconcerting. But do you personally support withdrawing
funding from the Supreme Court, either permanently or as an interim
measure, until this panel makes his judgment? I am supporting going
forward. I am supporting the panel. I have already put the remarks
attributed to the Justice Secretary in the context will stop I have
told do we decided to go forward by a appointing the group. We have
four Stella legal minds. Nobody will doubt their integrity or
expertise. We will move forward on the proposals they make. That will
be debated in a democratic parliament and I hope it can be
implemented to protect the centuries old integrity of the
Scottish criminal legal system, compliant with human rights, but
having a legal system which we proudly can say serves the
interests of the people of Scotland. If we manage to do that, and undo
what is a dangerous situation that has been allowed to develop, surely
that will be more important than who said what about whom several
weeks ago. If we do look to the future, if we do not go via the
Supreme Court, given the rhetoric of the past week, should we expect
a situation where Strasbourg says, that trial was not fair. You say,
too bad, I do not agree, and it all ends up a legal limbo. What human
rights is that? There is a difference between the Strasbourg
court as it affects 47 just dictions and the Supreme Court
which seems to be appearing at the Court of Appeal.    jurisdiction's.
Made people were pessimistic about his column's chances but the
Strasbourg court upheld the jury system of Scotland which is not
like any other in Europe. It is a proper judicial democratic jury
system. It upheld victims' human rights. That was the right of rape
victims not to have their character unfairly examined. We found when we
argue that case in front of the Strasbourg court, the court found
in favour of the proper basis of the criminal law system... I am not
asking about the cases you like and approve of. I am asking about the
cases you do not like their judgment. Are we to assume, giving
Strasbourg cannot open prison doors, we go into some sort of legal limbo
or if you do not like their judgment? I only mentioned the case
because... Somewhere in your question you had the assumption
Strasbourg would find against Scots law. I think the system is well 
balanced. It should not be immune from criticism. There is a big
difference in a Strasbourg ruling   convictions are not quashed but a
legal system gets time and opportunity to reconcile its
process with the Strasbourg court. That is what applies to 47 other
jurisdictions across Europe. I believe we should have that applied
to us as well but on an equal basis with every other criminal justice
system. That is at the core of my concern about this. The core of
what the public should be concerned about his with so much improving in
the judicial system in Scotland, we do not want to create uncertainty
and lack of banality which could undermine public conference, unless
we come forward with proposals to avert that happening. Hence, the
stellar group of four experts who will help us as a country and
Parliament to do something positive and productive about it. Thank you.
A great pleasure. Joining us from our Edinburgh studio is the former
leader of the Liberal Democrats, Mingus Campbell. He is also an
advocate and a QC. Thank you for coming in. Is there to say this was
not foreseen in the incorporation of age are a through the Scotland
Act, the amount of cases that were becoming in front of the Supreme
Court? There have only been two. The first was about what happens
when a person is taken into police custody and where there when he is
in police custody, they are entitled to have the services and
advice of a solicitor. The most recent case is whether the
prosecution has a responsibility to tell the defence of all of the
evidence, even if the evidence might support the defence. Both of
these are decisions which are consistent with the principle of
fairness which lies at the very heart of the Scottish criminal to
dust    judicial system. That is why when Alex Salmond talks about
talking    creating more light, we have to question that it was he and
his justice secretary who created But there is this distinction that
if the Court of Appeal hearing Scotland's is that you cannot get
to leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, then in fact you can bypass
that in Scotland. Whereas in England, they say no week to appeal,
you cannot do that. There is a distinction already. And that is
unfair and unreasonable, is it not? Economical to the Supreme Court if
you ask for leave, and they will only grant leave their fates are
satisfied that there is at least to be determined. That is the fact
that all civil cases are capable of appeal from the Court of Session to
the Supreme Court. Civil cases raised questions of human rights. I
am aware of a case where a human right would take into account in
the case of liquor licensing. was why I asked the First Minister
about the question of funding. What do you make of the comments about
the withdrawal of funding made by the Justice Secretary? These were
petulant comments, in my view, as was the comment that the English
judges, not all English, of course, one from Northern Ireland, they all
were and what he knew about Scotland Wendy came to the
Edinburgh Festival. It has been a bad week for their Scottish
National Party government. But it has been a bad week also for the
reputation of Scotland. That is why the remarks about can he MacAskill
have received such consideration and even acceptance. Would you make
about this proposal of the majority of Scottish judges on Supreme Court
being one way forward or even the possibility of the Scottish bench
of human rights judges. No doubt these are things that the committee
under John McCluskey will examine. Before a come to the substance of
your question, the advocate general, the person responsible for advising
the British Government on legal matters convened just such a
committee under the equally stellar chairmanship of Professor David
Edward, formerly at judge in the Court of Session, but also a court
from the European Court of Justice. That is the court that he was of
the European Union. So we have already had a review, there will be
another review, I have no doubt that they will give consideration
to the sort of issues that you referred to. But if the way that
this had been begun is that they had said there was an issue here
and they would like a group of Scottish lawyers to consider it,
then nobody could have objected. Why people have objected is the at
the sphere in which this has been conducted. On a completely
different subject, there are reports in one of the papers today
that an RAF base will be turned into at tourist airport. The EU
attach any credibility to that? This idea was current five or six
years ago. I had been assured as recently as last week by ministers
of government that no decision has yet been taken. I continue as a
constituency MP to campaign to the best of my ability, because I
believe the strategic case, the case for providing the air defence
of the top half of the United Kingdom is best achieved by
maintaining the base as it is. It was chosen for its responsibility
in the cold war. Its position is the same. It responsibilities have
not changed. It isn't the right place at the right time and doing
the right job.    it is in the right place at the right time.
The BBC Scotland documentary The Scheme, which chronicled the lives
of residents on a Kilmarnock housing estate, may be criticised
as being little more than so called poverty porn, but it was also
praised for highlighting the poverty and deprivation that
affects many parts of Scotland. It has prompted campaigners to call
for more investment in early years intervention as a means of
preventing social problems later in life. Hayley Jarvis reports.
The I would never be a smack head. The scheme it forward families in
Kilmarnock, poverty and unemployment and addiction were
some of the issues raised in the four part series. But some local
residents said the programme did not sure how the community was
running around trying to prevent the social problems. With
initiatives like this. Community spirit is really alive and I don't
think The Scheme are really picked up on it. Children come in the
dollar and something you cannot even bear to think of the things
that the EC at home. They get a bit of normality here. They do not have
any stresses placed on them. The children can play and have fun.
children who use the centre say it keeps them off the streets. You do
get bored. You come in after school and the have homework. The centre
helps young people aged five to 25. But then his current policy on
Apolis    pressure on policy makers to intervene. In Glasgow, we would
have the largest accident and emergency service in Europe to deal
with knife crime on Friday afternoon to Sunday morning, or we
wait until children have done badly at school and then we wonder why
they are not getting jobs. All of these things are linked, not too
bad schools, but to what happens in the very earliest months and years
of life. And instead of thinking about investing at the point of
impact, when things go wrong, what we really ought to do is go back
and stop things becoming wrong in the first place. It is an approach
already adopted by this centre in South Ayrshire. Stepping stones for
families gives mothers support during pregnancy until the child
goes to nursery. I am definitely a lot more patient and more
understanding being a parent. They do things with them that I do not
always have time to do. Painting pictures, reading, speech. Are
bringing children on with their speech, it is really good with that.
Children go through various transitions in the lights and if we
work with children in their early years, that supports them to go
through those transitions and make responsible decisions for
themselves and move into their adult it. The work that we do,
prevention, that is the key to opening the door for them in the
future. A recent Scottish campaign encourages his parents to play,
read and talked to their children. But some are not convinced of the
merits of early intervention into family life. At one level, I think
it is a way of blaming poverty on parenting. It is the idea that if
we could get in before five years old, all the social problems would
go away. That is very deterministic. It projects a side to that it
children have died rough upbringing, then they are finished. It is
interesting that is how society might start to understand children.
Parents ask that    teachers asked himself why should borer.   
teachers ask themselves why they should bother. This week, Minister
is expected to sit it the    set out the government policy on
education. Sir John Elvidge, once Scotland's
top civil servant, says the country's record on early
intervention compares well with others. But, speaking at a
conference in Edinburgh about spending public money to prevent
future problems, he called for improvements.
We have lifted results for lots of families, but we have and not
necessarily narrow the gap between those who go well out of those
services and those who'd do less well. The people that are most 
traded to benefit from their help, race away that bit faster and we
are still grappling, as I think people elsewhere are, are to make
sure that the benefit goes to those who need it most.
With me is former headteacher Sue Palmer, who has written extensively
on childhood. In our Edinburgh studio is Sarah Burton, who is the
senior policy manager with Children In Scotland, who are organising
tomorrow's conference in New Lanark. Early years intervention into
parenting skills can be very controversial. The EU think we're
getting ahead of the curve? words, early intervention, our way
   are where some of the Proms are coming. It is very negative. I
think the film showed a positive environment. Rather than going in
and tried to identify problems that need fixing, what is very
mechanistic and not a human way of working with people. Other many
projects that they have that are doing good work and that can be
expanded. I think the problem at the moment is that it is very
fragmented and piecemeal. The policies committed to a
universalist approach and aspires to the best that you can see in
Scandinavian countries. It is putting together the funding, the
sport and the services to match the policy that is there. That is where
the difficulty comes. I think a lot of that is down to the
fragmentation of local authorities. You were also very uncomfortable
about that term. I totally agree. There is something so inhuman about
that. If anything, the dozens of caring for very young children his
personal, deeply personal, and that is about people supporting each
other on a very personal level. that support be more structured?
as as structured as it needs to be. In certain cases, people whose own
jilted was perhaps very deprived and haven't got it skills to pass
on from there on experience, maybe you do need more structured support,
but, I mean, there is not    there is an extremely good scheme that
has been trial in Edinburgh at the moment, the first city wide trial
in the wild after 30 years of success in this scheme. That
involves matching up pregnant young mums with an older nurse, and of
authoritative but friendly figure, who sort of mothers the mother and
father. You think it is quite difficult and you have to be
sensitive, what about when the children get to school? Should we
be looking now at Early years' schooling and Pratt did no better
approach to that? I am astounded that Scotland has not fault the
Scandinavian model for the three to seven. If you really want to do a
proper kindergartens stage, then we should be starting formal schooling
at seven and having a proper phase between the three and seven for all
her children. They all need it. What do you make of that? I agree.
I think learning that is taking place is understanding the need of
play. We have outdoor learning, physical, all of that works to
support brain development. When you sit down and you have learned to do
the formal reading and writing, it comes more easily than when you
have less time for that activity. We make it more difficult for her
children than be need to. When the top but starting formal learning
later, it is very important to stress that that it does not mean
that children are not in a learning environment until that stage. They
would be playing it said, climbing trees, all kinds of different
things that media and a much better position to gain formal learning.
And also doing what you see them doing in Finland, music, a lot of
story and the drama. It is developing not just the cognitive
and the physical, but also the social and emotional aspect of
children's lights.    leads.    lives. It is said there has been
too much emphasis on the rights of parents in a legal issues. Do you
think that is an area of law in Scotland that could be used looked
The earlier you put a positive thing around a child, the better
the benefit. It is more difficult if to do it later in life. You are
not encountering the family where there is a problem. You have the
relationship with professionals early on, before pregnancy, during
pregnancy, so you can give the best support to prevent problems
happening so you are not having to go in at a certain time and do an
intervention. Rather than thinking of it as a question of parents
Against children, it is getting support from as early as possible
to make sure that things do not happen. I agree. It has to be done,
better to be done quickly and in those circumstances where it is
essential. That is worth looking at? Yes. This is very narrow. We
are looking at a small percentage of the population. The Scottish
government is doing something very helpful in terms of the policy and
the website that it has put up. We are the only country in the UK that
has done anything like that to support parents in those first
years. It is very exciting and progressive. It is a good start.
Thank you. Getting the power over corporation
tax is one of the key demands of the new Scottish Government. It is
seen by them as a way of making Scotland more attractive to
business. But while there are pros, some of the cons have been emerging.
Northern Ireland is leading the way in the drive to devolve the tax
powers, but First Minister Peter Robinson warned that gains would be
offset by reductions from the Westminster block grant. He also
suggested that the Stormont Assembly might have a case that
cannot be matched by the Holyrood Parliament.
Because of our unique circumstances, in Northern Ireland, we have a
neighbour to the south, a lower corporation tax, it cannot be
ignored they have come out of a prolonged period of conflict and
that has had an adverse impact on the infrastructure. The catching up
that has to be done in terms of job opportunities and growing our
economy... There is no doubt that in Northern Ireland, because of the
tour, they are in the lead. It is in the interests of the rest of us
to see that Northern Ireland is successful because we want to be
following on behind Northern Ireland at not too much a distance.
So Alex Salmond remains determined to press ahead, and while the
Treasury is digesting the Scottish Government's demand for control of
corporation tax, our neighbours just over the border are worried.
Will companies head north to take advantage of a lower Scottish rate
on their profits? In England, they say they will not take the
challenge lying down. They aim to come up with their own incentives
for business. Derek Crawshaw has been south of the border, from West
to East. It is one of the biggest names in English business. The
group includes rail, air, ports, even at any    energy generation.
It is best known for its trucks. There are more than 2,000 of them
and plenty of them pass through this depot in Carlisle. In the
future, might Cumbrian based companies be looking enviously to
Scotland, where the Government hopes to lower the rate of
corporation tax? They are a member of Chamber of Commerce, who say
they are relaxed about Scotland's ideas at the moment but further on,
they know there are plans to keep businesses from being attracted
north. Clearly, we would have to respond. Maybe it would not be
meeting like for like. It is perhaps not the best way of
achieving investment. But we would have to come up with an equally
compelling package of measures to make sure businesses remained where
they were. It is not something that affects businesses tomorrow and
most of the businesses we are dealing with are dealing with the
immediate economic issues now. We understand Scotland wants to
increase its competitiveness and wants to get investment into
Scotland but this is really a longer term strategy. The Scottish
government has already made his case for controlling corporation
tax. A the objective of the Government is to create the most
impressive taxation environment as is possible for Scotland. We would
be looking, as we have done with business rates, do have a lower
rate of corporation tax in Scotland because we have a lower rate of
business rates in Scotland because of the significant discounts we
offer to small businesses. If you are successful in developing
greater levels of that    economic activity, you generate more tax.
Although you may reduce what you take from corporation tax, you
increase the volume of taxation, whether it is in corporation tax or
employment tax or income tax. You have got to look at the entire sum
that is involved here, where have we are successful in stimulating
economic activity, there is a benefit to the public purse as a
consequence. That allows us to invest in public services. So if
Scotland is going to set its own rate of corporation tax, it is
hoping to make its welcome to businesses even warmer. The effects
of that will be felt not just here in Cumbria but right along the
English side of the border and beyond. The region around Newcastle
aims to welcome business with open arms. It is one of several were
vying to get the extra financial incentives which come with
enterprise zone status in England. For a conference in the city board
together businesses and politicians to find ways of improving the
economy.    brought together. They are not ignoring the challenge from
north of the border. This issue is on the agenda and is about power.
We are here in Newcastle talking about rebalancing the economy and
strengthening the economy of the North of England. The North of
England does not have the many benefits that Scotland enjoys.
Scotland can decide its own trading and skills policy, we cannot do
that here in the North of England. We need to look at a more localised
agenda in order to address that and learn from Scotland. For in terms
of the bigger question of changing the rate of corporation tax in
Scotland, looking at it from the perspective of businesses here in
the North of England, there will be a lot of concern that actually as
places border Scotland, they could be the replacement of businesses.
People might relocate north of the border to enjoyed a lower rate of
corporation tax. What we need to do here is to grow our own business
base and grow our economy. The old shipyard brings the competitive
market into focus. They are hoping to win a big contract to build wind
turbines. Renewables and regeneration of vital for both
England and Scotland. If you look at examples where we are trying to
find investment at the moment and perhaps offshore wind farms are a
good example, we are a little concern Scotland might be stealing
a march from England. We think lowering the corporation tax will
create a hub for competition between us. We are reducing
corporation tax deadly in both areas. There is a potential
negative impact here for an area like the north east, which is so
close to the border, if that is a policy which is deliberately
designed to attract more business activity to north of the border.
That would clearly be a concern we would have here. How much does
money talk for corporation taxpayers? England is wondering to
what extent a rate cut in Scotland will make business walk?
Joining me up his Garry Clark on the Scottish Chambers of Commerce
and that political commentator Alf Young. We are hearing businesses
will come into Scotland if the corporation tax is cut. That has
got to be good news? I think there is some evidence around the world
that the rate at which companies are charged tax on their profits
determines where they go. It is not true for every company, it is not
true everywhere. But there is the evidence that people will move. One
of the things that was mentioned in your film was a enterprise zones,
which the Government introduced the idea of reintroducing them in the
last Budget. There is an option for the Scottish government to have
them. There was evidence from the past that you got companies moving.
What you tend to get his displacement. They move from an
area that is not within the zone to an area that is within the zone. It
is a region that has a different tax rate, you will get some
movement. There is no doubt about that. The question is whether you
can constructed in such a way that the cost of doing it and the knock
on effects of how you do it actually leave you with only a
marginal increase in activity and not enough for the cost of what it
is going to cost revenue and implementation. It is reasonable
for the Government with its present mandate to say, we do not agree
with the way Westminster is dealing with this recession. We need this
as part of a package of responses, not on its own, but part of a
package. That is there? Absolutely. To be fair to the Scottish
administration, they have been arguing for a lower rate of tax for
some time. The problem is the Irish example, where there is a
consultation currently underway issued by the Treasury, that was
about trying to close the gap between its two parts of the other
island. There was clearly, because of the much lower rates south of
the line, a much more dynamic economy compared to the north. If
we all start doing it, it is a series of dominoes that will fall
over. If Northern Ireland get sick, then it is followed by Scotland,
followed by parts of England saying, we want it, too, then the dominoes
stock following and I suspect that the end of the day in that scenario,
the Treasury just says, why would we let any of them do it? There is
no point. If the thing will rumble on for years and we could actually
find it comes to a shouting match, we could find the Treasury
withdraws from a whole idea of it. I think something of Peter
Robinson's rather tetchy response to what is happening here in
Scotland is that he knows if Scotland pushes it, Northern
Ireland may lose it. For businesses, the principal, lower tax, it will
stimulate growth, that would be a good idea? We always welcome lower
tax. Our members are keen to establish the most    the best
advantage as possible. Corporation tax could fall within that category.
As an organisation, we have yet to take a view of whether we will
support it. Certainly, at face value, we would simply say double
thing that tax would create the possibility to have a lower tax and
allow us to do business more competitively.    devolving. There
are a number of practicalities in terms of the implementation of the
tax, how would applied.    how it would apply. The evolution of some
reliefs have meant Scottish businesses have ended up worse off
than their English competitors. We need to keep a close eye on it.
What about the potential problem that you could generate increased
revenue over time because the businesses are expanding and you
take the Revenue and replace the money you have lost from lowering
the taxes but they might be this gap and presumably if there is a
gap of any sort in public sources     public services, that there be a
problem? There is another challenge and that is to do with state aid.
In the cases where this has happened in the past, with a fiscal
jurisdiction, there is the case in the European Court of Justice which
is going to affect how this is implemented. That effectively says
if you are going to going to administration within its territory,
that has to be done on the basis it is not a state aid. In order to do
that, you give them the power to cut tax but with another hand you
take away from the grant money that comes to them a proportion that
takes account of any state aid in a process. You are doing the lower
tax and hoping you get dynamism    activity. You might lose �250
million a year in the block grant that goes to the Northern Ireland
government because that is regarded as the state aid element. Scotland
