Hello, within weeks, Greece could have tumbled, stalked, or been
chucked out of the euro. An intense nervousness, panic in some places,
is at large. All of us will be affected. Tonight, how it could
happen and what will be the consequences. If Spain falls apart,
will the face of Europe be changed forever. We have the Nobel Prize 
winning economist, Paul Krugman here, the Harvard economist,
Kenneth Rogoff, and from Athens, former Greece politician, Giorgos
Papakonstantinou. Many think that the Germans will
soon blink, that forcing Greece out of the euro will be unthinkable,
what if they are wrong? We will tackle the question whether
George Osborne's medicine for this country is not so quietly killing
the patient. The Government's central aim is to
cut the deficit and establish international credibility, what if
the eurozone crisis means they can do neither.
We will hear from Dublin, where they are being asked to vote for
long years of austerity, to atone for their bankers' sins. David
Cameron's former Director of Communications, Andy Coulson, has
Glasgow. We will have the latest.
The world's biggest company, ensuring people who export goods,
said today it was no longer covering anyone who wants to send
stuff to Greece. Nothing will change before the election there on
June 17th, and the latest opinion polls show the biggest parties in
favour and against the bail out are at absolutely level pegging. Which
is no help to anyone, really. In the meantime, there is talk of
power cuts because there is no money to pay energy suppliers. So
the rest of the eurozone, now contemplates something we were told
was inconceivably, recently, that like a bad kebab, Greece is vomited
out of the single currency. What happened today? Almost every day
focus, unreality, incompetence, general clutching at straws, as the
train hurtles towards you. Today was no different. You mentioned
today that the Greek press got hold of a document to the Prime Minister
that they may face blackouts because they can't pay electricity
bills. We find out in the next 24 hours how much money has fled
Greece over the past week. We know if the    in the past three months
58 million has fled Europe over the past few months. Spain is in
serious trouble and needs a bank bail out. There is the mechanism to
do, that the European Union has the money to do that. Right now Spain
doesn't want to take that money. It is saying, we don't want to be like
Ireland, we don't want to be the slaves of Europe. This is, of
course, on the eve, tomorrow, of the Irish referendum. Where the
Irish are going to sign up for an austerity deal that the Spanish
have just negotiated a one year opt out from, that is conyou fewed,
so is everybody else    if that is confusing, so is everybody else.
Greece could leave the euro? Ever since the Brussels summit last week
the feeling is, most people think, look, Merkel is talking tough to
try to get Greek voters to go back to the centre. To recoil in horror
from any exit from the eurozone, so they vote how the European Union
would like them. Most people think, whether it is just before or just
after the elections, the Germans will have to relent and say it is a
bluff. And they will give the Greeks some extra time to pay, like
Spain, another year to meet the targets. That is what the money is
on at the moment. But, as we are about to see, the ability of
politicians to effect economics, ever since Lehman Brothers, has
been very limited. If Greece left the euro, the
reaction would be frantic. Every Government, every Central Bank, and
all financial markets would be faced with immediate choices.
But the first 48 hours of a Greek exit would depend on precisely why
the exit happened. Politically it is impossible to
expel Greece from the eurozone, and none of the parties likely to win
the election want to leave, including the left. So a Greek exit
would be messy. Driven by economics, driven by capital flight, bank run,
and the breakdown of cross border payment mechanisms. If you lent
money in euros to Greece, and your debt is redenominated into drachmas,
which falls against the euros, you will get less money back. There is
also a significant likelihood that banks would go under in Greece, a
large number of companies would probably be bankrupt as well. So
there would be more straight forward forms of default as well.
With the far left riding high in the election. And the far right on
the March, any financial collapse would    march, any financial
collapse would spell trouble. There is already trouble.
We have got total polarisation, we have an economic programme the
Greeks didn't vote for. We have violence in the streets. We have
got Neo Nazis in parliament. That is before any problems of euro
exit? Yeah, absolutely. Before any problems of euro exit. The other
thing people say, it is awful, but it is awful now.
For London, as a financial centre, there would be deep concern. Not
over Greece, but over the three trillion euros worth of foreign
money sitting in Italy and Spain, which might leave.
The very sense of crisis and uncertainty, is jittering the
global markets, which is having an effect on our real economy. It is
not through trade or diplomatic links, and they would be deeply
concerned that the sense of instability would mean that any
other institution that was not completely 100% robust, would sense
the shockwaves and find themselves in a more perilous situation.
British banks' exposure to Greece is small. Exposure to sovereign
debt of Italy and Spain, is just over 10 million to Barclays, RBS
and HSBC, but it would decrease the value of eurobonds across the
eurozone. And here RBS, with 0 billion total exposure, is among
the highest in Europe. In the first 48 hours after a Greek exit,
everything would depend on preventing the financial collapse
of Spain. The money to do that exist, right now Spain is quibbling
over the terms of accepting it. As for Greece, it would face not
only banking and monetary chaos, its exports would more or less
double in cost, that is bad. There is a lot of fear. People are very,
very worried about this. It feels like falling off the edge of a
cliff to a lot of people. There is a lot of fear about poverty, about
hunger, about political chaos. Greece imports 40% of the food at
the moment. Almost all its medicines, all its oil. And as the
Greeks left, the credibility of the euro as a permanent currency union
would be shattered. Giorgos Papakonstantinou is in
Athens, where he was until recently a Government minister,'s now a
PASOK candidate in the forth coming elections, and taking an anxious
interest in things there. Paul Krugman is a Nobel Prize winning
economist, who is betting on an exit from the euro zone. Do you
think as a currency the euro is worth saving? I think it is a
mistake, but it is a difficult thing to say it should never have
been done and it is likely to collapse. I would like to save the
euro. But I don't think Greece and the euro is a reasonable
proposition. Giorgos Papakonstantinou, why is leaving
the euro a bad idea from the Greek perspective? Well, first of all,
can I take issue with your bad kebab analogy, which I find
offensive. The Greek economy is in a crisis s the Greek people are
going through a lot, they deserve some respect. I really didn't find
that very appropriate. Coming to your question, leaving the euro
would lead to reduction with a GDP falling by over 20%. It would
double today's extremely high unemployment from 20% to over up to
40%. It would lead to a halving of living standards, and to widespread
poverty. Today's situation is very difficult and very bad, but leaving
the euro would lead the economy back to the 50s and 60s, that is
not something they would want to live through. I would support that,
that was quite inappropriate to say the Greeks have done something
terribly wrong, they made errors, but the trouble, the reason, it is
going to be awful, if Greece exits. It will be awful in the short run.
The trouble is the situation for Greece is hopeless, and I mean that
in a quite literal sense. Under the euro, there is nothing on the
horizon to suggest any recovery, ever. We are looking at extremely
high unemployment, being shut out of the capital markets, as far as
the eye can see. While an exit would be terrible, there would be,
you can see how a recovery could happen afterwards. I understand
that nobody wants to bite that bullet. Nobody wants to take that
decision. Which is why I think it is actually that the decision will
be take be out    taken out of the hands of the politicians. If anyone
can give me any story where Greece returns to prosperity or a halfway
acceptable situation staying within the euro, I would be happy to
reconsider, I haven't seen that story. Can you imagine such a story,
Giorgos Papakonstantinou? I do, I deliver here with Paul, I think
that clearly we need much more time than what the current programme
gives us, to put the finances in order. But we are very close to
running a primary surplus. The main problem is the economy isn't
growing, and the economy isn't growing, it wasn't growing before
the bail out. We were actually in recession since 2008. Before we
started the austerity package. Clearly the austerity package has
made things much worse. We need growth. Growth needs to come with
the help of our European partners, through some kind of a growth
package. With confidence returning and investment flowing back in. We
have a privatisation programme, which should attract foreign
investment. For all this to work you have to have a stablised
situation, at the moment Europe is not giving the right signals. There
has been some progress in improving the institutional architecture, but
not enough. And the big moves have not been made yet. I'm hopeful that
there is a wind of change in Europe at the moment, following also the
French election, which will change the emphasis away from exclusively
looking at austerity, and balancing it more with growth, and having the
banks being able to bring the liquidity into the system. At the
moment you have both the demand not being there, because wages and
salaries have been cut, and a banking system not funking, which
doesn't provide working cap    functioning which doesn't provide
working capital. How close are things to not working there?
have had a fragmented result, from an election, and we have an
election where the result is hanging in the air. The polls at
the moment give the Conservatives and the left parties pretty much
equal results. So it is touch and go, where this will go, it is clear
the problems are too big for one party to shoulder this. We tried
this for two years, we had an absolute majority in parliament and
we failed. That is the point, my sense is, in fact, the coalition in
Greece was doing all of the things it was asked to do. The trouble is
that was not producing growth. That nothing plausibly on the horizon
will produce growth. Even if the sternness of European austerity
demanded is lessened a bit, that will not provide growth. Greece is
highly uncompetitive in growth, the idea that you can close those
structural reforms in any time frame is unreasonable. Some of us
cut our teeth in way on the Argentine crisis more than a decade
ago. It was, in some ways, easier, because they had their own currency.
It was the same thing, there was no plausible route back to an
acceptable economic situation, except via devaluation. I think
that's going to be the case here. We just don't see how this can ever
be reinvolved, otherwise. Remember, however, in the last two years, we
clawed back the competition that was lost, in unit labour costs,
since the starting of the eurozone. Greece has some existing advantages,
like tourism and shipping, and some new ones like renewables, logistics.
It does have the natural resources, the people, the ideas, to move
forward. But it costs you power? keep the engine growing.
eventually you lost power? We did. I actually take the same view, I
think there is a lot of fundamental strengths, which are reasons why
Greece, after an exit might recover much more quickly than people think.
But the notion that the exports, essentially it will require exports,
one way or another, the notion that the exports will come on stream,
fast enough, with no, under the current regime, to avoid what is an
on going catastrophy becoming unmanageable. I hope and would love
to believe you are right. This is a horrible situation, it is a trap,
and not the fault of the Greeks for the most part. But, my God, how
much longer can this last, the action forcing the event will, of
course, be people pulling money out of Greek banks. The ECB has to
offer either unlimited credit, with no security, or pull the plug.
Maybe they will do that, maybe they will string it on for another year.
I find it hard to believe. You are geting any signs in Athens of
concessions about to be made to you? I think it is clear that the
troika is realising, also partly as a result of the election result,
but partly also, looking at the fundamentals of the economy, that
something has to give. If you ask any economist they will tell you
that the fiscal path we have been following is extreme. We reduced
the primary deficit by eight percentage points in two years.
That has never been done before. To continue on this path, without
giving it some slack, makes no sense. The more you hit on the
fiscal side, the more difficult structural reforms become. Because
the society is in such a difficult situation it is very hard to get
acceptance around necessary reforms, but reforms always have people who
oppose them. You do need, and the troika is ready to give, and the
European partners, thinking of Germany, because it comes down to
that, certainly some leeway of the base on the fiscal side. And
hopefully on some other issues as well.
Thank you very much. Only a fool would predict precisely how this
crisis will end, but Greece is far from the end of the story. The
interest the Spanish Government has to pay to borrow money reached
record levels today, because so many people who ought to know,
seriously doubt whether it has the wherewithal to keep the country's
banks afloat. Spain, the fourth  biggest economy in the eurozone,
threatens the entire edifice, it is not about individual countries but
whether the euro itself can be rescued.
Imagine this, it is six months on from the Greek exit, it has been
orderly, negotiated, there has been no euro crash. But on the housing
estates of peripheral Europe, things are very bleak.
I think six months after a Greek exit we would still be in a period
of economic and financial uncertainty and weakness. Our
expectation is that the economy would contract, fairly sharply, we
would expect the eurozone GDP to drop something like 5%, on a par
what we saw during the global recession of a couple of years ago.
If all that looks bleak, it is possibly the best you could hope
for if Greece exits, because a disorderly exit could, six months
down the line, pose severe threats to the entire europroject. The
biggest systemic risk is Spain, its economy is shrinking now, its
sovereign debt already verging on unmanageable, its banking sector
sitting on a mountain of bad debt that nobody wants to calculate.
think there is a serious chance that the eurozone could break up.
There are adverse economic factors on going. There are crippling high
levels of debt and problems, one has to fear the exit process of a
country like Spain, would effectively sound the death knell
for the euro all together. Until now Germany insistence on austerity
for Greece has been seen as a giant bluff. But if it does drive Europe
to ruination, even stalwarts of the political centre, now see that as
changing the debate over austerity versus growth. It may be that the
approach of the Washington consensus, and George Osborne and
Cameron, is simply wrong, and that Greece is one of the first people,
because they have absolutely nothing to lose. The first groups
of people putting their head above and saying, no, we are not
accepting this. I think it might be totemic, for how the whole
austerity project is seen. Economists find it hard to model
what is coming. At least they are thinking about it. The problem is,
for the centrist politicians and civil servants who run Europe, they
don't even want to think about it. When you look at what is happening
in Greece, on the streets, you can see why. The old split between left
and right is still there underneath. It still simers, there is still a
sense of families and political history. Your grandfather killed my
grandfather, that could come back? Your grandfather killed my
grandfather, it is already coming back. The political goss are from a
past Greece thought it had put behind it. If it fails there is no
shortage of specters to haunt Europe. Paul Krugman is still with
us, with a similar enlike peedic knowledge of euroaffairs, we have
Kenneth Rogoff in Washington. What is the problem here, is it one of
demand for debt? Well, I think that fundamental problems is a huge
overhang of doubt you have to deal with. You can't deal with it
watching the periphery countries of Europe being in recession for ten
years. That is not going to happen. There has to come a plan to bring
the debt down. Growth is a piece of it. They need to write down debt
and need inflation. They need plan for restoring competitiveness in
the periphery. If they are not going to have their own currency,
then the euro needs to go down. way I think about Spain, is for ten
years they were seen as the golden boy of Europe, now it is safe
because it is part of the eurozone, money flooded in. A lot of it the
Germany banks lending to Spanish banks, which fuelled a huge housing
bubble. A lot of inflation, they get uncompetitive, the bubble
bursts, how do they get back to being competitive again? The
current strategy is that they should cut their wages, and some
how do enough austerity to pay that debt. It is impossible. The demands
being placed on Spain are impossible. If Greece exits, then
everybody says it is impossible, money starts flooding out of Spain
and Europe has a choice. And the choice is? The choice is, Ken and I
seem to agree, that credit has to be made available, open ended
lending, so when people pull their euros out the banks don't collapse.
An unlimited supply of euros from frack further. More debt? It is
temporary, because if the panic stops the money comes back. You
have to have inflation in Europe, instead of Spain having to cut its
wages, at least it is not solely through cuts of Spanish wages, but
we will have rising German wages, which is an easier way for Spain to
become competitive. It is a change in the vision of Germany policy.
Instead of punishing the debtors and having price stability, they
have to have something more liberal, they have to have a party.
Rogoff, inflation and more debt, is that a solution? No, I don't agree
with the more debt. I certainly agree about writing down debt. I
think inflation is a piece of the solution, all over the world. I
don't think there is really way to go forward here without having some
political union, or vision of political union. I don't think this
is all about Germany being stingy. It is also about not wanting to
have    st, ing ey it is also about not wanting to have an open bar for
the rest of Europe. I'm not saying what they are proposing is
necessarily nearly the end of things. I really think the only way
this is going to end is either Europe starts to look like a real
country, and I mean France and Germany, part of the same country,
central Government with a lot of taxing power, or it splits up.
Unless they start moving that way enthusiastically soon, I don't
think anything will stablise the situation. I hope's wrong about
that, if he's right it will be over. I have done Ireland versus Nevada,
not the landscape, but everything else looks remarkably similar.
Because the way the US fiscal system exists, Nevada is receiving
de facto aid on the scale of 5 6% of GDP, from Washington. Try to
imagine that Europe, that Germany would be willing to countenance a
system where 5 6% of GDP, not in loans, but actual aid, is given to
southern European countries at the moment, that is not conceivable.
That is a generation's work. We don't have a generation, we may not
have more than a few months here. By that analysis, the euro has had
it? Some doubt write downs, that some default, plus some inflation,
might make it, might make it manage gt, over a five year d manageable,
over a five year period to get an adjustment. That is not good, the
solution that the United States of Europe is much to be desired.
it won't happen during my working lifetime.
Ken Rogoff, you tried to get in? think that will be a problem. I
think they need to lay out a vision, it could be 15 20 years, right now
it is a moving 40 50 years. But they need to lay out a vision where
it is going forward, not backward. I think the French election was in
some sense a rejection of moving to a closer Europe, a rejection of
having more interdependance. I certainly see that Germany, one way
or another, is not going to get paid. Either because there is going
to be default, inflation or it will make transfers t has to pick its
poison. I'm very sympathetic to their wanting rules, at least
trying to negotiate. That said, they may find themselves blinking
again and again, simply because they are being gamed into making
the big payments and transfers, because it is so catastrophic what
will happen if they don't. What should western Governments be doing
now? They have to stop the panic here. That is the number one
problem. I think over the longer term there is a huge overhang of
debt, public, private, external debt, that gradually needs to be
deflated out of the of the system. Some through growth, there are very
few historical experiences where that has been very successful.
Except in cases like Canada and Sweden, where the Governments were
very large, and they were able to shrink them and make the economies
much more efficient. I look at the European situation, as something
impossible will happen. One that the euro will be allowed to
collapse, that is unthinkable, impossible. The other is the
Germans will accept lots of debt relief, plus inflation, plus
temporarily large open ended lending, which is impossible. One
of those two impossible things will happen. It is an awesome choice. It
is not something, they will not have years to dither over this,
they have months to dither over this. It is moving very fast.
Rather surprisingly a survey out tomorrow, of how confident British
consumers feel, will show their slightly less gloomy than they were.
But the facts about the state of the economy in this country, even
without the collapse of the eurozone, are awful. The
Chancellor's sticking to his line that there is no alternative to his
austerity prescription. Not for him, the great economist, John Maynard
Keynes, said when the facts change I change my mind, what do you do.
First let's have this. "To understand my state of mind",
John Maynard Keynes wrote to his friend, George Bernard show, he
said he would be writing a book on economic theory, that would largely
revolutionise, not at once, but in the course of next ten years, the
way the world thinks about economic problems. It was a bit of a brag,
even to a friend, but as it turns out, even he was underplaying it.
Keynes ideas are still in play, nearly 70 years later. In the
summer of 2010, the Chancellor, George Osborne put in place his own
theory. Massive spending cuts, driven by a need to placate the
international bond markets. This Emergency Budget deals decisively
with our country's record debts. It pays for the past and plans for the
future. His opposite number, retaliated. With a modern day case
for Keynesian spending. coalition should act quickly and
decisively to reverse George Osborne's cuts and for household
budgets this year. We should reinstate vital investment for jobs
now. Here on the corner of John Maynard Keynes's street, is a
building site that exsemplifies his ideas of yesterday, he believes if
the economy isn't involved in the private sector, the Government has
no choice, the Government has to intervene. He said, tongue in cheek,
what you should do, is take bottles, and fill them with pound coins, and
put them at the bottom of the large well and put it down there. The
employment of getting the bags out would stimulate the economy. That
is where critics of the Government say we are now. On the one hand you
have �700 billion of public sector private assets that they don't want
to spend. And there is historic low rates of borrowing that the
Government enjoys and could be better used to stimulate the
economy. That is what they think should be done and they are still
Keynesian followers. The Government could actually restore some of its
capital programmes that have been cut. For example, the school
building programme has been cut by 80%. I think much of those cuts
should be reversed. There are other programmes which would be better to
be done by a national investment bank. Because that would get a lot
of the spending off the Government's balance sheet, if
people are worried that the Government is being profligate.
Critics of neo Keynesian sound warnings. They point out our
economy has generous automatic fiscal monitor, spending rising.
They say the Government is borrowing a fair amount, not much
less than a Labour Government would have done. The Government is
spending close to 50% of GDP, their plan is to get down to to 40% over
the next couple of years. If they want to provide confidence in the
economy, what they need to be doing is getting close to 30%. That would
also allow tax cuts, that would encourage private investment.
are many reasons why the Government doesn't think the time is right for
apartheid of pronounced Keynesian spending. But there are two that
stand out. The first one, according to the ideas of the man himself,
you don't run a deficit during a time of economic boom. The current
Government believe that is exactly what the previous Government did,
and they are now dealing with the effects of it. There is also
unfunded pension liabilities, that this Government is also trying to
deal with. They believed Keynes didn't have them at the time of his
writing, and you can't keep kicking a debt can down the road.
Nonetheless, the Government is due to launch new programmes of
infrastructure investment soon. The debate is shifting towards a
different Keynesian insight, that monetary policy could do more heavy
lifting. The Bank of England should set nominal GDP rates, musing from
the builders until then, they wonder where he buried the pound
coins. Paul Krugman is here, Jon Moulton
joins him, and Andrea Leadsom, a Conservative MP, who previously
worked in finance for 20 years. You have given George Osborne quite
a lot of ear ache about his handle of the economy. Have you seen
anything while you have been over     handling of the economy, have you
seen anything while you have been over here to change your view?
have had two years of austerity here and elsewhere. What we have
seen, first of all, is austerity really does contract the economy.
That the notion that it would inspire business confidence, and
lead to expansion, not contraction, has been decisively proved wrong
here and across the continent. Secondly, there is growing evidence
that austerity, in these conditions, doesn't even work in fiscal terms.
Because it shrinks the economy now and also shrinks the economy in
future. It hurts the economy's long run potential, which reduces
future revenues, which worsens the long run budget position. I have
used the analogy, it is like medieval doctors that thought you
could treat a sick patient by bleeding, the patient got sicker
and they said, bleed more. That is what is happening. You have a debt
problem that is real, and the treatment is making things worse,
even in fiscal terms. Why are you shaking your head, this is a Nobel
Prize winning economist? I find his view reckless, frankly, I can't
believe that somebody as incredibly highly regarded could honestly
think that the answer is to go and borrow more money. It is very
simple mathematics, if you are in a hole, if you have overspent and
overspent, spending more is simply not going to help. It will make
things worse. You talk about austerity, in reality this is
austerity light. If you really wanted to sort the economy, they
would be doing it far faster with a shorter, sharper hit to get us
rebounding sooner than we can. There are a lot of ways to answer
that. The main thing to say, if you try to have a situation that
everyone is trying to slash at the same time, which the private sector
is trying to slash spending cuts, it feels it has too much debt, and
the Government is also saying we have too much debt, we are all
trying to slash. Then we run up against the fundamental fact that
we are not a household, but an economy. And your spending is my
income, and my spending is my income. And if we are both doing
the slashing at the same time, what we end up doing is producing a
depression that leaves us worse off. This is another thing, 1930s
American economist, Irvine Fisher, Keynes plentor, he said if
everybody tries to pay down debt, the more people save and the more
they owe. We are worsening the debt problem by not allowing the
Government to be the stablising factor. Even I struggle to attack a
Nobel Prize winner, but I think you are seriously wrong. The issue
about austerity is we have too large a state. We have let the
economy go from 30 % odd, to pushing 50%, public sector. If you
want growth you need a larger private sector, not a larger public
sector. You are also ignoring, as your book does, I have just been
reading it, waiting to come on, the very simple moral dimension of what
you are recommending. That is we run up more debt. The only thing
that debt does, it enables us to live better today, at the expense
of those who follow us. That is a serious moral argument, and you
cannot ignore it. I would put the moral argument in a different way,
if I think about the future generation, the crime we are
committing against the next generation, is not that we will
leave them with more debt. That is a venal sin, the crime is all the
students are graduating from college with no job prospects.
Graduating with debts they have incurred to get an expensive
education, and then there is no jobs. The damage we are inflicting
on the next generation, by not having jobs for them. Which is the
result of misguided austerity right now. That is the great sin. Those
jobs will be generated when people move from the public sector to the
private sector. What we need to be doing, is really making it easier
for young people to start their own businesses, making it far easier
for new entrepeneurs, you say we have to create jobs. We shouldn't
be about creating jobs, but about enabling the economy to create jobs,
low tax regimes, and opportunities for people to start up new
businesses and so on. The average young person is not going to start
a business. Why not? There has to be an expanding economy which is
not happening, it is not happening because we are not providing the
necessary support. By the way, I think you have just given me
confirmation that something people like me tend to say. Actually none
of this is at all about fiscal responsibility. It is about
exploiting the current situation to pursue an ideolgical goal of a
smaller state. You know, we can argue about whether the British
state is too large, but look at Sweden. Which is weathering it very
well, with a much larger state than you have. That is a great diversion,
that is suggesting it is not sincere, it is not the budget
deficit that is concern you, you are looking for a way to exploit
the deficit situation. You accuse     we accuse you of being wrong, and
you accuse us of lying. You are mingling concepts that are separate.
There is clear economic evidence, and you must accept as evidence,
not they are hey, that, on average, larger public sectors grow slower
than smaller ones. I don't accept that at all, we could have that
discussion but we need equation charts for that. That is not true.
So Mr Alfonso's study is rubbish. The question of size of the state,
and the question of what one should be doing right now it deal with
this crisis, ought to be separate. Surely there has to be a point that
you can either expand your private sector, by making it easier for the
private sector to expand. Or you can expand your public sec to and
the only way to do that, is by removing wealth from the private
sector, to put into the public sector. You are missing a point of
what it means to be in a depression. We are not going into a depression.
We are in a depression, there are vast numbers of workers idle who
want to work. There is vast amounts of capital going nowhere, because
there is no demand. At this point of time, the private and public
sector are not competing for resources, there are unemployed
resources, the point is to put them to work. Give me a recovery, in the
UK or US, and I will become a fiscal, be happy to find ways to
discuss about Government spending and raising revenue, in the US that
needs to be part of the solution. Not now, not under these conditions.
Don't you think efforts to reduce corporation tax, to deregulate, to
make it ease your to start new companies, to    easier to start
new companies, and make it easier for banks to lend. To improve the
private sector of the economy, that will have more impact than
borrowing more money to create jobs and throw money at things. We have
survey evidence in the United States about what it is that is
holding private businesses back. Overwhelmingably the answer is lack
of sales. There is not enough demand. Constraints on capital is
not an issue. They would like to have more skilled workers, no more
so than usual. Issues about financing are small issues,
concerns about future Government regulation, they always complain
about that, no more than usual. What has changed is there is no
demand, there is no market there. That is what the austerity policies
are worse, they are inhibiting the private sector as well as the
public. Not all of the policies have failed. Every success story
includes either high interest rates to start with, so you could bring
them down. Or a situation where you have a large currency devaluation,
that won't work now, you have to have some prosperous economy to
devalue against, there is nobody out there now. There is, a clear
example, Estonia. It doesn't fit the story at all. I don't think we
have the evidence on the Estonia example, and we haven't time to go
into it. I would love to. Come back and tell
us all about it. The people of Ireland get to vote
tomorrow on whether to swallow the medicine prescribed by Europe, it
is a quirk of the institution constitution that it requires a
referendum for the country to decide whether to accept a treaty
that most of the rest of the eurozone has already agreed to. The
Irish have a habit of rejecting EU treaties in referendums, and then
accepting them when they are told to come up with the right
conclusion. It was a Drome house, which turned into a nightmare
mansion. Vacant and abandoned, after its owners' fortunes went the
same way as the once booming island. Julia still work, but can't afford
the mortgage any more, she survives by selling her furniture, and votes
no in the referendum. This country is in a mess, because of the lack
of regulation and the banks throwing money at people. Nobody is
taking responsibility at the top, people like myself I lose my entire
life earnings, and people in more dire situations, who are struggling
to put food on the table. They are paying the penalty, the people at
the top are being protected. That is wrong. Many of Ireland's middle 
classes feel the same way, most of those voting no come from the less
well off strands of society. People have seen their standards of living
squeezed. And Sinn Fein, with less than 10% of the seats in Irish
parliament, have stopped into that anger by urging a no vote.
biggest thing the no vote would do, is to send clearly a signal to our
own Government, but then to our European partner, that it is the
considered view of the Irish people that austerity has failed. It is
therefore the responsibility of democratically elected Governments
and politicians, to come up with the Plan B. The yes side is
represented by the vast majority of political parties in Ireland, they
are warning voters if the Fiscal Compact is reject, Ireland might
not be able to get a second bail out in 2014, if one was required.
It is a tough sell, in any circumstance, where you have high
levels of unemployment, and people are hurting. Aren't they voting yes,
because they are afraid, rather than because this is the right
thing, the right forward path? think they are voting yes because
they want an insurance policy of funding there, if we cannot get
back to the markets. They are voting yes because they want proper
fiscal discipline, they don't want to go through the boom to bust
nonsense we have seen over the course of the last number of years.
They want certainty with this treaty. This treaty provides that.
Dublin's Docklands symbolises the boom and bust that was the Celtic
Tiger era. The bridges, banks, hotels that shot up in the last few
years, showed aspiration and growth, it all ended badly, symbolised in
the building over my shoulder, which would have been Anglo Irish
bank's head quarter, before it collapsed and taking with it   
headquarters, before it collapsed and took the economy with it.
House buying is non existent, but the Irish export system is booming,
with niches in pharmaceuticals and technology. This man runs one of
the biggest exporters in Ireland. If we can manage our way through
the next two years, combine that with certainty coming out of Europe,
which will trigger economic growth and economic activity. Then I think
you will see a very different Ireland. And that is why we have to
vote yes tomorrow. We're not voting for tomorrow, we are voting for the
Ireland of two years from now. We're voting for the Ireland of 40
years, for our grandchildren. But Ireland's young people may not
be able to wait a few years, they are already emigrating at a rate of
1,000 a week, not all have lost their sense of humour. You find it
interesting, you guys have seen the protests and the indignation in
Spain, the people of Greece taking to the streets and burning down
Athens. Part of you thinks, why doesn't it happen in Ireland, and
you think, we just don't have the weather for it. I'm not paying any
debt, people say that is irresponsible, what would happen if
everybody stopped paying their debt? We would be debt free.
I decided to do my own little stand up, afterall, how difficult
with it be? The reason we are here is because we are looking at the
treaty. And I was hoping to canvas your views, because unlike so many
of your peers, you haven't emigrated, yet. So all of you, how
many are "don't know", you will vote in the next 48 hours and you
still don't know. Can I ask someone why you don't no. Did you raise
your hand? Who raised their hand and said they did know. Why don't
you know? No pressure? I haven't really looked into it. Despite the
gallows humour, and the high number of undecided vote erts, even at
this late stage, both sides of the debate agree that Ireland faces a
few more years of austerity, irrespective of the outcome.
Allegra Stratton is back with us to tell us what has happened with the
Prime Minister's former head of propaganda, Andy Coulson. What was
his former title? Head of Communications. He has been
arrested? Before we went on air, he was charged and arrested. He was
detained at 6frplt30am in his home in south London in Dulwich, they
drove him, not train nor plane, they drove him to Glasgow, arrived
at 3.30, six hours of questioning, then announced they were charging
and arresting. It is down to the Scottish authorities to figure out
what they will do next. offences? Related to his appearance
at a Tommy Sheridan trial. charge? Perjury. That is serious?
Taken very seriously up there, more so. The problem for the Prime
Minister is twofold, firstly, it is something he is alleged to have
committed while working for the Prime Minister. A different
category of things he is accused of. It reminds us ahead of the Jubilee
weekend, that no matter how hard the Government tries to disentangle
itself from News International, every time they try they get
on most of tomorrow morning's front pages, of course, if I knew I had
time to show you I would. I don't have time to show you, that is the
Guardian there. He's on most of the others as well. That's all for
tonight, James Bond is here tomorrow, but until then, good
tomorrow, but until then, good night.
The heavy, thundery showers in eastern England is clearing away,
half of the UK. To the south it will be dryer and brighter, that is
where we have the last of the warmth. The rain sets in for
northern England, it will be a cool day here. A bit of raib from time
to time in the Midlands, after a bright start East Anglia could see
rain late in the day. Southern most parts of England, dry and bright,
sunshine from time to time, here we have the last of the warmth.
Temperatures 18 19, not as warm as today. South Wales doesn't look too
bad, mid and North Wales will see some rain at times, in the hills
and mountains. In Northern Ireland a poor day, rain all day, some of
which heavy. The rain in Scotland gets as far north as Inverness and
Aberdeen. It will be heaviest late morning, early afternoon, the rain
becomes lighter during the latter part of the day. A pretty poor day
across many northern parts of the UK. It should be dryer and brighter
for most areas on Friday. As you head further south, there is a lot
