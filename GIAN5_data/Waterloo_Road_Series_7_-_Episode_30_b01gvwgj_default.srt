  SCREAM There's someone in there!
  So what?
  This is what it means to be one of us. Come on!
  No!
You know what? I'm going to get you.
If you come to Glasgow, you'll have every resource you need. We can make a real difference.
You're wasting your breath.
  This ends here.
  Too right.
Just accept that it's over.
But you love me, remember?
I don't love you.
  Grimey!
Put one foot in here, it'll be the worst mistake of your life.
  I'm scared.
  Josh has stopped taking his medication.
  We're recommending that Waterloo Road is closed.
  But you can't. I've told you we're making progress.
No, I'm sorry, it's been decided. You'll have it in writing tomorrow.
Hey. Got your dancing shoes on?
  Sorry?
  It's the prom, isn't it? School prom?
Yeah, done one of my world famous CD compilations.
Bit of REO Speedwagon, Dire Straits. Get us in the party mood.
Can you gather the troops for a meeting this morning?
  What do you think that's about?
  End of term briefing, isn't it?
That can only mean one thing.
  Biscuits?
  Oh, yeah.
Hey, come on. Hurry up. We're running late as it is.
  I'm not hungry.
  What do you reckon?
The chap down the hire shop reckons David Beckham's got one just like it.
  He saw you coming.
  You'll be the sharpest dude at the prom.
Seriously, Dad, who says "dude" any more?
Sorry, mate.
I just feel a bit...you know...
A bit of a kick about, chinwag with your mates before the term ends.
It'll be like you've never been away.
  You better come in.
  Look, sir, I know I've been an awful mate,
  but I'm finished with all the gang stuff.
  I'll have to take your word for it, won't I?
  Or maybe I should check your pockets for matches.
  That wasn't me!
Look, Josh, I owe you an apology. I should have come round
but I just got caught up with some stupid stuff.
I'm sorry I let you down, man.
Yeah, you did.
I mean, what else can I say?
Are you coming?
Wish me luck.
Hey...
I'm proud of you.
  Have you been ordering stuff off Dad's credit card again?
  No!
  Do you mind? It took me ages to paint that.
  Whatever.
  Proms are dry. I ain't dressing in no suit for no one.
  Except the magistrate.
The only loser around here is you, Tariq.
Sorry, I stand corrected.
You got any food, man? I'm starving.
  The shower not working in yours, or something?
  I've been kicked out.
  What for?
  Dealing weed.
  Mum's getting a bit edgy now that the police are sniffing about.
  Listen, fam. We've got heat.
  Nice. That dealer's good.
  This is you?
  Payback time.
  Finn Sharkey?
  We've got to put him in his place. Properly scare him.
Your kid sister was nearly burned alive in that garage.
Perfect opportunity. It's time to step up the levels, blud.
Release them L plates.
  There ain't no way of getting that past the detectors.
  I'll throw it over the wall.
There's teachers patrolling everywhere. Seriously, fam.
  It's a no go.
  Look, here's Ronan, you keep him talking.
  I'll put it in the back. We'll take it out the other side.
  But he don't like me.
  Hurry up!
  Oi! What are you doing? Get away from the van.
  What are you doing here?
  I'm catering for the prom.
  Ha! Fruit and veg business already gone belly up?
  Diversifying.
  You got a flat.
  No, I haven't, I'd have felt it.
  Seriously. You need to check it.
  You better not have punctured it.
  See? Solid as a rock.
  Must be me eyes.
  Are you blind as well as thick?
  Leave it, mate. He's not worth it.
  Has it really got this bad?
  It's precautions, innit?
I heard you talking in the hall with my dad.
About the gangs. What's going on?
  We're late, mate, come on.
  Some mate, you.
You disappear off the radar, then when I want you to be straight with me, you won't.
  Just forget it.
  All right, mate, OK.
I got in a load of beef with Tariq.
I joined a gang. I fell into the MSB and then...
Wow. And you're the one treating me like a moron?
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm the director of education.
I have a duty to the staff. Advise them of their options.
I'll find you an office. In the meantime, can you keep a low profile
until I've broken news of the school's closure?
Mmm. Yeah, there's been a slight change of plan.
  I still run this place.
  Yeah, but...
  No buts.
The very least they deserve is the respect of being told face to face...by ME.
Might be a little bit late for that.
  They're closing the school.
  What?
"A strategic review of education services has concluded that
"Waterloo Road's position has become untenable,
"and that the decision has been made to close the school at the end of the academic year."
Did you know about this?
They finally did it. They've finally pulled the plug.
  They can't do this to us. Michael won't allow it.
  He already has.
The boss has jumped ship.
Do one.
Before anybody says anything,
there was absolutely no way I would have wanted you to find out like this.
We all have Mr Dixon to thank for that.
"We'd like to take this opportunity to wish Mr Byrne all the best in his new post."
And for the record, I didn't accept the job until after the LA had made its decision.
Oh! Spun like a pro.
Mr Dixon will be available throughout the day to discuss alternative employment options.
  Redundancies, more like.
  We're just being shipped off, just like that?
Well, there is another way. You could come with me.
We're setting up a school, privately funded, from scratch.
  Available to local kids of all abilities.
  A private school.
No. An independent school. No fees. Just a benefactor.
Lorraine Donnegan. Sian, you've met her before.
What happened to the champion of the state sector?
Some of us believe in that system. Some of us are proud of its achievements.
Look, I'm not suggesting for one minute that Waterloo Road is a failure of the state system.
Far from it. But we are a victim of circumstance.
This new school is an opportunity for us to do things our own way.
So, we don't need to start selling our houses just yet.
When I said local, the school is near Glasgow.
That's ridiculous. You know that's impossible for most of us.
  I, for one, will not be kowtowing for a job in the wilds of nowhere.
  Thank you, Grantly.
  Lorraine's coming in at break.
I wanted her to have the opportunity to speak to you. You can ask her questions.
  What about the kids? When do they find out about this?
  Morning assembly.
  Well, good luck. You're going to need it.
  Unbelievable.
  That went well(!)
  What did you expect, Michael?
  You could get banged up for arson or attempted murder.
  Keep your voice down.
I used to look up to you. When you signed up for head boy,
I believed in you and everything you stood for.
You all right, mate? How's your head?
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks, mate.
So what's your outfit like for tonight, then?
All I'm saying is, my dad nearly choked when he saw the price tag.
Josh!
  You're glad I'm back, then.
  Yeah! Who else am I supposed to eye up the talent with?
Cheer up, sir. You're not going to see our ugly mugs for a while.
We're not going to see theirs, either.
Be a lot longer than a while.
Grantly, you give misery a bad name sometimes.
  What you doing in the holidays?
  Dunno.
  A haircut would be a start.
  At least he can cut his hair.
  Shame you can't change your face.
I see you've still got the hots for him.
I don't need a bloke to make me feel good about myself.
Yeah, cos fellas only want you for a visa.
OK, everyone, if you could settle down, please.
Are you all right?
Before I begin, I want you all to know that...
you are the most rewarding pupils I've ever had the good fortune to teach.
Even in the very short space of time that I've been here,
we've faced all manner of challenges together.
But this school has always come through,
thanks to the passion and commitment of its staff
and the spirit of you lot.
Its pupils.
And there's no easy way to say this,
but due to factors beyond my control,
the local authority has decided to close the school.
  What's going to happen to us?
  You'll be placed at alternative schools in the area.
  We don't want to go anywhere else. We want Waterloo Road!
  Yeah!
This place has made us who we are.
I couldn't disagree more.
It's you that have made this place what it is.
You've made it about hard work, about achievement,
about NEVER apologising for who you are.
And you MUST take that ethos along with you.
But you're the one that always said education is a gift to be treasured.
And I still believe that.
You made us a promise, sir. A verbal contract, remember?
We've fulfilled our side of the deal. What about you?
Yeah!
We have to look forwards, not back.
Now, some of you have this prom to look forward to tonight.
I want you all to enjoy it. You've worked hard.
You deserve it.
Enjoy the prom? Talk about a kick in the teeth.
We should cancel it. Well, there's nothing to celebrate.
Are you serious? After all this hard work?
  My sister's education is at stake.
  If you want to be a martyr, that's fine.
  We'll have a prom with or without you.
  Whatever.
Trudi!
Listen, I've spoke to Eugene and I'm out of the gang.
What happened with the fire and that, it was a wake up call.
  Can I have a word with the class?
  Help yourself.
No one's in the mood to learn, anyway.
OK, everyone. Now, the LA has just e mailed me over a list of the proposed school placements.
I just wanted you to know exactly what your options are.
  I'm not leaving you in the lurch.
  Oh, that's good of you, sir(!)
Emily. Seeing as you're nearest. You're in line for Sunningdale High.
That's miles away!
It's going to take me an hour on the bus.
Shona, you'll be there as well. They have a brand new sports hall.
Yes, they burned the last one down.
Well, that's great, cos I'm going to a school full of freaks and pyros!
I can manage here, if you want to go and have a chat with Mr Dixon.
Rhona, you're down for St Jude's.
What? No, you can't split us up, you just can't.
No, right, of course. We can make a case for you.
Come on then, sir. Put me out of my misery.
Phoenix... You're...um...
You are down for...
Ah. You don't seem to be down here.
Well, that's just great.
Talk amongst yourselves. I'll be back in a minute.
Unfortunately, there are only two positions open in your subject.
Oh, well, it was worth asking.
Trouble is, you're top of your pay scale.
Schools are employing junior teachers,
and I'm not sure that you're right for a head of department role.
If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.
Well, we are offering a very attractive voluntary redundancy package.
Well, in this day and age, at any rate.
HE SCOFFS And we will let you know should anything come up.
So, that's a no, then.
We can't just magic a deputy headship out of thin air.
  Yeah, and I can't afford to take such a drastic pay cut.
  I'm sorry.
  What's happening with the student allocations?
  What do you mean?
Not all of them have places. Kids like Phoenix Taylor.
  Granted, his behaviour doesn't look good on paper, but he's flourished.
  Give us time.
It's more difficult to find places for kids with bad track records.
You only get one chance to make a good first impression.
  The school's closing, and you're banging on about collars and cuffs.
  You want to look good for the prom?
Oh, as if anybody would be thick enough to get off with him.
Better late than never. Welcome back, Josh. You're with Lauren.
  Oh, no. No way!
  All right, Finn?
  Who are you?
His worst nightmare. No one leaves the Murray Set unless they're in a box!
No, no, no. Get back! Go and get help!
Oh, come on. I can vouch for these kids.
Yeah, I'm sorry too.
I've had no luck either.
I don't know what else we can do.
If only your new school was here, eh?
  Yeah, unless...
  Unless, what?
  Unless I take them with me.
  Continuity is what these kids need.
  To Scotland? How would that work?
  Live in accommodation.
  Do you think Lorraine would go for it?
Financially, it should be viable, but I'd have to sell it to her.
  Janeece?
  Hiya. Um...do you want anything? Tea? Coffee?
We're both fine, thanks.
Sian, see if you can find some examples for me in the state sector.
  Anything else?
I was just wondering if we could have a chat...about my future.
  Sir, sir!
  Oh, excuse me...
  There's a fight.
Get off! What you trying to...?
  Shut up! Shut up!
  Hey!
Go away!
All right, calm down, son.
Get off me!
  Just calm down.
  Get off me! Get off me!
  Calm down.
This ain't over. Come on!
Right, I need to speak to you two.
  Are you OK?
  Yeah.
The police? No way. Did you see what just happened?
If I grass, they will kill me.
We can protect you,
but Eugene Garvey does not deserve your loyalty. None of them do. Now, give me names.
  I want them charged with trespassing and assault.
  We're lucky none of them had a blade.
I know that, mate. You're going to have to ask someone else, sir.
Any of them have anything to do with the garage fire at the Siddiquis'?
You want Trudi back, right?
Prove it.
It was Paul Marshall and Daniel McKenzie, I don't know the others.
  Will you let the police know?
  Can we go now?
  Yes, but you'll need to make a statement.
You'll have to cancel the prom. We can't guarantee the kids' safety.
I'm sure we can persuade some of the staff to patrol the grounds.
That's not enough. We've locked the gates. It'll be dark, none of the kids will be in school uniform.
We haven't got a cat in hell's chance.
  I'll talk to Trudi, get the events committee onside before we tell the rest of the kids.
  Good luck.
That's it now, innit? They're going to kill me.
  You've done the right thing. You might not realise it now...
  Get off your high horse, Josh.
  Hi.
  How was the journey?
  Too long. Shall we go and break the news?
I think I've beat you to it. The LA forced my hand.
  Oh. Did they want to join us?
  Hmm.
  Not good?
Listen, I'm a black belt in the dark art of persuasion.
  They'll be carrying you aloft by the time I've finished.
  I hope so.
I've never been on benefits in my entire life.
I don't intend to start now.
Oh, I'm sure something will turn up.
How did it go with Mr Dixon?
Promising.
Blimey. Who's that?
  Michael's mysterious benefactor, no doubt.
  Who?
Well, you know he's opening a new school in Scotland and trying to poach the staff?
  Why didn't you say?
  Um, the thing is...
I might have burnt my bridges with him already...somewhat.
Grantly! You're your own worst enemy, you, sometimes.
I will not surrender my principles for any man.
Your principles won't pay my rent, will they?
Seriously, fam, Eugene's lot are already after him. He don't need us on his case too.
Stay away from me.
Shut up, man, and listen. We just want to talk.
  Yo, right. And I'll stick the kettle on(!)
  You've got bigger problems with Finn than us.
Then he's all yours.
Do what you want, no comeback.
  Right(!)
  He torched your dad's garage.
  He's on borrowed time. You get me?
  So, what you going to do?
As far as I can see it, he's on your turf already.
I've got plans for him. I'm going to take care of him tonight at the prom.
We've got company.
  Come.
  Happy hunting!
  For those of you who don't know her, may I introduce Lorraine Donnegan?
  Hi.
I had the privilege of being taught by Michael,
  though I'm not sure the feeling was mutual.
  Bit of a wild child, were you?
Michael's committed. He didn't give up on me.
He inspired me to believe in myself, and it's because of him that I'm where I am today.
I totally believe in his passion for education,
  which is why we want to open this school together.
  Kiss goodbye to bureaucracy.
No more council drones like Alan Dixon telling us how to do our jobs.
An exceptional school requires exceptional teachers.
Take Tom, here. I know you go the extra mile for the kids,
they respect you for your honesty, they open up to you because they know you care.
And you, Matt, for your infectious enthusiasm when it comes to music,
or you, Sian, for your tenacity and ambition for the school.
  Well, you've certainly done your research, I'll give you that.
  This is our chance to raise the bar,
show the rest of them how a school should be run.
I'll be arranging a coach trip north in the next few weeks.
All we're asking at this stage is that you come and check the place out.
I'm sure that you'll see the real potential.
I guess it's an option.
Actually...I'm going to be applying to a school near Martha.
She's growing up really fast. I want to be there.
As long as you know that there's always a place for you with us.
  No, you're an excellent teacher, I'm sorry to lose you.
  Thank you.
What about the kids that we leave behind, the ones that don't have a school place?
Well, we've thought about that.
For those kids who show a commitment to learn but don't have the family support,
we'll be setting up a fully funded boarding house.
  And what does your boss think about that?
  It's...certainly up for discussion.
I'll believe it when I see it.
How many have you got?
Roughly, about ten.
Erm, sorry, everyone. Can I have a word?
It's bad news, I'm afraid.
  The prom   we're going to have to cancel it.
  What? Why?
Well, it's the violence in school today. We can't afford to take any chances.
Nice one, Finn. Way to go, you moron.
It's not my fault! I grassed them up to Mr Byrne.
Look, I'm really sorry. We just haven't got the security.
No, it's all right, sir. We understand.
Are you serious? After all that fuss you made this morning?
  Look, just cos they say we can't don't mean we won't have a party, anyway.
  Where, your house?
No. No, we'll have it here. No one will know, not if the teachers have gone.
That's a shout, you know. We'll invite the whole school, anyone who wants to go.
I mean, we're all leaving now, aren't we?
  What are you looking at?
  Look, you ain't going to get no beef off me.
  You're officially a civilian now.
  Get away from him.
  You what?
  Whatever he's said, it's a setup.
  What are you on?
  I saw you talking to Eugene.
  He's my sworn enemy, fam.
  No, you're up to something, I know you are, I saw you.
Just keep popping them pills, yeah? I mean, seriously?
Will you just drop it, mate?
Right, we're going to need a set of decks, then. Have it!
Sort it, mate. >
Go on, help yourselves. Someone might as well enjoy 'em.
  Ronan, I need your help.
  What's up?
  Take me to where Eugene and his boys chill.
  What do you want him for? He's a psycho. Sorry, I...
  It's fine. Are you going to help?
  What do you want him for?
I need to know that I saw what I saw.
  I need to know what they were talking about.
  You're not making any sense.
  Fine, I'll fill you in, in the van.
  You're asking for trouble.
I'll go on my own.
Josh, wait up!
I'm not saying no. I'm saying you should have asked me.
  But what's the problem?
  There's the legislation, health and safety, the budget.
Michael said your school was for everyone. Why should geography rule them out?
If we say yes to one, how can we turn the rest away?
  Because if we leave them here, it's the end of the road for a lot of them.
  We?
Our first recruit.
I sincerely hope so.
Thank you.
  Listen, let me talk to the accountant, look at the numbers.
  Mm hm.
  Sound fair?
  Yeah.
KNOCK ON DOOR Yeah?
Maggie Croft. Head of catering.
  I'm sorry. I'm just here to deal with the teaching staff.
  I know they're your first concern,
but if you hear of anything going anywhere else...
  No, of course. No problem. I'll take it back with me.
  Thanks.
Have you seen this?
No way.
Kind of makes you feel sorry for him.
Speak for yourself.
His whole life stuffed into plastic bags.
  Not a penny to his name.
  Enough for a few joints, though.
  That stuff's bad news.
  Did the weed bring it on, then? Your...condition?
Schizophrenia. You can say it, you know. It won't bite.
I always had it in me.
  Psychiatrist reckons that weed was the key to the door.
  Come on. Before we catch something.
  So what exactly did Eugene say?
  That we'd got the green light. No comeback.
I think it might be a trap, though.
After the hiding they given Sharkey this morning?
Nah. It's an open goal, bruv.
You'll have no bolts left at this rate.
Do we have to do it tonight? We can do him any time.
Prom's a perfect cover. Loads of people.
  Plenty of witnesses.
  Not if you hit at the right moment.
Look, I'm not going back inside for this.
Your rep's on the line.
What if I say I don't want to do it?
Look at Sharkey's face, then you'll get the idea.
Like I'm going to back out now, fam.
I've got unfinished business. You get me?
Hide it somewhere safe, in case Byrne does a random locker check.
  On top of the bikes sheds should be all right.
  Laters.
  Seen Eugene, boys?
  Nah.
  No worries.
Yes, Phoenix, the prom's back on, don't tell any teachers, but spread the word, yeah?
Thanks, man. Did you hear that? Prom's back on, yeah?
  So, you going to ask Scout, then? Put her out of her misery, hey!
  And mine.
I don't know if she's over that Danilo yet. Maybe later, yeah?
  What am I supposed to wear?
  Who cares? A party's a party.
Nas? You OK?
Them lads aren't going to come anywhere near you or your family ever again, I promise.
All right?
It must have taken a lot of guts, grassing on Eugene.
  Josh helped me see sense.
  Where is he, anyway?
I meant what I said, you know. I'm finished with them muppets.
Will you sign my arm?
There you go.
Do you mean that?
  Where to next?
  I don't know. We've been everywhere I can think of.
  We can't just give up. They were up to something.
  Look, are you sure you saw them talking together?
What? Don't you believe me?
Course I do. Maybe you misread it or something?
You think I'm seeing things.
"Go, quick, call the men in white coats. Josh is having another turn!"
  Eugene doesn't have any of his lads in school except Finn.
  I know what I saw.
  All right, mate.
Hi, Finn.
Sorted, mate.
Hey, prom's back on.
A comeback gig? Yeah, I suppose I could spin the wheels of steel one more time.
Well, well, well. If it isn't the snitch's best mate.
What were you talking about with Tariq?
Finn's grassed, and now the Feds are all over us.
Someone's going to pay. Someone is going to pay big time.
Get him.
  Sian. Sorry, were you wanting to...?
  No, no, just popping in to get my handbag.
Oh, and thank you for the offer, but I have a job lined up.
Yo, Hangman, turn it up.
  Where are you taking me?
  Multistorey car park.
  What? In town?
  On Halliard Street.
It's got a sick view. You get me? Nice and high.
You're going on the naughty step for that one, mate.
Right, let's go.
  Where we going to put these?
  In the girls' bogs. In the cubicle.
  Brains AND beauty.
  One out of two ain't bad.
  Aw, shut up!
  Watch it!
Oh! I spy with my little eye something beginning with rave.
Yeah, Mr Byrne asked us to bring all this stuff up to...
All right. We just wanted to celebrate this place. What's so bad about that?
In here. Mention my name to anyone, I'll hunt you down. OK?
'Where are you taking me?
  'Multistorey car park.
  What? In town?
'On Halliard Street.'
The answer to the final question  
which character coined the phrase "a pound of flesh"?
Shylock.
Right, go on. Get lost.
Go and be brilliant somewhere.
Good luck.
See you later.
Sir, Josh is in trouble. We need to go. Now!
You see that? That's my area.
Everyone knows my name, and everyone fears it.
  Please don't hurt me.
  Know why? Cos I'm a man of deed and I follow through.
  You get me?
  I won't tell anyone, I promise.
Finn's got it coming to him tonight at the prom.
  Only he's not worth my time. So I subcontracted.
  Tariq?
Oi, get off my son.
I said, get off him!
  Long time, Ro. Too good for the estate these days?
  You heard him. Get lost.
Or you'll what? You're going to chuck carrots at me?
This how you get your kicks, is it? Picking on kids? Make you feel better about yourself?
You can't touch me, or you'll lose your job.
I've already lost my job. I'm ready when you are.
No, let's bounce.
Let's see how you get on when you're banged up with proper hard men, eh?
You all right?
Let's get you home.
Come on, excuse me. Just give me a moment, please!
  Come on, sir. Some of us want to get out of here.
  Two minutes. That's all I'm asking for.
  Two minutes that might change your life.
  Is that before or after I die of boredom?
Now, look,
I can't save this school, but we can take some of you with us, if you want to come.
  Yeah, but where?
  Scotland. Come and be a part of something special.
  Seriously, sir?
  Talk to your parents.
We can provide accommodation.
Now, my hope is that the new Waterloo Road won't just be a school,
but that for some of you, it'll become a second home.
One minute 23 seconds. Don't make any judgments now.
Come up to Scotland and see what we have to offer.
I'll be arranging a coach trip over the holidays.
Make your decision then.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Bye.
OK. Bye bye.
Great speech. I think this is the start of something remarkable,
  and I'm really proud to be a part of it.
  Ditto.
  See you in Scotland.
  You're not sticking around?
  No, I'm going before rush hour. I've left you something in the staff room.
See you on the other side.
  Bye.
  Bye.
Hey, guys, what are you up to now?
  Erm...
  Some of us are going to go into town. Maybe a cafe.
OK. Look, I know you're moving back in with your mum,
so I've decided to take the job that Michael's offered me.
  Ah, congratulations!
  Thank you.
  That's wicked.
But I'd still really like to see you guys. Maybe in the holidays?
  Of course, we'll keep in touch.
  Yeah, we can come and visit.
  Great, come here.
  Well, I'll see you back at home. Have fun, OK?
  Bye.
  Bye.
You're lucky I'm not a betting man.
  I thought you would have been first out of those gates.
  Full of surprises, me.
This doesn't have to be it for you.
You know that there's a place for you in Scotland, away from the DSC.
  I ain't a stray who needs a home.
  Yeah, I know that. But the offer's there.
Hush! No noise until we've all gone, OK?
Get in.
Right, in you go, come on, quickly. Um...absolutely no.
  It's my school too.
  Like you ever showed it any respect. Get out of here.
  Right, cheers, sir.
  Not a word, all right?
  Who, me?
  Have fun.
  I will.
  In you go.
Looking good, looking smooth.
  You'll have to let me through a fire door, bruv.
  There's no point, fam. The crossbow, it's gone.
  Since when?
  I dunno. It was there at lunch. I checked. Whatever you paid for it, I'll pay you back.
  You'll just have to find another way.
  Whatever, man. It's your beef.
I'll call you.
Ah, this is very kind of Lorraine, I must say.
Just cos I'm not going doesn't mean I shouldn't have my share.
  So what shall we toast?
  To new beginnings.
  New beginnings!
  I've got an idea. Why don't we all go to the pub?
Shall we go to the pub? Yeah? My round.
Oh, look, a flying pig!
  Very funny. Anyone?
  I might as well.
  By the way, I think we might have found our new housemistress.
  Um...Mr Byrne?
  Ah, Janeece. Before I forget, that's for you.
  What's this?
  Just a small token of my appreciation for all the hard work you've done.
  Thanks.
  Is that music?
  Loosely speaking.
Well, how did they get in?
I might have accidentally let them in.
Ah. Well done.
  It's the first time I've seen Naseem smile all week.
  I'm so sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?
I should have never shut you out.
Do you love me?
What do you think?
Look, sir, we're safe here. All the doors are locked. No one can get in.
We just want to say goodbye.
He's kinda got a point.
Go on, then.
All right?
  Where did you spring from?
  The kitchen, where do you think(?)
Those pans don't scrub themselves, you know.
  Heard this racket all the way down to the kitchens.
  Maggie.
  Yeah?
  I saw on your CV that you used to work in foster care.
A long time ago.
  This new school...
  Yeah?
  We're setting up a boarding house.
Well, I'll need a housemistress. You interested?
You do realise we come as a package.
I go, he goes too.
Well, it'll be a whole new curriculum.
I don't think you could afford me.
If Hardy, Defoe and Dante can't persuade you,
then maybe the relocation package will.
If it's a proper scholar you require, it would be churlish of me to refuse.
Well, that's settled, then.
  Maggie?
  Thank you!
You had me really worried for a minute.
  I wasn't wrong. They were planning something.
  What did Eugene say?
Just said that Tariq was going to get Finn at the prom.
Well, the party's back on. The teachers don't know.
Dad!
Dad! We need to go back to the school. Finn's going to get hurt.
  The prom's been cancelled.
  Was. They've having it anyway.
Right, get in the car.
'I began to see sounds.
'To feel sounds.
'Like waves against my skin.
'I began to hear with my body.
'With my thoughts.
'Have you ever touched a sound?
'Ever seen thunder?
'Do you get so you can look at sounds,
'almost see the waves they make?
'Trembling in the air.
'Trembling in the air.
'Trembling in the air.
'Trembling in the air.'
Don't start this.
I'm happy for you. He loves you. Any fool can see that.
  I'm going to leave the gang, by the way.
  Good.
Just make sure she gets home all right.
What do you want?
I just wanted to see if you wanted to dance.
Yeah. I do, as it goes.
Just not with you.
Come on, girls. Let's go.
Loser.
I'm off.
That's just too funny, that.
Erm...do you want to dance? As mates, obviously.
Nah.
I wouldn't mind a kiss, though.
It's about time you stuck some real music on.
  Country and western?
  Don't knock it till you've tried it. Grantly, where are you?
Go on, cowboy, your cue.
Beautiful. Everybody, join in. We're going to have a hoedown!
One, two, three, four!
  Come on.
  No, no, no.
  We'll slow dance.
  You know I don't...
  You never dance with me.
  No way.
  Come on.
  Help me out! Thanks a lot(!)
Thank you(!)
You ready? Wa a a agh!
Stop it!
  Hey, you look knockout.
  Aw, finally, I got to spend some money after Craig fleeced me.
I just wanted to let my hair down tonight.
It won't open itself.
  Yeah, but I'm not a waitress. I don't need tipping.
  Come on, handsome.
  I can't, I've got a sick note from my mam.
  Come on, let's show 'em how it's done, Chalky Chalk.
  Woo!
Agh! Oh, my God! He's offered me the job!
All right, I take it that's a yes?
I can't wait. I'd better go and get my passport sorted.
  You've got to get out of here, mate.
  I thought we'd sorted this. What's your problem?
  No, look, you don't understand.
  I knew I didn't believe you earlier.
  MUSIC STOPS What you doing?
  There's a crossbow. It's gone.
  Someone, own up. Own up right now.
  What are you talking about?
I think it must be Kyle. He's taken it, he's going after Finn.
  Where is he? Where's Tariq?
  What's going on here, mate?
No!
SCREAMING Josh! Josh!
Somebody call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance now, please!
  Yeah, throw away the key!
  At least I'll get a bed, though.
That's enough!
  That's enough!
  Take him away.
  Hey, what do you think you're playing at? Back there right now!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, sir. I'll tell the police everything about the DSC.
It's all right, Tariq. I'll come with you.
  I'll vouch for you, OK? You did good back there.
  Everybody stand back, please.
How is he, Tom?
He needs stitching up. I just thought for one terrible moment...
I know, I know.
God knows what this is going to do for his confidence.
Well, the offer still stands, you know.
Come to Scotland.
Both of you.
Just have a look around.
I'll think about it.
I should've listened to you.
Forget it.
Nah.
After all you went through, you were there for me.
That means so much.
I love you, man.
Hey, careful. People will start talking.
See you in a bit, yeah?
All in the name of progress, eh?
They'll have their windows smashed within a week.
  How's that arm, Josh?
  Few stitches. Nothing major.
  Good news. Wouldn't want you to miss out on the sports facilities.
  I'll give the archery a miss.
Matching luggage. Must be serious.
  Morning, all.
  Hi.
New wardrobe, Grantly?
I thought a new look, in keeping with a fresh start.
  He helped me carry the bags from the shop, at any rate.
  Yes, well. On y va.
  Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
  Good to see you. Uh uh.
Wait.
  Clean slate.
  Don't mess it up.
Sail
Sail away
Sail away
With you
With you
Stay
Gonna stay
With you...
Does anybody want a drink of water?
Anybody? No?
Excuse me. Are you two coming up for air at some point?
  I'm all right, thanks, miss.
  Me too.
Well, enjoy it while you can, cos there'll be no hanky panky in my boarding house.
Not in their rooms, anyway!
Sir, can we stop at the border, please?
  Well, we're already a bit behind schedule.
  I've never been abroad before.
  I want to send a photo to my nan.
  Come on, five minutes won't hurt.
There you go, sir. It's the button on the right there.
Yes, I think I can manage, thank you.
I cannot wait. Our own little flat.
Together full time.
Ah, come on, budge up, squidge in, everybody. Come on.
I don't know how I feel about living in sin.
Everyone say "cheese".
Cheese!
How does Mrs Budgen sound?
Ah, I'll have to do it again now.
Did you just propose to me?
Did you, sir?
In a manner of speaking.
That's so romantic!
No, hang on, not good enough.
What, and ruin these trousers?
  Yeah.
  Go on!
  All right. All right.
Margaret, would you do me the honour of being my wife?
Aw...
Look out!
