People have been crossing the Monnow River in the Wye Valley for the last past 800 years
using this bridge, and now it's our turn.
Welcome to Flog It! from Monmouth in Wales.
And he's running!
Monnow Bridge, with its impressive gate tower,
is the only surviving mediaeval bridge of its kind in Britain.
Each century has left its mark,
adapting and expanding the bridge and the tower,
so it could serve as a toll house, guard room and even a dwelling.
Today this bridge provides a busy toll free thoroughfare
connecting the outlying areas to Monmouth's centre,
and that's where we need to be.
where creatures can be conjured up in all shapes and sizes.
As you can see, the local people of Monmouth have turned out in force
at today's venue, Monmouth Comprehensive School.
We've got a massive queue, so let's get them inside.
And already delving into the antiques and collectables
are today's experts, Charlie Ross and Mark Stacey,
so, as the crowds flood in, let's jump to the front of the queue
where Mark is ready to pull the strings.
  Hello, Gordon. Hello, Barbara.
  Hello.
  Nice to meet you.
  Nice to meet you.
  You've brought, obviously, a violin in to show us.
  Yes.
Now, tell us a little bit about it.
When our daughter was at primary school she wanted to learn to play
and a neighbour said she had a violin which we could have,
so that's how we came by it.
  It was in a bit of disrepair, so we had to have reglued.
  Right.
But then my daughter had it and played it for a number of years
and then later on, a younger brother took it on.
  Oh, right.
  Yes.
  So, it's had a good bit of family use?
  Oh, yes.
  Yes.
  Yes.
Can you remember what you paid for it with your neighbour?
  I think it was £10.
  £10, gosh. And then a little bit to have it reglued.
  Yes, yes.
  And you got the bow with it as well at the same time.
  Yes, yes, it came with that.
  The nice thing with this, of course, it's signed in the case.
  Yes, yes.
"Stent, 1915",
and a little number four on the left hand bottom of the label,
  so it could be his fourth violin, you never know.
  That's right, yes.
Obviously, you know, we've got the signature
and I think it's always nice to look all over the instrument.
  You get this lovely grain at the back.
  It's beautiful.
And I particularly like the fact, it's nice quality,
because he's done these etched lines really all round the outline there.
I don't know if you've noticed there the black inlay or markings there.
  But it's quite nicely balanced, isn't it?
  Yes, yes.
It's of typical construction of course,
except for this rather nice little finial at the end there,
  which looks a bit like a melon, doesn't it?
  Yes, yes.
  Or a tomato.
  Someone suggested it might be a pomegranate.
It could be a pomegranate actually,
with that sort of seed bit there, it could well be.
  But I like it. I love the fact that you, almost recycled it, really, didn't you?
  Yes.
  The neighbour was about to throw it out.
  Yes.
You recycled it and then your daughter and son had great pleasure out of using it for all those years.
  That's right.
  Where has it lived recently?
  Well, in the loft.
  Oh, dear.
  Yes.
  Stuck up in the loft.
  That's why it's come along to you.
  Come to us today.
  And hopefully we'll strike the right note on it.
  Yes.
In terms of value, it's nice you've got the bow.
  I couldn't see any signatures on the bow.
  No, no.
  But bows are worth a little bit of money in their own right.
  Yes.
I would suggest it may be around £200 to £300 in today's market,
  but put the reserve at 200.
  Yes.
  Right.
With a bit of discretion with the auctioneer, but who knows?
It might go way above that.
  It will be quite exciting, I should think.
  Yes, it will.
  It will be interesting.
  Have you been to auctions before?
  No.
  No, we haven't.
  It'll be your first time?
  Yes.
  Yes.
  We must try it, mustn't we?
  Yes, we must.
  Fantastic.
Jane, it's lovely to meet you.
What I want to know is why is this little piggy going off to market?
Well, he's at home and he's living in a chest of drawers
  and it doesn't seem fair. And I think...
  Why's he in a chest of drawers?
  I've put him up for safekeeping.
  Oh, I see.
I bought him with lots of other bits and pieces...
  How long ago?
  And I liked him. About 20 years ago now.
  I liked him. I liked his little eyes.
  He's got...
  Character.
  He's got the cutest little eyes!
  Yeah.
Do you know anything about him?
  It's German.
  Yeah.
  That's about all.
  That's about all you know.
  Yeah.
  And he still works.
  Yes.
  Do you want to wind him up?
Go on, wind him up, let's watch him play before we talk about him.
  That's great, isn't it? You can hear the rhythm.
  Yes, yeah.
It's a two bar phrase, isn't it? Listen.
Oh, he's stopped. We were trying to play in unison, march together!
We were all marching off to the sale room!
He is beautiful. He really is.
I'm going to pick him up and have a quick look.
I'll take the key out. The thing to look for...
  A typical tin plate toy you can tell by his feet.
  Right.
You can see that. This is sort of pressed die cast metal.
There's the giveaway sign. It says there "Made in Germany".
  Right.
  Made in Germany and there, that's what you're looking for.
  In there, it's very, very hard to see, that says Schuco.
  Right.
Now that's a German toy manufacturer that was founded in 1912
by Heinrich Mueller and Heinrich Schreyer.
OK? And they were very, very successful tinplate toymakers
and they exported to this country and predominantly really to America
right up until the Second World War.
Aww.
Now, I can tell you he has a valuation of around £40 to £60.
  Right.
  One sold recently for £40.
  Right.
  In about the same condition.
  So, that's a good guide price.
  Yes.
He is part of a trio.
  Now, there's a fiddle playing pig who's covered in felt.
  Oh, right!
  And a flautist who's covered in felt.
  Right.
  Now, if you've got the trio together they're worth £200 to £300.
  Right.
I'm hoping someone in the saleroom might have the fiddle player
and they'll pay a lot more than £40 or £50 for him,
because they'll want a little duo.
  So, let's give him a value of £40 to £60.
  Right.
  With a reserve of 40.
  Lovely.
  Are we happy with that?
  I'm happy with that.
  Sure?
  Yes.
Let's wind him up one more time
  and march out with him, shall we?
  Go on, then.
There we go.
It's slowing down now!
Zana, he is super. I love him.
When you brought him along, did you know anything about him?
  I knew a little, that he was an Austrian bronze.
  Yeah.
And obviously I tipped him up and checked on the name.
  Had a look, yes.
  He's just been in the family.
I suspect when you tipped it up, you saw the name Geschuetz.
  That's right, yes.
  Manufactured. Where did he come from?
  He was grandma's.
  Right.
And he sat on her sideboard in the parlour,
but there was another little boy that had his head in his hands
and they both were looking at the little pot,
  which I'm not quite sure...
  At the pot?
  Yes.
And I'm not quite sure quite what was brewing in the pot.
  What do you think?
  I don't know.
Something a little wicked or perhaps coffee.
  Coffee, I think.
  Coffee.
  Don't get too excited.
  OK. Right.
  I think the pot's too big
  and it's traditional Moroccan or whatever shape...
  Yes.
  Or even Middle Eastern shape for a coffee pot.
  Right.
  So, I think we can say coffee...
  Coffee.
  Quite safely.
  Nothing more risque than that.
  Right.
And you're right, it is Austrian. Date?
  Late 19th century.
  Yeah.
  Late 19th century. It's about 1890.
  Right.
Cold cast bronze and hence its weight. It's very heavy.
  Yes, it is heavy, isn't it?
  Yes.
  Yes.
  I'm just going to check underneath.
  Right.
  There we are, it's clear, isn't it?
  Yes. Austrian Geschuetz.
The paintwork is in such good condition.
  It's quite good, isn't it?
  Quite often these have been...
  They've gone out of fashion, been put in boxes with other ones and the paintwork chips.
  Yes.
And if you lose the paint, frankly, you lose a huge amount of the value.
You can repaint it, but you'd never replicate that patination.
No, I understand that.
There's a little bit off the hat, off the fez, but the rest of it is splendid.
  And I love the modelling of the logs.
  The coals.
  The coals.
  Little coals or something.
  The coals and the logs.
I think it's wonderful. Value.
When you were standing in the queue today,
did you think, "Ah, that's worth X, Y, Z?"
  Well, I would have thought over 100.
  Yes.
  But other than that...
Certainly over 100.
  I would put a conservative estimate of 150 to 200 on it.
  Right.
  Yeah.
  I'd like to see it top 200, actually.
  It would be nice.
  It's one of the nicest ones I have seen.
  It would be nice.
We'll put a reserve on it of 150?
  That's fine.
  Happy with that?
  Yes.
  With perhaps a little discretion.
I don't think I'd be disappointed if the auctioneer used his discretion,
which would be a tenner or so either way, because I think there will be...
  Hopefully, there'll be some fierce competition.
  Yes.
  He's lovely. He'll find a new home.
  Yes.
Thank you very much for bringing him along.
We'll see if whoever buys it can find a little companion for him.
That would be nice.
  Hello, Ruth.
  Hello, Mark.
  Nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you.
You've brought a lovely collection of silver in.
Most of it is a family collection?
These four items here were family, part of our family collection of silver.
  And the two napkin rings I bought them fairly recently.
  Where...
  Online.
Oh, you're an internet shopper, are you?
  I'm afraid so.
  It's compulsive.
  It is.
  You want to be careful.
Well, looking at the collection we've got really some very usual things,
but they're nice in their own individual right.
We've got a little continental pillbox,
a little silver matchbox holder,
a little silver bookmark in the form of a trowel
and, as you mentioned, the latest of your purchases,
the pair of Mappin & Webb napkin rings,
which are relatively modern, but a lovely shape
  and have got a good heavy weight.
  Very, very heavy weight.
  But the nicest piece I think is this little box here.
  Yes.
Immediately, you can see it's continental,
because the shape of the piece of furniture it's meant to be imitating, or copying as such,
is a continental piece, probably Dutch.
  So, I would call it an armoire.
  Yes.
Although it's got a little funny saying on the back,
  which I think you've translated.
  Yes, we have.
My friend, Bea, who came along with me today,
she pointed out this means, "This is a new cabinet.
"It is mine, don't take it!" Or something along those lines.
I think it's wonderful. It's a little jokey novelty.
And I think with the type of marks, the style of it,
  I think we're looking at around about 1900.
  Yes.
  Give or take 10 years either way.
  Right, right.
I think it's quite a charming piece
  and that is the sort of thing which would appeal to a box collector.
  Yes.
If I was putting it in for sale,
I think I would put them in as a little group.
  Right.
  But leave the description with the box
and I think as a little collection
  we're probably looking at around about the £150 mark.
  Right.
  Something like that.
And I would suggest putting the estimate straddling that,
so maybe £120 to £180 with a reserve of 120.
  Wonderful.
Well, I'm very, very happy to have put that in for sale for you
and I hope we get you a lot of money and we'll see you at the auction.
  Thank you very much.
  Thank you.
Look at that. That's what we love to see, a very busy valuation day.
We've now found our first items to take off to auction,
so we'll leave you with a quick reminder of what we're flogging.
Gordon and Barbara's daughter no longer plays this violin,
so it's out of the loft and hopefully into new hands.
And Jane's hoping her little piggy will make some noise at auction.
  That's great, isn't it? You can hear the rhythm.
  Yes.
Will Ruth's online purchase pull in a profit
when she combines the silver napkin rings with her family pieces?
And I'm confident Zana's grandmother's bronze
is by Austrian sculptor Franz Bergman.
  Brilliant.
  Oh, my Lord!
  Brilliant.
Right, now's the time to up the tempo.
For today's sale
we've come south to the Athenaeum Auction Rooms here in Cardiff.
Now, I wonder if our experts are going to be on the money.
And we'll soon find out because hammering out the prices
on the rostrum today is auctioneer Ryan Beech.
Ruth's collection of silver is up next.
We've got £120 put on this in value.
It's a good nucleus for somebody to start a collection.
It is and it's a good trade off as well, in fairness,
  which we discussed on the day, but I love that...
  The armoire.
  Dash box.
It's so sweet. Because we led with that
and then we put the other little bits in
  just to make it a bit more exciting and tempting, really.
  Yeah.
  I'd have kept that one bit, I think.
  Yeah.
  It's too late now.
  That's the only bit I would like to keep.
Lot 284 is the Dutch, small Dutch white metal box
and other silver items here. Lot 284.
£75 I have to start. At £75.
At 80. Five. 90. Five.
100. And ten.
120. It takes me out at 120.
The gentleman standing at 120 now. At £120.
Standing at 120. At £120.
  Are we all done, then?
  No bids.
  At £120?
  Thank you.
  You've got to be happy with that.
Yeah, very happy, yes.
I'm going to put it towards something else.
I've started to collect something different now.
Time for the little piggy to go off to market today.
It's that clockwork tin pig which belongs to Jane.
We've got £40 to £60 on this. It's a cute little thing and it does work.
Ryan didn't mention it at all,
  so hopefully he agrees with the valuation...
  Right.
And it's going to sell.
But I know if it doesn't sell, you're not too bothered.
No, no, it can come home with me. I'd be quite happy.
The Schuco automaton in the form of a pig.
£15 I have to start. At £15.
At £15. And 18. 20.
32. 35. 40. It takes me out at 40.
70. 75. At 75.
The gentleman standing at 75 now.
At £75. Are we all done then at £75?
  Oh, well done. Lovely.
  Yeah, that was good, wasn't it?
  It deserved that.
  Yes.
  It was worth it.
It was absolutely charming.
Next up, a short musical interlude. It's the violin.
It belongs to Barbara and Gordon and we've got £200 to £300 on this.
It's cased. It's a cracking example, actually.
I love the headstock, so unusual, and the condition is very good.
  Mark, you've put two to three on this.
  Yes.
And I... I didn't mention anything to the auctioneer,
he hasn't said anything, hopefully he agrees with our valuation.
  I hope so. It's not my usual subject.
  It's not.
I'm a bit blind on this, I'm afraid.
  I might have hit a bum note.
  Ooh!
Well, I... I think we'll get the top end, surely we've got to.
  I hope so.
  That's what I'm hoping.
  So, have you done any more research on it?
  Yes, yes.
We asked the neighbours who sold it to us
and they're telling us that it belonged to a Burt Gutsell,
who was known as Bertini,
and was leader of the ballroom orchestra in Blackpool
during the '20s and '30s.
That's a really nice piece of history.
In the '20s, when it was all happening.
Let's hope we get the top end, and hit the right note.
It's going under the hammer now.
Lot number 535 is a violin.
Lot number 535.
Numerous commission bids here. Start me straight in at...
It's gone quiet.
£230. 230 I have.
  Well, we've sold it.
At £230. 240.
  Fantastic!
At £310. 320, Mike?
£320. Yes, please.
320. 330 with me.
No? OK.
At £330. Back with me at £330. Are we all out then at £330?
  Yes!
  Brilliant!
  That wasn't bad, was it?
  You could say we've ended on a crescendo.
  Brilliant!
Barbara, Gordon, wow!
Yeah, we're very surprised.
You've got to pay the commission. What are you going to do with £300?
  Well, we'll split it up between our three children.
  Yes, yeah.
  It will divide up easily, then.
  Yes.
  It will.
Great result.
I think we hit the right note.
  It wasn't a bum note, Mark.
  That was excellent.
When we talk about investing in antiques we talk about quality, condition and a good maker's name.
This has got the lot. It's a little Austrian cold painted bronze.
It belongs to Zana, not for much longer,
  and the name Bergman will just definitely sell this.
  Great.
It's a cracking little thing.
Charlie, our expert, you fell in love with this.
I did. I think it's fabulous
and the paintwork's pretty good on it, which is good.
I think probably the estimate is a little conservative.
I think it is a little bit.
I had a chat to Ryan the auctioneer before the sale.
A wonderful Bergman bronze.
This has got "come and buy me" written all over it at 150 to 200.
It certainly has. I can see it doubling that.
The quality of it is superb.
Look at the folds of the tunic, the detailing of the face and hands.
It's a lovely quality piece.
I think probably 300 to 400 would be a sensible estimate.
Let's find out what the bidders in Cardiff think of this little Bergman piece. Here we go.
Lot number 577 is the Franz Bergman bronze here, lot 577.
Numerous commission bids here again. Start me straight in at £210.
210 I have to start.
240. It takes me out at 240.
At £240. 250.
  Brilliant.
  Oh, my Lord! 320. 330.
  Three to four.
At £360. Back of the room at 360.
Are we all done, then, at 360?
  Sold! £360.
  That's good, isn't it?
  Yeah, we're happy with the three to four.
  Yes. Great.
You've got to be over the moon with that?
I'm going to buy a Belcher chain to put on a locket of gran's.
Oh, lovely.
Cos it was her grandma's and over the years it's worn,
so I'll put a new chain on it.
That's a nice thing to remember her by.
So it's handed down through oldest daughters, so...
  Then you can pass that on again.
  That's right.
That's the end of our first visit to the auction room today.
We are coming back later on in the show,
but before I go back to the valuation day in Monmouth
I'm going to take a short detour...
to this impressive canopy, 42 square miles of woodland that makes up the Forest of Dean.
This ancient forest was for many centuries owned by the reigning king
or queen of England with the trees being used for fuelling industry.
Since the 1970s this enchanting forest
has been run by the Forestry Commission for leisure and tourism.
Today this enchanting forest has become a great source of inspiration
for many local artists, including the man I'm meeting today.
Clayton Ryder is a sculptor, but he's got more than just artistic interest in the Forest of Dean.
You could say it's in his blood.
  Clayton, it's lovely to meet you.
  Hiya, Paul. It's nice to meet you.
  I think your work is fantastic.
  Thank you very much.
  You're a talented man.
  Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Before we talk about all these, can we take a pew here?
And I just want to know a little bit about your background because I believe you are a true forester.
  I am, yeah. I was born within the hundred of St Briavel's.
  What's that?
That's an old mining term that meant that anybody born within the hundred of St Briavel's
  could work a year and a day down a pit and claim free miners' rates.
  What do you mean by that?
Them mines that are run by foresters born and bred still drawing coal from the forest
and that's the only way that coal is drawn now, through the free mines.
So, obviously your parents were in the mining community.
They were, yeah. On both sides of my family.
My mother's side and my father's side have both...
  Right.
  I went into engineering, following more of my father's side of history, if you like.
  Yeah.
And after working many years as an engineer of redundancies here and there
sort of made me make a decision.
I'd seen these chaps doing the carvings at fairs and shows all around.
So, you make that transition from engineering into...carving.
  Yeah.
  In wood.
  Yeah.
  So, you're obviously very good with your hands, then.
  I don't mind a bit of work with me hands.
We're here at the Heritage Centre at the Forest of Dean, so how did you get involved with this?
Well, I saw a job opportunity come up at the Dean Leisure Centre as a maintenance man.
  Yeah.
  I applied and got this job.
I've been here now for... This is my fourth year.
So, I work five days of the week as the site manager here and then on weekends we get on with the carving.
  And you certainly have become a big attraction, haven't you?
  Yeah, yeah.
People from all over the country come here to see you work.
  They do, yeah. They do.
  Well, I want to talk about your technique
because I know you don't use traditional carving tools
like hammers and chisels and gougers, do you?
No, not at all. I just use a chainsaw.
  Just literally a chainsaw?
  Yeah, nothing else.
Everything I do is chainsaw started and chainsaw finished.
And you... Did you start all those years ago with a chainsaw or did you actually do it traditionally?
No, I've never been traditionally trained. I'm self taught. It's just the chainsaw, me and a bit of wood.
So what's the biggest thing you've ever carved? What was it?
That was a dragon and it was 22 feet long.
  Wow!
  About four feet across, 22 feet long out of copper beech.
  And where's that now?
  That's in the Forest of Dean.
  Oh, is it?
  Yeah. It's in a private residence.
It came down in the garden and I carved it where it fell.
I've got to say, on the show we see a lot of carvings of
  20th century Black Forest bears, you know the ones, so high?
  Yeah.
Behind you we've got a Forest of Dean carving of a bear, which is full size virtually!
  Yeah.
  How long did that take?
  It took about 12 hours.
  About 12 hours working on it.
  It's no wonder you use a chainsaw!
  Well, that's it.
I can get the finish that I require and the timber requires with a chainsaw.
The finish you've got is typical of the chip carving we see on the Black Forest work.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Are we going to get a demonstration?
  You are, yeah.
  Is it going to be loud?
  It'll be loud for them that's close!
  What will you carve? What are you going to do?
  I'm not going to tell you. I'm going to surprise you.
  Oh, OK. Am I sitting on it or are you sitting on it?
  No, it's over there.
  How long do you need?
  It should be done in a couple of hours.
A couple of hours. OK, all right, then.
In the 1960s, chainsaw dealers in America competed to promote their products
at forestry expos and state fairs, so they carved simple sculptural shapes.
What started as a gimmick lead to a movement of artists who experimented with chainsaw carving.
While Clayton gets on with his carving, I went to have a look
at another important role he plays here in keeping an ancient tradition alive.
For approximately 2,500 years, since the Celts settled within its boundaries, the valuable minerals
of iron ore, coal and stone that lie beneath this forest floor have been extensively mined.
To produce iron you need one important ingredient.
It's charcoal and it's been produced in this forest since 450 BC
and with Clayton's help it still goes on today.
Clayton organises three burns a year at the Heritage Centre.
He carefully stacks lengths of wood over a pit.
This is covered with turf or soil.
Charcoal embers are dropped into the central hole and the stack burns for four days.
When the smoke pouring out of the vents changes from white to blue the burn is complete.
Well, I can still hear the chainsaw.
I wonder how Clayton is getting on.
He's a busy man and time's running out to complete that sculpture,
but before we see the results, there's another industry that's left its mark on this forest.
The early 19th century saw Clayton's ancestors heading underground.
Thousands of men and boys working in the mines that run deep underneath these trees.
The last big mine closed in 1965,
but mining continues on a much smaller scale carried out by the Dean Free Miners,
local foresters like Clayton who still have the right to mine in this forest.
Well, I know I'm a bit early, but I heard the chainsaw stop, so let's see if Clayton's finished.
  Masking it! Hiya, mate.
  All right, buddy?
  Yeah.
That was quick.
  Aye, quick enough.
  And that is fantastic.
Isn't that amazing?
  So quick!
  Just over an hour.
A wonderful bird of prey.
I love the beak! God, could you imagine just going wrong at the last minute and knocking the beak off?
Where did you start on that? Just talk me through the process of getting a block
and then getting that from a solid block?
I worked out where his back was going to be,
  so it's just a straight cut down the back.
  Yeah.
Tilt the head slightly so then it's two... Two cuts to get either side of the head.
  So you've shaped the head that way.
  Yeah.
  Then cut in for the breast?
Yeah. Shape the wings in, cut the feathers in.
  Feet last?
  Yeah. Easy as that.
As easy as that! I think it's brilliant.
These could be the next collectables of the future.
We'll see these turning up on Flog It! in 20 years.
  That would be nice, wouldn't it?
  Do you do many private commissions or is a lot of this charity work?
It's mostly charity work because I work for the museum.
Anything we can raise goes towards the charity of the museum, because the museum, being a charity,
  we raise what we can for it.
  Yeah, and they're doing such a cracking job here.
  Yeah, yeah.
  It's a pleasure to meet you.
  And you, mate.
  You're very talented man.
  Thank you very much.
The people here at the Dean Heritage Centre are working tremendously hard
to celebrate and preserve this forest's rich history
and the continued use of fallen trees like these by people like Clayton
to make works of art bring that long history bang up to date.
Out of the woods and back at the valuation tables
is true forester Jean and she's brought in an interesting collection that caught Charlie's eye.
Jean, lovely to see you. Where have these medals been hiding?
They have been in a wardrobe for about 30 years in a box.
Oh, have they? And you've had them all that time?
  Yeah.
  And what made you pull them out today?
  I decided I'd have to declutter a little bit, yeah.
Can you tell me anything about them?
I know very little except they belonged to my late husband's father.
  You're late husband's father.
  Who was in the navy.
  Who was in the navy.
Well, hence this wonderful volume entitled
World Cruises Of The British Special Service Squadron, '23 to '24.
And these important warships
that took part in the war subsequently, in the '39, '45 war
went on a world cruise and this shows where they went and which the ships were.
Right, the ships Hood, Repulse, Delhi,
Danae, Dragon, Dauntless,
HMAS Adelaide, Australian ship, and that's where they went all round the world.
Now, the first one I think's interesting, the Hood,
very, very famous ship which had a very, very famous and tragic ending.
Now, did you say...
  I believe he served on it.
  He served on the Hood?
  I believe he did, yeah.
  He survived the war?
  Yeah.
He obviously wasn't on the Hood in, I don't know whether it was 1940 or '41
because the Hood and the Repulse were sent out to get the Bismarck.
I don't know if you've ever seen the film Sink The Bismarck!
  Yes, I have, yes.
  Kenneth More at his best.
And the Hood, which was the pride of the British fleet,
engaged the Bismarck
and one shell...
I mean, it's just extraordinary, one shell from the Bismarck
hit the Hood, went down the funnel and went into the magazine.
  Right.
  And blew the whole ship up.
And there were four survivors.
Four survivors, so he obviously wasn't on that day, thank God.
But that's the trip they did.
There is HMS Hood, battle cruiser, big ship.
Eight 15 inch guns, nothing compared with the Bismarck, sadly,
but a big ship and an important ship.
Then if we just flick through to here, here's one of the places.
They went to New Zealand.
There are some wonderful Maori pictures here.
It was a sort of PR exercise, really,
for Britain and the Royal Navy to go round the world.
  It's a history of the world in one album, really.
  That's right.
And in super condition.
Coming on to the medals, they're all General Service.
  They're not medals for valour.
  No.
The nearest we've got to that is the long service medal, naval medal.
Beautiful medal. Beautifully produced. These are general service medals.
The Atlantic, he obviously served in the Atlantic,
and you got a medal if you served in the Atlantic.
Served in Italy, the Italy Star
and that's the general '39, '45 star,
and that is the General Service Medal, so they tell a story...
  A story.
  Of somebody that was through the war.
  Do you've any idea what it might be worth?
  Not really, no.
  I've no idea.
  The medal here, the long service medal, is worth
These are worth a few pounds each, a few pounds for this.
I think £50 to £100 would be a sensible valuation...
  ..with a reserve at the bottom end and I think there'll be sufficient interest hopefully
  to knock it up towards the top end.
  OK, thank you.
  Hello, Don.
  Hello there.
Now, I don't think we've had one of these on Flog It! before.
This is a silver castle topped card case. Have you had it long?
I bought it very early '60s.
  Oh, right.
  I bought one piece of silver each month as savings,
and four years after I'd bought this, the dealer rang me up
and offered me four, five times what I'd paid for it.
  Good Lord!
  And I thought, "Oh, I've struck gold!"
and I slung it in the drawer and thought no more about it.
  And what did you pay for it?
Gosh. That was quite a lot of money back then, wasn't it, actually?
Well, it was. It was to us. You know, £96 was like a month's wages.
  To a struggling farmer.
  That's it, you've got it.
Well, it's very interesting. I mean, these are quite well known pieces.
  I mean, they made a lot of them in the early Victorian period.
  Yeah, yeah.
And there are several makers of them and the value, it very much lies in the rarity of the subject.
  Yes.
  Well, I think this one actually is Winchester Cathedral.
  Oh, that's interesting. I did think it was Canterbury.
  No, I don't... I don't think it's Canterbury.
  But...
  Oh, that's interesting.
You've got the best maker.
This is made by Nathaniel Mills, who was a specialist maker of small silver objects
  in the early part of the 19th century and he was based in Birmingham.
  Oh, Birmingham.
So, we've got, you know, the right maker,
we've got an interesting item in the fact that it's Winchester
and the date letter is for 1843, so it's early Victorian.
Oh, good.
But we do have a slight problem.
We have this sort of nasty dent in the back here. But that's not too bad.
Somebody will be able to slip something in there.
A good silversmith would push that one out.
Yes, I would have thought so. So, to value.
Ideally, I think, we would put something like 1,000 to 1,500
on this, but you're a canny Welsh farmer, aren't you?
Well, struggle isn't the word these days.
  So, you've forced me up.
  I know.
And we're going to agree to put a £1,200 to £1,500 estimate on it.
  Well, there you go.
  With a 1,200 reserve.
  That sounds about right.
  I think it's got a chance.
  Yeah, yeah, well... Be nice.
We'll see you at the auction and let's hope we're toasting your success.
  Let's hope Mother Luck shines on us.
  Absolutely.
  That would be good. Thank you.
Bronwyn, first of all, happy birthday to you!
  Thank you very much.
  Celebrating you birthday with a trip to Flog It!
  That's right, yes.
  And then anything planned?
  Lunch after.
  Lunch.
  Yes, with the family.
  With the family.
  Yes.
  How many family members?
  Oh, crikey! We'd better get a move on, then!
  Yes, please.
  Have you ever worn this?
  No.
  You don't like it, do you?
  No, I don't.
  I can tell.
  No, I don't like it.
  How long have you had it for?
  Oh, I should think about 20 years now, but it was my aunt's.
  Right.
And when she died, it was given to me.
Right. So, it's been sitting in a box somewhere, presumably?
  Yes, actually in the teapot, yeah.
  Right.
  Yes.
  Do you know how old it is?
  No idea.
Right.
It's first half of the 20th century.
1920s, 1930s, I think.
  Do you know where it comes from?
  No, no, I know nothing at all about it.
Well, looking at all those stones
I think probably what is now Sri Lanka, what was Ceylon.
  Oh, right, yes.
  All these stones are
readily available there.
From the left here   and forgive me if I forget, I'm not a gemmologist  
  but we have got a citrine.
  Right.
  Then a garnet.
  Yes.
  Then a smoky quartz.
  Oh, right.
Then really a rather splendid sapphire, big, deep cut sapphire.
They cut it quite deeply so as to draw as much colour as possible.
  Oh, right.
  Yeah.
Then we've got a cabochon amethyst.
By cabochon, not cut, it's rounded.
It's in the form really of a bead.
  Yes.
  Amethyst.
Then we've got the zircon.
  Right.
  And then, although it's a slightly different colour,
  we've got another garnet at the end.
  Oh, right.
Garnets come in different shades of orangey red.
So, it's a nice
collection of stones.
It's set in silver.
Sadly, not gold or platinum.
  No.
  So it's...
It's not as precious as it might be, so we can't attach much value to the actual bracelet itself.
  Have you had it insured?
  No.
  No.
No, I didn't think it was worth anything.
  You didn't think it was worth anything. Did you think it was a bit of costume jewellery?
  Yes.
So, you thought that was worth £10, I suppose.
  I didn't think it was worth anything at all.
  Anything at all!
  No.
  So, it will come as a pleasant surprise to be told that it's worth £100 to £150.
  Lovely, yes.
And I would suggest a discretionary reserve at the bottom end of the estimate.
  Right.
  So, we'll put 100 to 150.
If we have... Give the auctioneer a little bit of discretion, which means
basically if he gets bid perhaps £90 and that's the last bid, sell it.
  Yes.
  You're happy with that?
  Yes, thank you very much.
Well, we'll see if we can turn it into some serious birthday money.
  Well, thank you.
  Thank you, Bronwyn.
  Lovely.
Let me remind you who's off to auction and what items they're pinning their hopes on.
Jean's nautical collection is rich in historical value.
  It's a history of the world in one album, really.
  That's right.
But will it translate into cash?
Don has high hopes for the card case. Despite only costing £96,
he's pushed Mark to a healthy £1,200 to £1,500 estimate.
And completing the trio is Bronwyn.
Celebrating your birthday with a trip to Flog It!
That's right, yes.
Will her bracelet bring happy tidings at the auction?
  Nice.
  This is more like it.
So, it's back to Cardiff where Ryan is raring to go.
  Next up, Jean's photograph album of the warships and the medals.
  That's right.
Have you been looking forward to this?
  I have, very much so.
  Got your lucky earrings on...
  I certainly have!
  You told me earlier.
  Yes.
  You put £50 on this, but I'm hoping it'll double that.
  It might do.
  50 to 100 we'll say.
  Yeah.
You just no longer look at these and...
No, it's been in the wardrobe.
  You just might as well get rid of them.
  Might as well get rid of them.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Well, look, good luck.
  I hope so, anyway.
  You look so smart. Thank you.
From the Forest of Dean, look at this!
A group of World War II medals together with the book,
the World Cruise Of British Special Service Squadron, lot 150.
Good luck, Jean. This is it.
Commission bids. Start me at £50. 50 I have.
  Oh, straight in!
  Oh, yes.
  60. Five. 70. Five. 80.
Five. 90. Five.
  100. And 10. At 110.
The gentleman standing at 110.
Now at £110. Standing at 110. 120.
Oh, there's a bit of a fight on for it.
At £150. The gentleman standing at 150, now. At £150.
Are we all out in the room at 150?
  That's more like it. Yes!
  I'm pleased.
  That's good.
That's brilliant, isn't it?
That's good, isn't it?
  The earrings... The earrings worked!
  The earrings did it!
  Didn't they?
We've heard this name on the show before now, Nathaniel Mills.
He's a Birmingham silversmith, but we haven't seen his maker's mark
on something so exquisite before as this.
It's a castle top card case and it belongs to Don, who's right here.
  Well...
  He's getting rather excited because you're not going to own this much longer.
Well, it's a nice piece.
We don't mind if it stays here or goes home with me, but...
This isn't going home with you!
  Well, we'll see.
  This is going to fly out the sale room.
  You paid how much this?
OK. Well, we've got an estimate of £1,200 to £1,500 with a fixed reserve at £1,200
because you don't want it to go for a penny less because you've been offered 1,000, haven't you?
That's correct.
  Lot number 330 is an early Victorian...
  Good luck.
..silver castle top card case by Nathaniel Mills. Lot number 330.
  Love it, love it, love it.
  At £780 I have to start. £780.
At £780. 800 is there anywhere?
800. And 20. 850. 880. 900. And 20.
950. 980. 1,000. And 50.
  At 1,050. Back with me at 1,050.
  Oh!
  I don't think it's going to sell here.
  At 1,050. At £1,050.
Are we all done, then, at £1,050?
  It's not going.
  No, I don't think it will.
I shouldn't have opened my big mouth, should I?
But, I tell you what, you protected it with a reserve of £1,200,
so whatever I said it's not going to sell if the bidders aren't going to put their hand up.
  Well...
  But I'm pleased.
Do you know that I'm pleased? Because it is worth more than £1,200.
  Well...
  I don't think the right people were here.
No, I mean, to be honest, I think on the day we did have a big discussion about this and an ideal estimate
I think would have been 800 to 1,200. But, you know, if you like it so much, you've got to protect it.
  Yes.
  Well, it's a very pretty piece.
  Yes, it is.
  Yeah.
We're only a few lots away.
Bronwyn's little Sri Lankan multi gem bracelet.
So, will we get the top end?
  Middle end.
  Middle.
Oh, really! OK!
Let's find out, OK? Hopefully, we'll get the top end.
  This is it.
  Seven stone bracelet set with semiprecious stones here.
£65 I have to start. £65.
At £65. And 70 is there anywhere?
At 65. 70. Five. 80. Five.
  The lady over there's bidding on this.
It takes me out at 100. At 110. 120.
  Oh!
  Nice.
  This is more like it!
  Oh, they love it.
  Oh, crumbs!
  And were still going!
At £400.
With the lady at 400 now. At £400.
  Oh, gosh!
  Wonderful.
Shoot the valuer!
Well, I don't know, Charlie, it's a hard thing to put a price on.
  Yeah, yeah. It was very pretty.
  Gosh.
But I didn't think it was £400 worth.
No. I thought it was costume jewellery!
Gosh! There's commission to pay here.
  Yes.
  Deduct that.
  Yes.
  It's around 16%, plus the VAT, that's lots of spending money.
  It is lovely, isn't it?
  Yeah. What are you going to do with it?
Well, my husband told me to buy some jewellery that I liked!
  Buy some jewellery you liked!
  Yeah.
Well, that's it. It's all over.
Ryan's still up there weaving his magic, but all our owners have gone home happy.
We've had a cracking day here, plenty of surprises, and I hope you've enjoyed today's show.
So, from Cardiff, it's cheerio.
