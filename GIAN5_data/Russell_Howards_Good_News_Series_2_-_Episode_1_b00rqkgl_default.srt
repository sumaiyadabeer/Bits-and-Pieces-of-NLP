Welcome to Good News. Every week I'll be scouring the news for weird
and wonderful stories to make you laugh. So, what does reporter John
Craig want for his birthday? couple of He cannot lie. But what
does he want those butts to do? I'm pretty sure someone spiked Glenn
Beck's coffee. I love it when reporters lose it. Staying and
doing nothing is as he knows as doing nothing at all. Isn't that
great   he's got the same face as a naughty toddler. Did you see Bill
Clinton talking about his penis surgery. There has been and 88 %
reduction. Why the reduction, Jeremy? Literally Sharrock doubt.
My favourite clip of the week has to be this. With me is the
organiser who I presume has a made  up name. Made up name? No, my dad
was a bastion. So obviously the big political story of the year will be
the general election. But who to vote for? Everywhere I go, people
say the same thing to me. Who are you? Jesus   have you seen his
skin? The man is so wrinkle free I bet his scrotum looks like Amanda
Holden's forehead. God bless the Tories, they genuinely thought this
poster would bring success. We disagreed. We took one look at it
Or you could go for Gordon Brown. The poor man's face looks like
Eeyore has had a prolapse. They are always trying to make him smile.
Don't. A smile doesn't belong on his face. It's like seeing Marilyn
Manson on a bouncy castle. He really needs to ease up on using
the word good. You got a job today? Congratulations. When do you start?
Next week. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. And they are being good
to you here, are they? That is good. Did you see the recent Brown and
Cameron interviews? Yeah you gave him a battering. Do you have your
own private toilet? Slam. So childish. Do you have special poo
place? The questions got even tougher. When was last time you
went to a supermarket? Have you ever been a plonker? It's so vapid.
And what's frustrating. Brown could have won the nation so easily just
by going... "Piers can you stop talking for a minute because every
time you open your mouth I can smell Simon Cowell's dick." It
wasn't just Gordon. Cameron faced the wrath of another media heavy
weight. 4th X factor or Strictly Come Dancing was to mark Coronation
Street or EastEnders? He gave him a pounding. Scotch egg for a face or
sausages for fingers? It's so inane. What's Nick Clegg gonna do, go on
Loose Women? How big's your willy? When's the last time you did it?
Blondes or brunettes? I tell you, he'd win my vote if he went on
their with a hammer. But then that's just me to be honest, I'd
vote for any of them that shot this If they have been some strange
goings on in the animal kingdom. think cats have it in for us.
cat seems to have an uncanny knack for predicting when patients are
about to die. A cat that predicts death, wow! Mind just likes to lick
his own bottom. The other day I woke up with him on my face,
terrifying. I thought I had gone down on and Robinson. That is no
What I want to know   how does Oscar predict their deaths? Are
there other cats going, "fancy going through the bins?" "In a
minute... Pneumonia, cancer, stranglewank." Good day to you!
cats roam free. He has been involved in the last 25 deaths we
have had here on the unit. Involved? They make him sound like
a super villain. Sat their in a swivel chair just stroking a human.
You're going to die, isn't that right Sebastian? Yes! He curls up
just like this, only on the birds of patients who were are a couple
of hours before passing. Sidles up to old people and then they die.
Who was he in a previous life, this guy? You wouldn't want your grandad
living here. Imagine the frantic phone calls. What's wrong, Grandad?
I gotta go, there's some killer pussy in my room. Ethel? He will
only go to patients who are about to dive.    dive. Imagine living
there... lock off! lock off! lock off! I'd be smearing everyone's
pyjamas with Kitekat. They make out like this cat is magical cos he can
predict death. He lives in a Hospice   people go there to die.
In Ohio there have been reports of bears in people's gardens. The best
thing about this story is how they convey the sheer terror of seeing a
black bear in your garden. If you look closely, that's not actually a
real bear. He can even climb trees. Thought blackbirds country on the
ground, or they can even climb trees. It's so brilliantly chit.
Mind you, it isn't just in America that the animals have gone wild.
Even here in Britain we're under siege. He jumps up at people and
tries to peck them. It goes for you with its beak and claws. Oh my God.
What kind of beast is this? weeks now, a pheasant has been
terrorising... Terrorizing. What's he doing? Throwing his eggs? You
looking at my plumage, you bender. He had a knife. I think he was on
drugs. I shouldn't really joke, I saw one in my garden last week. So
  evil cats, fake bears, terrorizing pheasants. You're
probably thinking you can't top that. Guess again. A feisty Raku
and has bitten off a pervert's penis.... As he was trying to rape
the animal. I've been drunk in my time. I've been horny. I've never
looked at a rodent and thought, "I'm gonna tap that bitch". Russia
and plastic surgeons are trying to restore his mangled man hold.
told this story to my mate, do you Wouldn't it be hilarious if he was
waiting in casualty and this programme came on. Come to think of
it, his rod probably looks like Cyril Sneer's nose. Bloggers have
been outraged. To be honest, I'm with this guy. Arthur he didn't
even videotape it. Now, did you see this? Did you see the mobile phone
This was the A1 in Yorkshire. Incredibly, nobody was hurt and
even more incredibly I've got There's been loads of bizarre
stories this week. Have you seen what the National Trust have been
up to? They are so proud of their fresh air, the National Trust has
gathered hundreds of jars of the stuff and taking it to London to
impress the stressed out city population. They're giving away
jars of country air to stressed city workers. I'd love to see that.
Country air   mmmmm incest! Mmmm casual racism! Mmmmm dogging! Have
you seen the experts discussing it? If you look closely I think she
might be sniffing her hair. You can smell spring and summer coming, and
it is a very peaceful place whatever the weather. What I don't
get   how can you relieve stress with a jar of air? It is going to
be mental mate. Mental mental, Yes, this is the incredible story
reported in the Ssun that... Driver wins 2 million 24 hours after
divorce. Kevin is determined not to let the money changed him. He will
be back driving his boss from Preston to Bolton. Not going to
change him   imagine him driving the bus. The wheels on the bus go
wherever they want. I am and millionaire. Why do they always say
it will never change me? I want to see them buying mad stuff. I want
him to say first things first I will get my dog gold teeth, then
give him a boob job. Then get my Don't you just love it when people
celebrate properly. Neither of them have won. The winner was... Yes!
Somebody very happy, apologies if you manage to pick that up.
Obviously extremely happy. He might need a police escort on the way
home. Am sure there are other people and the pub filling the same
Lots of bizarre education stories about. Did you see this school in
Australia? A school has found itself surrounded by bottles and
sex shops. The Education Department admits there is nothing it can do.
Incredible. I tell you what the kids will never forget the day they
lost their virginity   cos they'll have a receipt. Sex shops outside a
school? What did we have? Imagine, school assembly, the kids talking
about their field trips. "We went to Tina's tit pit. And we saw all
sorts of klunge. My favourite person was a lady called Destiny
but I am not sure she understand the rules of ping pong" And it's
This is my favourite bit of the news Coverage. There are 5 massage
parlours, five addle bookshops. you've just shown the kids exactly
where they are. Australians are pretty dirty. They have no computer
games look sexual. Help me. Delaney to... A here it comes! Nice!
Talking of sex great news for underage players. Condoms for 12 
year old boys go on sale in Switzerland. Jonnies for 12 year 
olds? What are they going to do? Flavour them? Mmm, Ribena. That's
right, Babydoll   and it's tooth kind. Are they going to put
cartoons on them? "Oi darling. Let's see if you can Find Nemo.
There he is, he's gone again. There he is, he's gone again". Look out
How are they going to buy them? Ask an adult? I tell you it's going to
be a brave man that struts into a shop and goes a packet of your
finest child sized condoms, please. outside, and he's ready to go. But
this isn't the weirdest sheath story of the week   there's talk of
JLS bringing out a condom! You are going to promote your own brand? I
read that in the papers so I have to ask. Obviously it is large.
Extra large? Not really, anyone can get fit the letters JLS on their
wang. It's not as if it's Englebert Humperdink! Christ! You'd need a
rod like ET's finger. Celebrity condoms are a nightmare. I tried
the Luke Skywalker one   rubbish   my nob glowed green and I tried to
flag my sister. JLS Condoms? What next? Robert Pattison on Tampons?
Get in there you'll love it you vampire Son of a Bitch. You'll

Did you see the quote from the Chief Exorcist. At times the devil
makes fun of me. How? Do you reckon he's on the floor praying and a
voice goes, not the first time you've been on your knees. Gobble
gobble. Just floating porn mags in the air, woooh. Actually they're
priests, so it's probably kids shoes. If you're offended by that
joke, it wasn't me, it was the Now, sometimes it's hard to know
what's going on in a baby's head. Are they bored? Are they surprised?
I was sat down narrow and next to Fred. Or are they angry? Well worry
no more because the iPhone's come up trumps. It is called to try   
cry translator. You open the application, Old Vic near your baby.
Press start and it will begin to analyse your baby's cry.    holding
the baby. Do we really want to know what babies are thinking? They
haven't developed social skills. What if they're really rude. The
kid goes WAA! The iPhone goes 'Oi Tits here, now!' You heard me  
floppers out now! Yes Dad? Problem? What if they are surprisingly
profound? Why are you crying? And the iPhone goes, "Because Mother
it's 2010. And the world is still living in crippling poverty. And
I've soiled myself." Maybe the translator isn't a good idea. That
said I would love to know what these babies were thinking I think

You think the baby translator is strange   look at this invention
from Sweden. Clothes that play music when touched. You're probably
thinking great idea   I'm a walking disco! Wrong. What if you're
walking past a kid's playground and suddenly. I'm horny. Out of
nowhere a funeral procession goes by... A bloke walks past with a
guide dog. I can see clearly now the You're
outside a Shelter for Abused Wives. Now the biggest story in sport at
the moment is definitely this. Beckham has suffered an injury.
you describe this what you saw? Achilles tendon snapped. He will
not recover in time to play in South Africa. There has been
worldwide hysteria but every man in Britain went, "Phew thank God it
wasn't Rooney." Watching Rooney at the moment is like watching Bambi
walk across a minefield. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Don't get
hurt. Oh he's made it! So Beckham won't be playing, but all is not
lost. He might be at but he could be going to the World Cup. Fabio
Capello has asked him to travel with the squad. Not playing and
still going all that way. Surely he will get bored. Lonely... I am so
lonely. It is a great idea, use him for
his pants and sits with their wags all right girls. Or failing that he
could play his wife's music outside their hotel. Ahh! It's sounds like
a fox locking a bagpipe. Or you could get a fox to do that. Watch
me control the animals. That would really change spring watch. Not
everyone's concerned with Beckham's injury. Arsene Wenger's still
struggling with Hollyoaks. It is difficult to understand it
Did you hear the cheer across the country last week? Good news if you
struggle at the gym and like a kebab. It seems a certain Miss
Cheryl Cole has had it with Did you hear that massive cheer across the
next Girls Aloud concert. A load of fat men dancing next to teenage
girls. It'll be like Thailand. Wouldn't it be great if Cheryl
starts cruising buffets, you've had three plates. Put the rest in a
doggy bag and get in my van. In the back there's loads of fat men like
that. Just full of pies. Eat up my pretties, you'll need it when you
get back to Cheryl's love palace. I just can't wait to see her next
If you have never seen the programme before I like to show you
a story that makes you feel better about the world. Here it is.
When Philippe suffered a stroke after his premature birth doctors
feared he faced the rest of his life in a wheelchair. That
prediction seemed ominously accurate until the arrival of an
unlikely source of inspiration. This duck is getting the credit for
