Tonight on Newsnight Scotland: As gas continues to leak from the
Elgin plant in the North Sea, it emerges that the platform's Blair
is still alight. Is there a serious danger of an explosion?    flair.
Is renewable energy seriously the future for Scotland's future?
Staff have been evacuated but Gas continues to lead from the Elgin
platform 150 miles off the coast of Aberdeen. Tonight, the operator
all gas. Coastguards have set up an exclusion zone. While there is a
not the case, Total have said that it could take six weeks.
Staff were evacuated safety. The danger is of pollution of the sea
and air and the potential of an explosion. The problem developed
under the Elgin platform. It involved a well which was put up
one year ago and workers were in the process of killing it off. The
fault occurred at the reservoir. Gas should travel to the surface
through this central pipe. But it leaked to the outer casings,
platform, shrouding the area in gas. Coastguards have imposed an
inclusion zone    exclusion zone of two miles for shipping and three
platform because of the drifting gas. We could be looking at a Piper
Alpha scenario. On the positive side, everyone is home and save on
the source. Total say they have yet to confirm the source of the leak,
but have activated their pollution emergency plan. Tonight, it emerges
that a flame at the platform is still burning, raising the
possibility that it could ignite the gas if the wind changes
direction. Gas is mainly methane. It is very flammable. The flair is
still alight on the main a production platform, but the wind
is blowing the gas plume in the opposite direction, away from the
flame. We know the weather forecasts are such that the wind
direction remains the same for the following five or six days, and we
are evaluating options to extinguish this plane. Last year,
Shell came in for criticism for failing to share information after
the oil spill from this platform. Total have been warned they should
not make the same mistake. Last week, BP got approval for well in
the deep waters west of Shetland. The difficulties in dealing with
this leak will raise further questions about the wisdom of
exploration in even deeper seas. Our correspondent is in Aberdeen.
What do we know about this plane? The first I knew was this evening.
I have interviewed David, who use or twice. I asked him at one.
Whether there was any risk of an explosion and he told me that all
the power was isolated, so there were no sources of isolation. He
went on to say he could not promise that it would not ignite but they
had done everything possible to minimise that risk. Maybe I should
have asked him if the fleck was still going. There was no mention
from Total of that until this evening. They have said that the
gas cloud is much lower than the flame and that the wind is blowing
the cloud away from the platform, and eventually, Total says, the
flame that will extinguish itself. Do we have any more clarity on what
Total might try to do to stop this leak? There seem to be three
options they are working on. They say they have experts from all over
the world, including their Paris headquarters, are working on it. It
is unprecedented in the North Sea. The first option, they hope, is
that the gas will stop digging itself. That seems to be a real
hope at the moment.    stop leaking. They thought they had closed the
well by packing it down to stop the gas from producing. The third
option, which will take at least six months, is to drill a relief
well. That would be similar to the one that eventually stemmed the
flow of oil and gas from the grid in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.
is not really safe to put anyone on this platform, is it? No. The gas
is a mixture of five hydrochloride so, Hydro sulphide, methane and
carbon dioxide. It is very flammable. The thing that surprises
me is why they have put an air exclusion zone to try to avoid the
risk of a commission from the air. There is also the see exclusion
zone.    risk of ignition. There has been a lot of criticism of oil
companies in the past for not being open enough. You alluded to this
already. I think the unions are annoyed about this, as well. How
have you found dealing with Total on this? You asked the question so
I will answer it. We should never show the roads of our dealings
within    with companies and ourselves. Companies like to
control information. You may remember last year when there was a
leak at a platform owned by Shell, Shell were eventually accused of
downplaying the incident. They had to say that they should perhaps
have been more transparent at the start. They do not like bad
publicity. They have tried to work it over the years but Total's way
of dealing with it in recent days would seem to be putting out a few
press your leases    press releases, very repetitive, and we have had to
rely on information from other sources. The RMT say that they are
at a loss as to why it is still flaring. They hope the wind does
not change. Thanks very much. I am joined by Dr Simon Boxall from
the Department of Oceanography at Southampton University. Some pretty
obvious questions, if I could, about the conditions there. This
gas cloud that is supposedly surrounding this rig   we have been
told it is flammable. What happens if something ignites that? Does it
explode, go on fire or what? Both of the gases are infallible. They
are both very toxic, as well.    inflammable. The first I heard that
Beith Laird was still going was an hour ago and it was news to me.   
the earth Laird was still going. Having shut down the electoral
systems, having this great flame going.    electrical systems. It
means that the source is always there to ignite the gas, should the
wind change. Should it plain that connect with gas, what happens?
will explode. It doesn't just go on fire, it is an explosion? It is a
fairly volatile explosion. The damage that would cause to the oil
rig would mean that the whole issue of trying to cover of the other
banks coming out... Up there all kinds of big issues. It goes from
being a minor incident, relatively straightforward, to being a fairly
major incident if the reader does blow. What are the implications of
the fact that we are told we have this methane mix bubbling or
boiling through the water? I have heard suggestions that the EC could
set on fire if it was ignited,    the ocean. And that this could
affect the buoyancy of boats. in the immediate vicinity of the
oil rig itself. What does that mean? If you have air bubbles
underneath the boat so, the boat relies on air bubbles holding the
water up. The boat would no longer be supported by the Dem    dense
water. There are incidents of boats being hit by methane bubbles from
the sea bed, naturally occurring ones, which have caused boats to
sink. It is not unheard of but it is only an issue in the immediate
vicinity of the oil rig itself. It adds to the dangers they face when
they try to tackle this but the question is, is it bubbling through
the sea? One storey we hear from Total is that the gas is being
released just below the week in air.    the oil rig. But we hear reports
about the c Boiling, which implies that there is gas coming up through
the seat from the sea bed. The big issue then becomes the pollution
and if you have hydrogen sulphide coming into contact with water,
that is going to cause quite high toxic effects to marine life. The
methane itself will break down fairly quickly but the hydrogen
sulphide is the thing that could potentially cause an environmental
problem. I am curious as to whether you think there is a common theme
here. It is less than a week since BP was given permission to do deep 
water drilling to the west of Shetland. Although this was not in
deep water, this was a very high  tech field. It is the highest
pressure, highest temperature field in the North Sea. Are these things,
do you think, happening because we A we're pushing the boundaries of
what we can do. We're on the edge of technology in terms of dealing
with extreme environments. That is because we are running out of oil
from the normal environments, the standard sources of oil, Texas oil
fields, on land or in shallow water, are fast disappearing. An hour
hunger for fuel, we are being pushed to more extremes, D Lotter,
the Arctic, deep gas.    deep water. Today, Scottish Renewables have
released a report saying that the renewable energy industry is going
to give another 1000 jobs. Is the picture all rose? Perhaps not. It
has been dubbed by its supporters the second industrial revolution,
but will Scotland pursued of green energy unleashed the green eyed
monster again in years to come? Alex Salmond certainly hope so,
having nailed his colours to the renewable mast. The first minister
wants to generate the equivalent of 100% cut the country's electricity
by renewable means by 2020. Central to that are people like Richard,
who has spent the last 13 years developing and commercialising a
generator capable of harnessing wage power. We get a third of the
renewable    of electricity from renewables anyway, and that speaks
for itself. The industry is delivering. His is exceeding
targets. That is a world leading position. None of the measures by
which the renewable sector will be judged is its ability to create
employment. Today, Scottish Renewables released figures that,
at present, it supports more than 11,000 jobs. The majority are in
the supply chains linked to product design and development. It is a
significant number, and one which Scottish Renewables say could
increase quickly in the coming years. That is, if the sector
continues to receive support. A Spanish company last year announced
a multi million pound investment in a wind turbine manufacturing plant
to be based in Leith in Edinburgh. It was trumpeted as a sign of
things to come. A we have set up a stable, growing industry, which is
the bedrock of creating and sustaining jobs. We have seen some
boom bust industry in the US, which have not delivered at a sustainable
employment industry.    and plundered in the industry. In
Scotland, you are saying the opposite. That is why be commenced
   big companies are coming here. For many, renewable energy provoked
scepticism. Where wind farms are involved, even outright hostility.
There's a lot of nonsense about windmills, they are horrible
looking structures, they make noise, the kill birds by the thousands,
there really destructive... Donald Trump believes that a proposed
offshore wind farm would spoil the view from his north east golf
development. Other proponents    other opponents have arguments
which run deeper. The do not deliver, they're unreliable, they
are driving up household energy builds for everybody, they are
hugely subsidised. Britain has amongst the highest subsidies for
wind energy anywhere in the world, and this is not government subsidy,
this is not coming from the taxpayer, this is passed down the
line by the energy companies directly to the consumers. Will
Scotland energy future be the envy of the world? It is a debate that,
in itself, will generate plenty of heat. The Royal Academy of
Engineering have been debating the future of energy in Scotland. I
enjoyed by Dr Simon Harrison of Mott MacDonald and Dame Sue Ion,
the former director of technology at British Nuclear Fuels. Dame Sue
Ion, do think we're in danger of over hyping renewables? The debate
this evening has shown it is not as simple argument and that one of the
issues ahead is the Engineering challenge to deliver what is
required in the renewable sector, whether it be offshore wind
particularly, or the wave energy and its ability to be truly
commercialised and a truly commercial marine environment, that
has still to be proven. Dr Simon Harrison, there is an issue that,
with renewables, everyone talks about the technology and very few
talk about the cost? The yes, there are cost issues with renewable
energy. If we are to diversify, there are significant cost with the
competing options as well, so we would be talking about gas fired
power stations fitted with carbon capture storage, or nuclear plants
south of the border supplying power into Scotland. The accost problems
with all the options.    there are cost problems. Do you agree with
that, Dame Sue Ion? I do, the cost of electricity is going to rise.
There is no simple answer. Some of the renewable technologies are
other more expensive end of the spectrum. But Simon Harrison's
point is that, if you're going to diversify energy, everything will
cost more. Is there any evidence that the renewable policy that the
Scottish government is pursuing and things like wave and tide and wind
is any more expensive than the next generation of nuclear power
stations? When you look at all the analysis, the nuclear option would
be the more cost effective. Recent studies in the European Commission
have published that and demonstrated that clearly. Simon
Harrison, being parochial about this, of Scotland has a problem, it
is not just this idea about having lots of winter bites, the idea that
Scotland could re industrialise itself as an industry, they areas
where Scotland has a technical lead, things like wave and tide, not only
are they and their infancy, I wonder if they will ever be on the
scale that say, onshore and offshore wind is becoming?
issue will be about producing something cost effective and seeing
it as part of a balanced portfolio, those technologies have different
generation characteristics, different predictability levels to
some of the other renewables. The future is likely to be about Amex.
Scotland is well placed to take advantage of the intellectual
capital developed for those technologies, as well as some
others, such as carbon Capture and storage. Is there an elephant in
the room here? If we forget about nuclear and the cost compared to
renewables, could we be on the verge of a whole new world of
hydrocarbons? There have been huge new discoveries of oil in places
like Brazil and the attack    and the Arctic, there is Canadian shiel
oil, there is an argument that the world's on the brink of seeing a
to it, to pay extra for renewables rather than get more cheap oil?
There are a number of elements to the argument, some of which are
associated with climate change, and security of supply is, as well as
the cost element. Although gas may become more available due to shield
gas, we still have to look at the environmental implications of
pursuing that road and if we're going to do her job for the Earth,
and a climate change cents, we have to look at carbon sequestration,
which is not yet proven and industrialise, and all that will
have a cost element which will meet the fossil fuels not quite as
attractive as you otherwise would have thought. So badly, we will
have to leave it there. Thank you both very much indeed for joining
us.    sadly. Tomorrow's front I am going to have to readers of
the screen. This is the thing that you saw on Newsnight, probably.
That is all we have time for More warm sunshine to come on
Wednesday. First thing, it will be chilly. Temperatures falling away
quite sharply. Across northern Scotland, there will be more cloud.
The sunshine will lift the temperatures in rural England. It
afternoon, we will be up at 20 degrees Celsius. A little bit
cooler on the coast. Essentially, a beautiful, spring day. A similar
picture in Northern Ireland. Parts of the South may exceed the March
record for Northern Ireland, which burn the stands at 21.7 degrees
Celsius.    which currently stands there. An increasing amount of
cloud for the rest of the week. There will be plenty of sunshine in
