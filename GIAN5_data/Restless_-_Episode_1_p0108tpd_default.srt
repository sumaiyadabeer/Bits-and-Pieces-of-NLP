This programme contains some strong language.
She knows too well that she's the only one
She doesn't care if you're the lonely one.
Jochen. Don't make yourself sick. You'll have to walk home.
Mummy?
Yes.
Is Sally your real mummy?
Of course. Why do you ask?
It's just she's so strange.
Well, we're all strange when you come to think about it.
I'm strange, you're strange.
Oi, what are you doing? You stupid woman!
Be careful, Jochen.
Sally?
We're here.
Sally! We're here!
Mum...?
Mum? Sally...?
Ruth!
My God, what's happened?
What's with the wheelchair?
I fell and hurt my back. Doctor said not to overdo the walking.
Did anybody follow you?
No. What are you talking about? Follow us?
Hello, darling.
Hello!
How's the thesis going?
Slowly but surely.
Wouldn't a job be better?
I'll get a better job with a PhD.
A PhD on Anarchist Politics in Post War Germany?
A PhD is a PhD.
A PhD is a route to getting a job.
Who says I want a job?
How's Jochen getting on?
He's fine. Likes his school.
I'm trying to say, in my clumsy way,
isn't it not too much for you?
Cambridge University thesis, teaching foreign students,
on your own with a young boy?
We're fine, Sal. Don't worry.
We're happy.
Doesn't he miss his father?
Karl Heinz has a right to see him whenever he wants.
Well, as long as I agree.
  So... Hadn't you better tell me?
  What?
What's with this wheelchair lark?
Things are going on...
What things are going on?
There are people in the woods.
Yes, ramblers. People walking their dogs.
  People out for a walk.
  People who are watching me.
You need to see a doctor.
All right, all right. I'm sorry.
But you must admit I have good cause.
I'll give you good cause.
What's this?
Read it, you'll see.
Who the hell is Eva Delectorskaya?
I am.
No. No, you're not. You're my mother.
You're Sally Gilmartin.
I am Eva Delectorskaya.
Contre nous de la tyrannie,
L'etendard sanglant est leve
Entendez vous dans les campagnes...
Eva!
Eva.
I'm sorry. What can I say?
Only 40 minutes late. You're getting better, Kolia.
Father's medicine. There was a queue.
  Enormous. Kilometres long.
  Of course there was.
I've got to run. I'll see you tomorrow.
I thought we were having lunch?
Eva. Eva, Eva, always nagging.
  Where are you running off to?
  A meeting.
What kind of meeting?
A meeting kind of meeting. Don't worry, big sister.
  Well, be careful!
  I'll be fine!
Et nous disons aux etrangers qui decident de vivre chez nous.
Vous etes comme les Juifs et les Francmacons.
  Vive la France!
  Vive la France!
Qu'est ce que se passe! Hey!
Je suis journaliste!
Allons y.
Really, darling, you didn't need to drive all this way...
Stop right there! You, Eva, or whoever you are,
have just described a young man being horribly kicked to death
by a bunch of fascist thugs!
This Kolia you say is my uncle. Was my uncle.
  He was!
  How do you think that makes me feel?
Me! Ruth Gilmartin, as was! Your daughter!
Reading something like that. How do I know what to believe?
Believe it. It's the truth.
But why now, Sal, after all this time?
I don't get it.
What's Dad's memorial service got to do with anything?
Somebody saw that photo. I knew they would.
It's the Cambridge News and Herald, Mum, for God's sake.
They see everything!
Because then I noticed the people in the woods,
the new cars in the village. They'd found me.
Or thought they had.
Then I realised I had to do something. I need your help.
I just don't believe it.
It's happening. It's true.
Suddenly I'm half Russian?
Yes. Yes, you are.
Mademoiselle Delectorskaya?
Monsieur! S'il vous plait?
Pourquoi vous me suivez, monsieur?
Forgive me, I didn't mean to frighten you.
I wondered if I might have a moment of your time.
How did you know my brother?
My name's Lucas Romer. I was a friend of Kolia's.
  I saw you the day he died.
  Yes. Yes, I met with him.
You heard what happened? Robbed and killed.
Actually, I think he was murdered.
I think they took his wallet to make it look like a robbery but...
I'm afraid he was killed by fascists.
What are you talking about? He was a piano teacher.
He was...
Oh. Of course.
Your English is excellent, by the way. Hardly any accent.
Please.
We had an English governess in the old days.
In Russia, before we came to Paris.
"Lucas Romer. Managing director. AAS." What does that mean?
Actuarial and Accountancy Services.
  You're an accountant?
  Please. Miss Delectorskaya,
I just wanted to express my condolences.
I've been looking for the right moment.
My deepest sympathy.
Well... Thank you.
Goodbye.
  Hello?
  Ruth.
Hello, Mum.
How are you getting on? Where've you got to?
I've stopped. I don't think I can take much more.
Keep going, darling.. You'll see exactly why I need you.
Mum?
Mum!
Papa?
What are you doing?
Hello, my dear. Will you join us in a drink?
Papa. What is he doing...?
I've been having a most interesting conversation with your father.
Mr Romer says I can be British citizen.
  We can both be British citizen, Eva.
  Papa!
I go prepare our supper. Huh? All right?
  This intrusion is completely...
  I'll explain.
I work for the British Government.
Please, leave, my father's not well! This kind of excitement is not...
The security services. Kolia was one of us.
He was infiltrating and reporting on fascist organizations in France.
Why are you telling me all of this?
Perhaps we should go for a walk.
But I don't understand.
Why would Kolia join the British Secret Service? It's not like him.
Because there's a war coming. Yes, a war with Germany.
This year, next year. It's just a matter of time,
but for some of us, it's already started.
Kolia was fighting in that war. Think of him as a soldier.
Don't let him have died in vain.
This has nothing to do with me. How can I believe you?
You could tell me anything.
Why would I go to all this trouble just to lie to you?
My brother is dead, that is all I know. It's all I care about.
Perhaps you'll believe me now.
What is this? Some kind of joke?
You're a British citizen. Your name is Eve Dalton.
You work for us,
you'll earn £500 a year and get your father into hospital.
The best treatment.
Don't let Kolia have died in vain.
You can do something to avenge his death. Think of Kolia.
I do. Every minute of the day.
Keep your secret war, Mr Romer. If it killed my brother,
  I want nothing to do with it.
  Just think about it.
Think what we can do for your father.
  Do you still have my card?
  What? I think so, yes.
Call me on that number.
That won't be necessary, Mr Romer. I've made up my mind.
  Good day.
  Kolia asked me to ask you!
Eva, he wanted you to join us!
It was his dearest wish!
Thank you.
Feeling calmer now?
How can I feel calm?
I can't get my head around it.
You're a British spy called Eva Delectorskaya.
That was my name.
Well, go on then. Say something in Russian!
Oh, my God. What does that mean?
I was saying my daughter is a headstrong young woman
who sometimes makes mistakes.
Did Dad know anything?
No. He didn't.
We were very happy together. That's all that mattered.
Don't look so perplexed, my love. We all have secrets. Everyone.
No one knows even half the truth about anybody else.
Not even when we're very close.
You went off to Germany for two years, lived in a commune.
Had a baby and didn't tell me about it for months, did you?
And then suddenly, "Oh, I met a man in Berlin called Karl Heinz,
"who happens to be my professor,
"and, oh, you have a grandson called Jochen."
That's not the same. I was in a different situation.
That's all I'm doing.
Telling you my secrets, that's all.
Excuse me?
  Yes, Miss.
  Where exactly are we?
Somewhere between Edinburgh and Inverness, Miss.
Miss Dalton?
Welcome to Lyne Manor. I'm Gerald Laird.
I'm the director here.
I was on the phone to Lucas Romer this morning.
I think he's very pleased you changed your mind.
What's going on here? A house party?
No, no! What were you expecting?
Barracks, a camp... A parade ground.
No, no! We have entirely different methods of training here.
We want you to be efficient and enjoy yourself.
  What kind of training?
  It's not what you expect.
  It's very precise.
  Very particular.
We concentrate on very specific things...now we're at war.
We'll get you started in the morning.
You have one minute.
Just the very slightest emphasis. It can convey so much.
Let's try it again. You can't possibly be serious.
You can't possibly be serious.
Almost. Just a squidgin more. Once again.
You can't possibly be serious.
Arizona, Phoenix. Arkansas, Little Rock.
California, Sacramento. Colorado, Denver.
Connecticut, Hartford. Delaware, Dover.
Florida, Tallahassee. Georgia, Atlanta. Hawaii, Honolulu,
Idaho, Boise. Illinois, Springfield. Indiana, Indianapolis.
Iowa, Des Moines...
Ready.
There were no dustbins... Sorry, trashcans outside number 10.
The car in front of number seven had white wall tyres.
  ..Andrew Johnson, Ulysses Grant, Rutherford Hayes...
  Stop.
Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to a partition of Poland
following their respective invasions of the country.
The city of Warsaw has surrendered to German forces
as of yesterday evening, And the British Prime Minister,
the Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain...
All right?
Count to 100, please, Miss.
You're the last. Good luck!
First one home, Miss Dalton!
Always full of surprises.
Bravo, Miss Dalton.
Thank you.
Edward? Have you received your weapons training?
Eva, you really shouldn't be asking me that, you know.
Of course. Sorry.
  Sergeant?
  Yes, Miss Dalton.
When am I due to have my firearms training?
Let me see...
Ah. You're not to receive any firearms training, Miss Dalton.
  Funny that.
  Are you sure?
Everyone else seems to be trained how to use a gun.
That's what it says down here, Miss. Mr Romer says it's not necessary.
Oh...
Paper! Get your paper!
Paper, please.
Taxi!
Come along, don't dawdle, ladies. Come along.
We're going to Drumnadrochit.
Excuse me, can I get to Arthur's Seat from Princes Street?
I was told it took about an hour.
Eva. Congratulations.
The red scarf was a masterstroke. Do you like oysters?
How big was the team following you? Four?
  Six, actually.
  Not many people can beat a six man follow.
  Not even sure I could...
  I'll take that as a compliment.
  It is, except you forgot about the close follow.
  The close follow?
I was never more than three or four yards from you.
You expect a crow to be following you at a safe distance,
but sometimes crows are on your heels.
Worth bearing in mind. Still, bravo!
I meant to ask, why did I not receive any weapons training?
You won't need weapons in your line of work.
But what if I'm in mortal danger?
Well, it's most unlikely, But if you find yourself in mortal danger,
then use your intuition. Use your animal instincts.
You always have your nails and your teeth.
There's two more identities.
What for?
Lily Fitzroy and Margery Allerdice.
What are these for?
I was getting quite used to being Eve Dalton.
Everyone who works for me is given three identities.
In the Actuarial and Accounting Services, Limited.
Exactly, think of it as a perk, a bonus.
Might need them some day, might be handy. One other thing.
At some point soon, I'd like you to find yourself a safe house.
In London, or another big city. Don't tell anyone. Not even me.
I'll bear it in mind.
It's something I encourage all my operatives to do. One of my tips.
Ah yes. One of Romer's Rules.
  Are there many?
  Lots.
But I'll tell you the most important.
Never trust anyone. Ever.
Maybe the only rule you need. Especially not me.
I'd never trust you.
You learn quickly, Miss Dalton.
Thank you, Mr Romer.
Eva Delectorskaya. Who'd have thought?
People are very...pleased with you.
Very.
You ever been to Belgium?
Yes. Yes, I went to Brussels once. For a weekend.
Why?
It's where you're going to be working.
Training's over, you see.
Stakes are raised, massively.
All change. It's real now.
Merci.
Just Spain and Portugal for that one, Alfie.
Let's see what our Spanish news agencies make of this lot.
They do like our war news, the Spaniards.
I think Sylvia's got something for me as well.
Our very own Queen of lies.
Morning, Eve. Make way, make way, cripple approaching!
Morning, Angus. Is Romer in?
His Imperial Majesty has gone to London, so I'm informed.
Morgen, liebchen. Svenska Posten.
They picked up your drowned sailors' story.
"Islandsk fiskebat gick pa en mina utanfoer Narvik. 40 omkomna."
The Swedish nation stirs... Gold star for Eve.
Good God, that was fast. I can never get used to it.
That went out as item number ten on a news bulletin
on a local French radio station, what, three days ago?
  And now this...
  It's what we trade in, isn't it?
Lovely stories, so compelling.
Dream it up. Dress it up.
Send it out into the big wide world to stand on its own two feet.
Might drop this in to Alfie. News just broken.
Three new bridges to be built across the River Yser.
Now that is smart. That's where you're one jump ahead of me.
  Is it really happening?
  Maybe, who knows?
But three lovely new bridges, why not?
You know, make the Wehrmacht staff officers start altering their maps.
  You are devious, Sylvia.
  Yes, I confess,
I'm a very devious woman, I must say.
Morning, sweetheart. Looking lovely today.
  You got Sylvia's press release?
  Here we are.
  Morning, Eve.
  Angus tells me Romer's in London.
I think he was summoned away.
Fancy a spot of lunch?
No. You are doing well. Romer will be very pleased.
Why is Romer in London?
"Ours not to reason why..."
Probably talking to Mr X.
Who is Mr X?
Mr X is our esteemed boss's boss.
A kind of Cardinal Richelieu figure
who allows Lucas Romer to do more or less as he pleases.
Have you known Romer long?
Well... A good few years, now.
Always in AAS?
Sorry. Curiosity killed the cat.
Shall we be very naughty and have a brandy?
Yes, let's!
Ah, there you are, naughty girl.
We were wondering what had happened to you.
Oh. My God, bit of a shock.
You're late.
Did you buy something to drink? I'm gasping.
Ah, yes, wine, wine, wine. Perfect. I'll open that.
I did some shopping on the way back.
  Thought I was off duty.
  You're never off duty.
Yes, sir.
Pack an overnight bag. You and I are going on a little trip.
  Oh, are we going to London?
  Sorry.
A little town in Holland, actually.
Holland. Little town, right.
Sorry. Must have nodded off.
Sweet dreams?
No, not really.
Actually, I was dreaming about Kolia...
  Do you want me to take over?
  We're nearly there.
  Prenslo?
  That's where we're going.
  What's important about Prenslo?
  It's on the border with Germany.
We're perfectly safe. Holland is neutral, remember?
I had heard. Just like the good old US of A.
  Why do you say that?
  It's true, isn't it?
I had to do all that American stuff at Lyne.
I couldn't understand why.
  You've never been to America, have you?
  No.
Are we going to go into Germany?
No, but a German is coming to us.
A Wehrmacht general is defecting.
I have a feeling this meeting is a direct result
  of our stories from the Agency.
  Score one for the AAS.
You'd think so, but we're not going to get the credit.
Our Head of Station from Holland, a very pompous fellow called Fowler,
has decided he wants to meet this general.
Coming in to Prenslo personally to bring him in.
Claim it's all his doing, I feel it in my bones.
I know these people. Dead wood.
No, I just want to get the true story.
Let him know we're on the case also.
A defecting German officer. Very exciting isn't it?
On the contrary, it's just routine.
We're not here to participate, just watch.
Come in.
Come and have a look. How's your room   all right?
Fine. Yes.
The meeting is in that cafe.
So there will be two British SIS officers there,
Fowler and his number two, and a Dutch agent.
A staff car will come through from the German side
some point between one and three o'clock this afternoon.
What do I do?
Go down there, have a long lunch and wait for our German defector.
Watch, note. You're my eyes and ears.
I want you to make yourself known to the Dutch agent
before the German comes across.
Make sure Fowler and his man doesn't see you.
  You know the passwords?
  Yes, yes.
  "Have you fire? French Cigarettes. The Hague."
  Just stay alert.
I need to know absolutely everything that happens.
Every tiny little thing. No matter how insignificant. Right?
It was what I was trained for.
Let's see if it worked.
I'll be up here, watching.
Ein koffie, alstublieft.
  Do you speak English?
  Yes.
  Have you any fire?
Thank you. Do you know where I can buy any French cigarettes?
You could try Amsterdam.
Of course, thank you so much.
'I need to know every tiny little thing. No matter how insignificant.'
'Do you speak English?
'Every tiny little thing. No matter how insignificant.
'You're my eyes and ears.'
You could try Amsterdam.
Lucas? It's me.
Lucas?
Romer?
Hello, yes, I'm looking for Mr Romer. He checked in this morning.
He's gone? Where...?
I see. When did he leave?
30 minutes ago. Thank you. No, no, no, that's all.
Hello, yes, I need a number in Belgium, please.
Ostend. 4721.
Hello? Agence Nadal? I have a story about a windmill.
The windmill is black.
Eve? Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
We thought you might have been taken. Or even...
No, no. I'm fine. Number one is gone.
We've heard nothing from number one.
He reported the incident, then nothing.
There's no trace of him. I'm here alone in the hotel.
That's normal procedure. He would have aborted immediately.
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Make your way back here as soon as you can.
Take a bus.
Yes. All right.
All right.
  Tag!
  Tag!
  Careful!
  Hiya.
  See you later. Bye, Jochen.
  Bye!
Come on, boys.
Yes. It arrived on Monday.
The Franchi PA7 with five cartridge magazine.
They do make nice looking guns, the Italians.
I want 4BB lead shot, not steel.
Yes, fine.
There you are.
Thank you. Special licence?
Yes. ID. This is your primary address, is, it Mrs Gilmartin?
  Rose Cottage, Middleashton?
  Yes.
This will fell a bull elephant.
Yes.
My cottage backs on to this wood, you see.
The foxes keep coming for my hens.
Ah, foxes, right.
It will be £275 and 50 pence.
Yes, I know, thank you.
  What the fuck is going on, Mum?
  Oh, hello, darling.
  I'm buying a shotgun.
  Good hunting, Mrs Gilmartin.
Thank you so much. Bag.
  Goodbye.
  Bye.
I think we need to have a proper talk.
SHE COCKS THE SHOTGUN Jesus! Do you mind?
  This is madness, you know.
  I feel safer now.
Makes all the difference. I can sleep.
When you call in future, I want you to ring three times, then hang up,
then call back, then I'll know it's you.
We must be careful what we say to each other.
Are you saying the phone is tapped?
It's entirely possible.
And when you drive here,
I want you to take a little diversion each time,
make sure no one's following you.
What's this all about, Mum?
The war's been over for 30 years, for God's sake.
Why're you carrying on with all this cloak and dagger stuff?
Someone is going to try and kill me very soon.
Oh, come on. Don't be ridiculous.
I need you!
I need you to do something for me.
What?
Well, you see, there's only one person who can help me.
After all this time. Only one.
Who?
  Lucas Romer.
  Is he still alive?
How would I know how to find him?
You could ask your supervisor. You said he knows everyone.
Bobby von Arnim?
Well, he's pretty well connected, I suppose.
Particularly if there's some sort of World War II involvement.
Why Lucas Romer?
He's the only one I can trust.
He's the only one that can help.
  Splash of water?
  Yes, please. Gallons of water.
Well, I suppose it was too much
to hope for a new chapter of your fascinating thesis,
but it's a delight to see you, Ruth Gilmartin,
for whatever reason.
Beggars can't be choosers. My day is made.
  My week is made. Prost.
  Cheers.
So, any luck with the elusive Lucas Romer?
Well, I've found somebody who... Who might fit the bill.
He's very discreet, this Romer fellow of yours.
Who's Who, Debrett's... Nothing at all. However,
there's a certain Baron Mansfield of Hampton Cleeve,
a crossbencher in the House of Lords who might be him.
War years a total blank.
But he does admit to a Croix de Guerre from Belgium.
  Must be a clue.
  How would I get to see him?
You want to meet him? Why?
I've some questions for him.
You want to be a little careful, my dear.
Really? Why?
Because I suspect your Lord Romer was a spy.
A spy? Nonsense.
The various noticeable gaps in the information always give it away.
Then the obscure foreign decoration, no home address given.
Why do you want to know about Lucas Romer?
Just, you know, helping an old friend trying to track him down.
Used to work with him in some organization called AAS Ltd.
AAS? How do you know about that?
Nobody knows about AAS.
  This friend mentioned it.
  Can I meet this friend of yours?
I'd be most interested to ask a few questions.
  I doubt it. I don't think she...
  She?
Even more interesting.
Look, you were going to tell me how to meet this Romer.
Well, with these people, the only thing to do is flatter them.
Say you're writing a piece for The Times. No, The Telegraph.
That usually flushes them out.
Look, I'd better go.
Do be careful, my dear Ruth.
These people are...
Let's say, you'll never know what you uncover once you lift the lid.
  Good morning.
  Good morning.
Everything all right?
Well, wasn't in the sunniest of moods.
Something's up, but he wasn't saying.
What exactly did you say to him?
I said, "Do you know where I can buy some French cigarettes?'
Exactly those words?
  I think so.
  Thinking's not good enough, Eva.
You need to be absolutely precise.
  We lost two British agents in Prenslo.
  Sorry.
That's what I said.
What did he say?
He said, "You could try Amsterdam,"
but he should have said, "The Hague".
Why are we going through all of this again?
I made it clear in my report. How many times do I have to...
C wants to talk to you about Prenslo.
  C? My God. Why me?
  It's your evidence that's vital.
Very important you get it right, Eva.
The future of AAS is on the line.
Everything we've created here, everything we've been trying to do
with our elegant and misleading stories.
When does he want to see me?
In about one hour.
Why are we meeting in a hotel?
They love meeting in hotels.
90% of intelligence meetings take place in hotels.
Just tell them everything you told me. Be completely honest.
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but.
Well, there's rather a lot at stake.
A big new operation for us.
I have a feeling how you come across this morning will...
Well, it'll have a bearing on it all.
Right. Under no pressure at all, then.
Take a seat. They'll call you when they're ready.
  Good luck.
  Where are you going?
I'm off to the pub to have a drink.
I'll come and get you when you're finished.
  Break a leg.
  Thanks.
Miss Dalton.
  ..we need to concentrate on.
  I do suggest that you ask these...
Miss Dalton, thank you for your patience.
The double password. Who gave you the details?
Mr Romer.
You're certain you heard it correctly?
Yes.
Why a double password?
We routinely use double passwords.
We?
The team. Those of us who that work under Mr Romer.
How would you describe Lt Joseph's response to your second question,
"Do you know where I can buy French cigarettes?"
I don't understand.
Was his voice flat? Nervous? Casual? Knowing? Professional?
Yes, I see. No, I would say, absolutely, that he thought
he was giving me the correct answer to the second password.
Excuse me.
What were you yourself doing in Cafe Backus that day?
It was Mr Romer's idea.
I was there to observe what happened
and to make myself known to the Dutch agent.
It was entirely Mr Romer's idea.
Yes.
I was simply to observe.
Thank you very much, Miss Dalton. You may go.
Please   wait outside.
Well done. Excellent.
What did I do?
Take the rest of the day off. You deserve it.
Right. Thanks.
No, let's have supper. Soho. Frith Street.
There's an Italian restaurant called Luigi's. I'll see you there at 8.
  I'm afraid I'm can't...
  Nonsense.
We're celebrating. See you at 8. I'd better get back.
Yes, I keep getting post for lodgers who moved out months ago.
No forwarding addresses. What can I do? That's the war for you.
This is the rent for the next six months.
I won't expect you'll see much of me
but I just like to keep my London base safe and sound.
If only all my ladies were like you, Miss Fitzroy. I'd have no complaints.
I only come here for the Chianti. Best Chianti in London.
Aren't we at war with Italy?
We mustn't let the war interfere with our pleasures.
There seems to be an endless supply of the stuff, I must say.
Here's to head office. They'll be paying the bill.
No, here's to you, Eva. You did very well today.
Bravo   "brava", rather. You saved our bacon.
Thank you.
Was the full board of directors there today?
Almost.
Was "X" there?
He was, as a matter of fact.
Which one was he?
You look very...
Very smart.
How did I save your bacon?
The board of directors are convinced that the problem
at Prenslo arose at the Dutch end of the operation, not the British.
We were let down by the Dutch   a rotten apple at The Hague.
What do the Dutch say?
Oh, they're very angry. They blame us.
Their executive was forcibly retired, after all.
Of course.
Everything you said confirmed their suspicions
that the Dutch were to blame.
Well, I'm glad I could be of some use.
You look very beautiful tonight, Eva.
Has anyone ever told you that?
Yes. Now and then.
Taxi! Taxi!
At least they're out and about. We'll get one.
I'm in no hurry.
Whereabouts do you live? Hampstead?
Er, Bayswater.
I suppose we can always get the Tube. What do you think?
I told you, I'm in no hurry. A taxi will come.
Yeah, I'm sure.
A tin of pilchards!
And a bottle of whisky.
You do live very frugally.
Well, I'm not here very often.
Here you are.
We shouldn't have done that.
I'm not complaining1 It was lovely.
But I'm breaking all my rules!
Ah, yes, Romer's rules! It's not the end of the world.
Eva Delectorskaya   who would have thought?
You never told me why we were celebrating.
I didn't, did I? Promise to keep a secret.
Promise.
Well, we are all going on a little trip abroad.
Somewhere interesting?
Yes. Thanks to you, Eva Delectorskaya,
we're going to the United States of America.
Ah!
Do you think your Bobby von Arnim is right?
I did some more research. The dates fit.
Everything sort of vaguely fits.
So I've written to him care of the House of Lords.
Said I'm a journalist working for the Telegraph.
Asking for an interview.
About what?
I said secret intelligence service operations,
World War Two, that sort of thing.
Good.
That's very good. He'll be intrigued.
Who are these people trying to kill you, Mum?
Romer will know. He'll have all the answers.
When you go to meet him, I want you to dress differently.
What do you mean?
Be smart, efficient, attractive.
Thanks, Mum(!)
I'll give you a list of questions to ask him.
Nothing too close to the bone. Just to get his interest piqued.
Should I mention you?
No. Absolutely not.
Leave that to me.
Once the contact has been made, I'll follow up.
I found this. In a magazine.
It was taken about five years ago at his son's wedding.
There are no other published photos of him as far as I can tell.
This is what he looks like, now.
Do you want to see it?
Yes.
What if it's not him?
We'll keep looking.
Now you believe me.
I think I always believed you.
Well, maybe not at first...
But you won me over.
Were you ever scared?
At first it was more interesting than frightening.
It only got frightening later on. Once we went to America.
See you Monday.
What's your weekend?
One of my radio stations. Upstate. Very boring.
Best of luck.
Good morning.
Some of us have a job to do.
Come back to bed.
They think I'm in Canada.
I'm sure they're suspicious as hell.
No, I'm very careful.
Very.
What time's your meet?
All right. See you in Manhattan.
'Charles A Lindbergh, the famous aviator,
'speaking at an America First rally in Chicago today
'said that American democracy can only be preserved
'by keeping out of the present war in Europe.
'Any attempt to involve America in war abroad
'should be fiercely resisted.
'Mr Lindbergh declared that it was incumbent on the US Government
'and the president to build national defence at home
'and that those calling for intervention in Europe
'were only going to weaken our great country.
'Mr Lindbergh added that the pro war interventionist movement
'was in fact anti patriotic...'
Coffee.
Thanks.
Hello, you. Good trip?
Think so, the fish are biting.
Excellent news.
Morning, ladies. Race you to the coffee machine.
  Coffee is a poison.
  Did you hear about the raids?
No. I was kind of out of touch.
  800 bombs.
  All on London?
Yes, docks in the East End. Romer's right.
America's got to join this war or we'll have no London to go home to.
Has anyone seen him recently?
Romer? No. Not in a while. I hear he was in Canada.
Yes, yes, I heard that.
Ah, Canada!
Let's hope your story lands, Miss Dalton.
Fingers crossed, everyone.
'WNLR News flash.
'Nazi sailors at the French port of La Rochelle today welcomed
'the return of U Boat U 549 that torpedoed the US destroyer Kearny,
'south of Iceland last Wednesday.
'11 sailors died in the attack.
'On the conning tower of the Nazi boat were 11 American flags.
'Those are our boys, Herr Hitler. We won't forget.'
Excellent.
We can get that out coast to coast now it's broadcast.
Now it was on the news, after all, it's become news.
Sylvia, run that one everywhere,
particularly South America, Argentina, Mexico.
  Eve, get that to your Russian contacts.
  Will do.
Hello?
Yes, sure. It's Morris.
Morris?
Yes. Where?
All right, I'll be right there.
Something Russian's come up. How funny.
So, over to our Russian expert.
My God.
What happened?
Suicide...
So they say.
Who is he?
He's a Russian spy.
Defected from the NKVD a year ago.
He's a mine of information about Russian penetration,
here in the US and in England.
Was a mine of information.
Of course.
Too late.
What's he got to do with you?
I was meant to meet him today.
He told the Americans everything they wanted to hear.
It was our turn.
I think I've met him before.
Really?
When I was being interviewed by "C" after the Prenslo incident.
In London. He was there.
How fascinating. In London?
"C" was in the room?
I believe so. What does that prove?
His name was Alexandr Nekitch.
He was going to give me some vital information.
That's why he committed suicide.
How did you get in this room? Isn't this the scene of a crime?
I've got some contacts in the New York Police Department.
I needed to see this for myself. The windows were closed.
The door was locked from the inside, key in the lock.
They're bloody good, these Russians.
What do you mean?
When it looks like a grade A, incontestable, unmistakable suicide,
(..it probably isn't.)
What's this got to do with me?
I need you to ask your Russian contacts   Tass, Pravda  
if there's been any new faces in town.
See what their word is on Nekitch's death.
Casual questions, you know, nothing to raise suspicions.
All right. Of course.
Must dash.
Ruth?
'Hello, Mum.'
What's happening?
'Lucas Romer replied.
'He's prepared to meet me. At his country club.'
'Mum? Are you still there?'
Good.
Come and see me and I'll give you all the information you need. Bye.
Everything all right?
I had a couple of ghosts on my tail on the way here.
Took some shaking. Very efficient. How about you?
Nothing. I took all precautions. Romer's rules.
I loved our weekend.
No one suspects anything?
Probably. They're all too clever. Little probing questions, you know.
Morris didn't, though.
When did you see Morris?
About an hour ago. He showed me the most horrible scene.
Some NKVD agent committed suicide in a hotel room.
NKVD? What's it got to do with Morris?
He was supposed to meet this man, Nekitch. But he died before.
Nekitch?
How odd. Why don't I know about this?
I assumed you did.
Anyway, next Wednesday I've got to go to a radio station in Chicago.
  I thought maybe we could...
  No.
Something else has come up. I want you to go to Washington.
Now.
Washington?
  Coffee?
  Please.
What do I do in Washington?
One white coffee, and a whiskey and branch water please.
Yes sir.
I want you to meet a man called Mason Harding.
I want you to interview this Mason Harding for Transoceanic.
Set it up. Make it an official appointment.
Then, you know, get to know him.
What do you mean? Make a date? Go for a drink?
Yes. Make it personal.
Why?
Mason Harding is number two to Harry Hopkins.
Harry Hopkins is the President's right hand.
Harry Hopkins knows Roosevelt's every thought.
Now, we need to know what is happening in the Oval Office.
We need to be THAT close.
Right now, we're THAT close.
So I get to know this Mason Harding. We have a few drinks. And then what?
How personal do you want this to get?
I'll tell you.
Maybe I'll pop down to Washington   it's an interesting place.
You can do it.
No man can stand in your way when you set your mind to it.
Look at me.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Here's the information. And money. Buy yourself a new wardrobe.
A change of look would be wise.
How will you feel if I get to know this man well?
How I feel has nothing to do with it.
How YOU feel has nothing to do with it either.
We're losing this war, Eva.
And we'll lose it for sure if we don't get the Americas on our side.
It's as simple as that.
And this Mason Harding is the weak link? The way in?
Yes.
We think so.
It's very important, Eva.
Of course.
Why would Morris think you'd be interested in a Russian agent's death?
He wanted me to sound out the Russian press agencies.
See what the word was.
Really? Most unusual.
Anyway. Call me when you've checked into the hotel.
I'll give you all the information you need.
This is Operation Eldorado. Mason Harding is "Gold". Good luck.
Just say that Morris Devereux was your uncle. No more.
Then watch for his reactions. Very closely.
Any little sign.
You've already told me that. Why are you so nervous?
You're making me jumpy.
I'm not nervous.
We've gone over everything. I know what to do.
Look, I'll miss my train.
Relax. I'm just going to have a chat with a man.
It's not that simple.
It's very important to me.
Lucas Romer, he's the only one that can help me.
The only one.
Look, I'll call you when I get back. It'll be fine.
All right!
I'm showing you to the ladies' waiting room, miss.
How can you tell if I'm a lady?
I beg your pardon?
Nothing, nothing.
If you wish to use the convenience,
could you ring the bell and wait. Somebody will be along.
Very reassuring.
Lord Romer will be with you shortly.
Excuse me, Miss Dalton. Mr Harding will see you now.
Lord Romer will see you in the library.
Miss Dalton. Do come in.
Lord Romer? How do you do. Ruth Gilmartin.
Eight out of ten Americans want nothing to do with your war.
Look, we're not kids.
My personal situation has nothing to do with this.
You have to watch for the tiniest thing. It may save your life.
Hello?
What is it?
I think I'm falling in love with you.
There wasn't a plan. I didn't have a plan.
If you'd just followed the instructions, none of this would've happened.
People only betray their country for three reasons  
Revenge, money and blackmail.
Things aren't adding up.
Where's the gun?
He trained me, he knew me incredibly well.
Someone wants all of us dead.
