Welcome to Match Of The Day two. It is sold cooked    all schools
tonight and like in days of yore, there's only one game at the top
flight of English football. We are at Craven Cottage, one of the most
romantic grounds in the Barclays Premier League and the home team
like to entertain the old fashioned way. Last weekend was a prime
throwing in a last minute penalty save for good measure. Simply, full
and score goals. Going into the weekend, only Manchester United had
scored more in the Premier League and while this man is leading the
way with five, he has a tremendous supporting cast. Nine Fulham
players on the scoresheet this season. The story in the away
dressing room could not be more different. The frustration
Angry reaction.    that is a millers. Sunderland problem is this,
fewer shots, few as shots on target, fewest amount of time in the
opposition penalty area and the least amount of goals in the top
flight, seven in total. Just one win in 18. If there's good news, at
least 80 ft Everton last weekend had a different goalscorer..
Johnson's goal was that club's first in over seven hours of
football, but only three players have netted for Sunderland this
season and one of those players was Demba Ba. Goodness me they've had
to work and work for that. Given their contrasting fortunes, we are
not sure whether today's match will be bad, a thriller or another
cringe were the Michael Jackson cringe were the Michael Jackson
cliche.    cringe worthy. Always off a wall, it is black or
white for these two. It is human nature for Martin Jol to tell his
players at the way you make me feel is proud. They want to be starting
something from the final    opening whistle. But Martin O'Neill might
say I want to be where you are. They last won a way in February. He
will tell his players, you are not alone, we can beat it. Chris Baird
is banned for Fulham and Kieran Richardson denied a crack at his
old club through injury. Karagounis and Kacaniklic cumin. Two changes
for Sunderland, Bardsley and Cattermole for Craig Gardner and
James McCdlean.    James McClean. It finished 0 0 here a couple of
Fulham. A good run by the full back. Berbatov could not get it on target.
Martin Jol has been quoted as saying if he can't turn the
fortunes of Sunderland around, he will step aside.    Martin O'Neill.
When Karagounis gets in a shooting clever pass by Berbatov. Rodallega,
supported by research.    John Arne Riise. Karagounis played a pass
short and Hangeland went in two footed. It is a red card. Both feet
off the ground in the challenge and Fulham have lost their captain,
Brede Hangeland. It was two footed as he stretched for the ball. It
was one footed, but both feet were off the ground as he made the
challenge. Fulham will say his foot goes down on the ball and he makes
contact with the ball. I think Fulham will feel that is very harsh.
As he comes in, he may have seen that from behind as a two footed
challenge. I can see why he has sent him off. I think he said, two
fitted to Hangeland. The first sending off made by Lee Probert
Set up well by Damien Duff. He got chance for Sunderland. They simply
can't score. Seth and yon, should he have gone for goal? It was not a
better chances, Fulham. Hughes was the saviour at one end and he
goals. Classic counter attack. It was just after Fulham had hit the
woodwork. A lovely ball, beautifully played, great weight on
the pass. First touch was a killer, the second touched slid it in.
Great quality on the first touch. Pressure and control and it took
the ball far enough away from Senderos, who could not recover.
Very, very well taken. Fletcher's cause for Sunderland and they lead
on the Banks of the Thames.    A Fletcher scores. 14 seconds before
Fletcher stuck it in, John Arne Riise hit the bar. How's your luck,
on Petric for the injured Bryan Ruiz. Can he get them back in the
have been some impact. Rodallega at pressurising Senderos as soon as
the ball goes to him. A terrific save! Lovely effort from Adam
Johnson. He really had to stretch his frame, Mark Schwarzer, he is 6
touch as a substitute. Sunderland simply switched off. Extraordinary
lacklustre defending. Towards staff, he is onside, Sunderland waited for
a flag that didn't come and just turned their back on the play. Oh
dear. 1 1. Petric accepted the chance. Play to the whistle, boys!
Not only did they stop, but they turned away from it. Fees are
experienced players.    Aviva. Pulham    Fulham have had another
problem. Petric has hobbled off. Goodness me. They've got no more
Fulham are unhappy in the dug out area. They are claiming that Petric
was studied in the build up or just after the goal. A great leap by
Carlos Cuellar and Sunderland are back in front. What an
extraordinary second half after such a boring first half. Quaye are
allowed to leap virtually unmarked.    Carlos Cuellar. He restores
Sunderland's lead. His first goal for the club, his first goal since
February 2010. Expertly steered in. In off the inside of the post.
Fulham have to do it all again. Petric is back on the field of play.
After he scores, was he had? There was certainly a challenge on him.
It has cut his leg. But Carlos There was contact. There was, and
that is the invitation to go over. The wall is nowhere near back 10
yards. Petric with the free kick, it flew off the wall. Sunderland
He has been scratching for form all season. That is a belter. His first
goal since March and Sunderland should have the points now.
Fletcher rolled it in. Bang! That is a super strike. Curling away
Sunderland think they had the game wrapped up. Fletcher in the middle
well. Well played, Mignolet. Sidwell never cleared his feet to
have a clean strike. The goalkeeper narrowed the angle and made himself
goalkeeping. Fulham have had their It was a strong performance. At
times we allowed Fulham back into the game. They've been a fine side
for quite some time so I suppose that was almost inevitable. It was
a big one for us. We know we've got the ability and a great squad.
Probably lacking a bit of confidence with the result not
going away. We have got some momentum now. We played well last
week but did not get a result like we did this week. Key I thought we
did locate with 10 men in the first half. With our quality in midfield,
maybe there was still a result in there for us. But then they scored
to make it 1 0. We had to make some awkward substitutions, but it paid
off and we scored. Then we had to play with nine men and they scored
the second one from a corner kick. I think the red card was probably
their luck, but that happens in football. I think he went for the
ball. It was not over the ball, it was under the ball. Then he slipped.
I think the referee has probably, although by the letter of the law
you give it, he was probably the only one at Craven Cottage who
Credit where credit is due in a second, but let's get straight to
the big decision and the sending A unfortunately, he has got to go.
He is unfortunate because we get the beauty of the replay, but that,
he is out of control, it is not a dirty, malicious two footed
challenge, but this one is unfortunate and clumsy. As we can
see, the referee just get caught behind another Fulham player. But
what he has seen his he has seen him leave the ground. When you
leave the ground, you were out of control. As a defender, is there
the argument that when he arrived at the ball, he made contact with
the ball and he was below with the ball? I think so, but I think
Martin Jol has Mail did, the letter of the law, he is in trouble. If
you go into that tackle in that way, you'd run the risk of possibly
A what Sunderland did his they started to see the difference in
the way that Fulham have to play because they have 10 men and they
used to it very well. And they used for an's gaps very well. Staunton
was very clever.    Johnson was This one here, you don't have to go
to ground, just make them play quickly, and then they started to
go forward. Johnson, getting into an area that we know he loves, down
the left hand side. That's right. As the goal comes in here, as a
defender you want to see Brian Rees engaging Adam Johnson.    Brian
Rees. Fletcher is begging for that ball to go into that space. But it
is a great ball nonetheless. First class touch, clinical. The way he
touches the ball, it makes the ball spinning back towards him, that is
what Fletcher does, he keeps the ball very close. Towards the end of
the game, Johnson getting into areas he likes, down the left hand
side, there is a massive gap because Gollum have to go for it,
they have 10 men.    if Fulham have to go for it. But again, finding
the areas that Fulham are leaving because they haven't got enough
players on the pitch. Sidwell just got caught under it a bit. Cuellar
has got a running jump against a standing jump, only going to be one
winner. The sending off was early, in a way does spoil the game.
Sunderland fans will not agree. Berbatov, tell me about playing
against him. At times he is unplayable. This season, he has
been sensational. The strength, along with the quality, he has been
a real bargain of for of Fulham. A bit surprised a few others didn't
take a punt on him. Good play, anticipation, good strength again,
and the touch is first class as always. What he does his team
receives the ball, and he let players coming to the game. He very
rarely passes balls defeat if he doesn't have to, he will put it
into an area where he wants you to go, where it will be more dangerous.
So he thinks for himself and he thinks the first step for the next
player. He is two, three passes ahead. He was getting a bit
frustrated, finding himself in areas, may be deeper than they
would have liked. He has found himself in the midfield area, way
you want him is in the final third, When you have got 10 men, you are
losing and not getting as much ball in the right area, you have to play
the way you can with 10 men. He ran two kilometres of for Bulgaria once,
he has an unfair reputation. When you have got Berbatov happy, he is
very dangerous. He is happy at the moment. A how much of today is
about the performance, was it about certain individuals getting the
break? Are they all didn't play well, as a team they played well,
they played hard together, Sessegnon didn't actually play that
well, but his finish was He didn't start very well, actually,
he made some bad decisions. He is trying to play the right ball, but
execution was wrong. This one, a bit too laboured. We were saying,
where is the Sessegnon of last season? The this is the position
where you want him to be. That is how he scores. He is there, at the
edge of the box. Despite all of that, he has not had the best of
games, but he is still showing a desire to get forward, he wants a
goal to stop   . Just holds his run, get into a bit of space, and then a
special finish. Martin Jol famously He is looking after a side which
cannot stop scoring and cannot stop conceding! His Ajax team it was
super. Now they are shipping too many goals. It wasn't a good day
for him. Sunderland have got renewed confidence, they can go
home and welcome West Brom! Looking forward to that? They have got a
few home games, they have had seven away from home, which is a big
factor, it is going to be a tough one next weekend. With that the
only Sunday game, we can go to town with yesterday's games. We'll will
Half first stop on Saturday it is Loftus Road, but QPR against
Southampton. The biggest game of We expect to be much better, a poor
Southampton, crest boredom. You get For Mark Hughes, it has all gone
wrong. Southampton are going to stay in that bottom three.
We will create chances, on another day, we will take them. We called

is a big game, but not big enough. So the world press are here, and we

is all or nothing. Six pointer. are going to do a six pointer.
is a massive game. Even more cliches than I thought! Winner
takes it all for me. As soon as a club and manager are in trouble,
the press descend. I hate that Gubba when people turn up because
ferries   , when people turn up because there is trouble. I have a
golden take a    ticket. You are one of the album males of the press
world, what is the story? It is a huge story. It depends which way
the story goes, but we are here because we think one of the
managers could end up in serious trouble if the result doesn't go
their way. Do you turn up in a game like this, hoping it will be a
newsworthy story rather than a good game of football? I hope these
managers stay on, I think Nigel Adkins has done incredibly. I think
Mark Hughes will turn it around given time. I am not here hoping
someone goes wrong, but clearly, they are the story. They are
playing a bit in the must win game, they are writing about a must win
toll in this basement battle at Southampton's advantage. QPR are in
Queen's Park Rangers! It is going to be a very tense second half at
confirmation of Southampton's first away point in the Premier League
labelled as a must win game. They I think we know what the story is
going to be, and that wasn't in the script but even the most
pessimistic QPR fan, but to be honest, they were woeful. Mark
Hughes must be incandescent, he needed his team to come out and
show some fighting quality today, and that first half was terrible.
Issues will obviously said the right things, are you reading
Between the Lines, reading his body language? He has been very
protective of his players so far, I think it will be difficult for him
to come in again and do that, but I think it will be interesting to see
the extent he criticises his players. I think today, he would be
justified. He might as well, today. Hats off to Mark Hughes, it takes
courage to come out and are to questions, they are a tough crowd
and he has some tough questions to answer.    answer questions. I feel
like I am intruding on private grief.
30 hours later, he is still the manager, Tony Fernandes loves to
let everyone know how he deals, he says, "fans come first, many of us
need a hard look at ourselves, QPR have amazing fans and they deserve
better". You think he is a great manager? Yes, this and be Vincent
Kompany last night, praising him, I am the same, I had a great spell at
Blackburn, unbelievable coaching staff around him, it is difficult
to put your finger on what has gone wrong. If Mark Hughes cannot do it,
I don't know who will sorted out. Sometimes at the bottom of the leak,
it is up to the players to step up. Is there added pressure on QPR, how
they would have had to approach that game against Southampton?
of money on one side, Southampton have not spent anywhere near the
money QPR have spent. I think that continuation of being together for
Southampton, getting to know each other's game, if you have got
players like Lambert in your side, that sum up Southampton, which is
hard working, they play some good For me, this sums are Southampton
up as the squad of players. They play some good stuff, but this is
what you need, you need players like Lambert at your are going to
put their head in where it hurts to help the club go forward. Not many
centre forwards are going to put their head in, knowing they will
get kicked. A lot of quality the QPR, but will any put their head in
when it hurts? Another player who stands out the in his Jason
Puncheon. He has been sensational. I think QPR could have got tighter
to him, every time he got the ball, he leapt forward, look to get his
shot away. Again, in an area, his first thought is, can I look
forward? Can I get my shot away? He A bad day for QPR. Great day for
something    Southampton. It is time to fill you win on the rest of
yesterday's games and even if you have seen them, they are worth
weekend, Saturday would have left you with a sore head. Almost
everyone would have gone for a win for Manchester United. Most would
have backed at Chelsea and we would have risked a draw at the Madejski
Whittaker. A marvellous save. Very goal! Anthony Pilkington for
Norwich. Look at that cross. And the header matches it and
Lindegaard hasn't got a hope. Great John Ruddy. I thought it was in. It
would have been an own goal by Paul Scholes! Does he deserve a pat
on the head! That's it! That is it! One of the greatest results in
brilliant finish from the Irishman. He lovely work from Zoltan Gera.
Morrison found space and look at that for a diving header from Shane
Hazard with his head. Just watch him. It might have come off Billy
Jones. Yes, it comes off the Odemwingie combined brilliantly in
the last game here against Southampton and they have done it
again. Long turned provider and Peter Odemwingie nods in. Steve
Clarke and Albion celebrate their 6th home winner of the campaign and
should have dealt with. Shocking have the equaliser! And Reading are
Coleman on Adam Le Fondre. Le Fondre against Tim Howard. He
scores! Reading League Two to one.    Reading lead 2 1. Maybe their
season starts here. Reading have won this 2 1. They are off the mark
at last. I feel obliged to start with West Brom. After a win like
that, did you get the day of? in today. And not like the old days,
more like the Monday off. This morning you were in full training?
You yes. Back training, a hard session, the lad's not involved on
the Saturday Play a tough session. Really hard today. I'm thinking
that the people who are least shocked about beating the European
champions at the Hawthorns of the West Brom squad, management and
staff because the signs were there. Your home form has been sensational.
Amazing. We have great team spirit, today at the training session
everyone had a smile on their face. Everyone is desperate to get in the
starting 11. As he was sitting on one bench, the other bench must
have been a real tonic before the game. Two first offenders,
midfielders... You always look at the team sheet. The best two
defenders were out. You can't take anything away from the performance
of West Brom, they deserved it. not saying Reading are not in a
fight, but if you look after table for the last six games, they are
competing. They are 11th on form over the last six games. They've
had only one defeat in seven, it is had only one defeat in seven, it is
too many draws. Get competitive. Get consistent. They are not
getting the credit they deserve. They are working hard. Their
performance was superb. Le Fondre coming back, he started in the
lower leagues. Stockport, Rochdale, they bought him for 350 from
Rotherham. He was a thorn in their side. He worked hard, or was on the
shoulders of the defenders. The keeper is nowhere and that was very
keeper is nowhere and that was very unfortunate. Trying to get into a
position where he will cause a problem. Getting across the
defender, that is key. He has come back with confident. Confident
enough to take the penalty in one of his first games back. Jason
Roberts made a difference because he is strong, but we don't like to
say nice things about him, so we looked for some bad moments. This
is Jason being brave and strong. Big strong Jason Roberts! This is
what he does best, if there's any problems in defence, just Clairette.
Always best to clear your lines. Jason making sure there's no danger.
We love you! Norwich North sensational, a huge amount about
the more Match of the Day last night, but Turner got a bit of
stick at the start of the season. Three clean sheets in a row,
Bassong as well. They have steadied the ship. Now there's some
consistency at the back. The back two are getting to know each other.
Yesterday, sensational. They are working as a pair. They are
starting to become consistent as a back four, as a pairing. The two
centre halves work together. As a pairing, they are starting to work.
Grant Holt back in favour as well. Four more games starting in London
mammoth 29 goals in total. It's a hard life being a keeper at the
moment and Arsenal and Spurs were at it again, but they were not
alone as the goals flew in from the south to the north west to the
north east. Not surprising given the attacking talent on show in the
Defoe is onside. Adebayor! Wouldn't you know it? Within 10 minutes,
Spurs are ahead at the Emirates again and Emmanuel Adebayor scores
against his old side again. One ball over the top undid Arsenal.
Where was Mertesacker going? First challenge. Cazorla has gone flying.
He is sent off. He can't complain. His foot is nearly two feet off the
young player. Can Walcott finish terrific block. Forced home in the
end by David Silva. There was a side has given a penalty. Silva
plays it in... People will be wondering what the referee's
assistant has seen. Sergio Aguero has the chance to put Manchester
City 2 0 up, which she does very poorly indeed.    he does.    very
drolly. Appeals for handball and it is another penalty. It is given
again by the referee's assistant on the far side. What about this?
Sergio Aguero has taken one and scored one, but will not take the
Watson. Watson looks to be in real trouble. Two players with eyes on
the ball, but Sterling appeared to leap into the Wigan player. He is
not able to put any weight on his right foot. It could be a nasty
last six Premier League games, they are not going to get a clean sheet
today I that! Michu proves the point. What a moment this could be
for the former Newcastle supporter. Brilliant performances from Suarez,
Michu, but let shine a light on the young Englishman who played their
Raheem Sterling is starting to come to the fore, he is very positive,
he is quick, his vision is very good, he picks the right decision.
He is one who is standing up for me. So the Ntini years old.    17.
will be an interesting few months for Walcott, he wants to play
striker, his contract is up, he has had a really good season so far.
Joe Hart has been getting a bit of stick, but look at the kind of
Let's just leave him alone can he is a world class keeper. Theo
Walcott, he speaks great, doesn't he? He doesn't give anything away.
Great moustaches well! Are people working out Alan Pardew's Newcastle,
or is this about strengthening the squad because of their European
commitments? A bit of both, I think he may have exhausted his squad and
his options within the squad. There is an element of him being sussed
that, but he has a way to go. pleasure to be with you all day,
kind of, a more traditional Sunday, Sunderland double they run out of
red and white goalscorers in one West Brom's stunning start to the
season goes on, their win over Chelsea leaves them just one point
behind the Blues. Sunderland's crucial victory puts them three
points clear of the drop zone, but no good news if you're a QPR fan.
The last team to get off the mark with the head was Sunderland. This
is what the table would look like it only headed goals counted. This
is all we could come up with to put Steven Reid's team at the top!
Spurs are way ahead of Arsenal in this table at least. Surprising
better swiftly get away from this. With Fulham in action today, the
most mature squad in the top flight, we thought we would lead you with
