Senor Reece is coming!
I beg your pardon?
Senor Reece is here, in Chicago.
Mr Reece, did you say?
He'll be at the hotel soon.
I assume he wants his usual accommodations.
Si, si. Just like always.
We'll have everything ready.
Right.
Tucker, Hamlyn!
Mr Reece is in town.
He'll want the south wing.
We already have people in that wing.
Move them. Notify the kitchen. They'll need extra waiters.
Yes, sir.
We'll put Mr Reece in 200A as usual.
The Vidals are in that suite.
  You are acquainted with
  Miss
  Vidal.
  You
  move them somewhere else.
You don't move people like the Vidals!
Bring Mr Reece's trunks. Press everything, evening clothes first.
Mr...
You know I cannot see you here.
My father will be back any minute.
I have to speak to your father.
My father?
It's a hotel situation. About the rooms.
May I wait inside?
Yes, of course.
I thought it was moonlight. I was wrong.
About what?
About you. You're just as pretty in here.
Please...
Your aunt doesn't speak English.
She can understand the expression in your eyes.
Did you understand the poem I sent?
What poem?
Papa, this is Senor Harris.
Yes, I know Mr Harris.
There's been a mistake about these rooms. They were already reserved.
I have another suite, larger, with a breeze from the lake...
We are comfortable here, young man.
Yes, sir. It's the manager's orders. Isn't there anything I could do...?
Oh, yes, there is.
You can tell me if you wrote this... "poetry"... to my daughter.
I'm in love with your daughter, I would like to marry her.
I could never approve of this marriage.
Our way of life is too different from yours.
I have no intention of being a hotel clerk all my life.
I came to Chicago to get into the cattle business. A man can make a fortune these days.
Money is no particular recommendation.
Maria, we are going home. Start packing
Be good enough to have my bill sent up.
Goodbye, young man.
And don't think that love can find a way. I know all the ways.
Here he comes.
Hi.
Mr Reece, it's a pleasure to have you with us again.
Pleasure to be here, Fowler. Take care of my men.
The boys will take you to your rooms Bring a large herd?
Worst trailing I ever saw.
Send up some whisky and a few dozen cold chickens. I'm sick of beef.
Yes, sir.
There'll be the usual party tonight.
All taken care of, Mr Reece.
Hot baths! We've been on the trail for two months.
< First one into the bath, boys.
Senor Vidal!
Senor Reece!
What are you doing in Chicago?
Visiting. I'm going back to Mexico.
Got any cattle worth buying?
< I can sell you all you want.
Hold on to them till I get there. Hasta muy pronto, amigo!
Me darara mucho gusto en recibirlo.
Maria.
< Maria!
We lost 87 head on the stock train between here and Wichita.
They got shaken off their feet, kicked to death.
You should have seen that road, it had rail gaps in it eight inches wide
If we'd trailed them then it would have been better, lose a few pounds, save a few cows.
What's the opera season like?
I beg your pardon?
Opera, OPERA!
I dunno, I guess it's all right.
You call yourself civilised and you don't know about the opera season?
I keep my mind on my business.
Fine. I have 2,476 head. What are the quotations?
2½, 2¾ cents a pound, average run of the herd.
Could go down by morning.
Could go up too.
I've 80% grass roots, 10% half fats, 10% canners. Sounds about right?
Low on canners.
High! I'm giving you the best.
I figure 2¾ for the whole lot.
We figured more like 2½, Tom.
2¾ or I feed them till they go to 3. Well? I'm heading for a hot bath.
The New York market's closed until tomorrow.
We'd better think it over.
You do that.
Paco, go and keep your eye on those cows   we're holding onto them.
This city has all the coal in the world and you can't get hot water!
Where's that boy? In the hall?
Boy! >
When I take a bath I want hot water and I mean hot water!
(MUTTERS) Hot water!
Tom, you ready to talk business now?
The boot's grown to my foot.
I think I'm beefsteak.
You were quiet out there.
Let the boys dicker. Makes it easier for a man to close the deal.
Give you 2½ cents for everything   if you want a deal.
You know me and cows. I'd as soon own them and be poor, than sell them and be rich.
You haven't time to wait for them to fatten. You need to start a new drive.
You need beef so bad your mouth's watering.
You can have the lot for 48,000.
You got a deal.
Now we can quit lying and do business!
Pull up a chair and open this whisky. Have a drink, Mike. Boy, more whisky.
Yes, sir! >
Tom, when will you get smart and stop beating yourself on that trail?
We could build up the biggest meat packing business in town.
I could never play partners, Mike. Thinking about it makes me itchy all over.
Get some decent clothes on. We're going to the opera.
What about the party?
That's after the opera.
Pour it in, son.
Sounds like it's already started.
< Come in.
Mr Reece, I took the liberty of bringing these to you.
Crack one of them for me.
You're going back down the trail to Mexico?
If the Good Lord spares me.
If I ever get another drink.
Mr Reece...
To the brim, boy.
Yes, sir. Er, Mr Reece,...
..I'm a farmer.
Well, you had me fooled.
No, what I mean is, I was raised on a farm and I know about animals.
I'm keen on the cattle business, that's why I came to Chicago.
I'd like to work for you, sir.
Cockroach.
Why go trail herding?
Well, all my life I've dreamt of going into the cattle business.
I hate Chicago, I'd like to live in the open. You know what I mean.
Lying under the stars listening to the boys singing round the camp fire?
And your faithful old horse grazing by your side.
You do much riding?
Me? Well, I bet I could ride all day and all night.
Is that a fact? I bet you like horses.
I sure do.
I thought so. Well, you're an idiot.
A dreamy idiot, the worst kind. You know what the trail is really like?
Dust storms, cloudbursts, a man's a fool to want that life.
That hogwash about horses   their loyalty, intelligence  
..you know a horse has a brain the size of a walnut?
They're mean and stupid.
< Not enough sense to move away from a hot fire.
No sensible man loves a horse. He tolerates it because riding's easier.
Pour me more whisky.
There's no horse ever...
  Did you ever
  taste
  horse?
No.
< Hasn't got a flavour, just tastes like horse.
As for cattle, those miserable slab sided fleabags   pour yourself a drink.
No matter what you say to me, I want that job.
Try another outfit.
I have tried.
A tenderfoot's a responsibility.
It's not your responsibility. >
Everything is my responsbility.
Could you put the studs in my dress shirt? Can't be late for the opera.
Yes, sir.
I thought I saw a spider up there.
Mike, isn't that the most beautiful thing you ever heard?
Opera sounds bad no matter who sings it.
Boss, this is the best party you ever threw!
Better than last year?
  She
  wasn't here then.
Thank you for that extra money. We weren't expecting it.
Thank my friend here, he overpaid.
Well, well, well, leaving a little early?
We got the poker game set up.
Let's go to work. You ladies mind?
Mike, come on.
Hate to bleed you, Tom. I'll raise that 100.
Up to you, Reece.
I'll call you.
Three kings.
Beats me.
(GIGGLES) Oh! Oh!
50 on the filly.
You got a bet.
(SCREAMS) Take your hands off me. >
This is not my night, I guess.
< Your deal.
Want to buy some chips, Tom?
Not right now.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'd like to pay my bill.
I'm leaving tomorrow and I want to pay while I still can.
Divide what's over amongst the help.
We figured you'd stay a week.
So did I. I don't usually lose quite so fast. See you next time.
If you don't have any money, how will you buy cattle?
My credit's still good.
Mr Reece, could you use some money?
What if I could?
You might take me with you as a partner if I invested some money.
How much you got?
I beg your pardon?
£3,800. My father gave it to me when he sold the farm.
Where is it?
Right here in the safe.
Well, get it out, boy.
Yes, sir!
There they are, gents, all spades.
Where d'you get money at this hour?
An honest man has friends wherever he goes   you wouldn't know about that.
Mr Reece? Mr Harris would like to see you.
Harris?
The desk clerk.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
You want to see me?
I wrote out a contract about our partnership.
Contract? What for?
So we both know what the deal was.
I've never signed a contract or welched on a deal in my life.
Do you think I'd sell my reputation for 3,800?
No, I didn't think that. It's just...
You go home and get some sleep cos we're pulling out first thing in the morning.
I hope you don't think I didn't trust you.
Forget it!
By the way, my name's Tom.
Thanks. Mine's Frank.
Thanks.
< Stampede, come on, let's go. The train leaves in ten minutes.
Mendoza, wake up.
What?
We're heading south.
So soon? What happened? You lose all the money so quick?
I won it back   most of it at least. We're getting out while I'm ahead.
I hear you got a partner.
Who told you that?
< Hi, Tom!
He did. >
He's all excited about the trail.
He's got a girl in Guadalupe.
How are you feeling, Tom?
Got a headache... Now, look, boy.
My name's Frank.
I borrowed money from you last night. I'm paying you back now.
I don't want it. We're partners.
I was drinking last night. I made a mistake.
I don't want a partner. Take this money and go back to the hotel.
I quit my job at the hotel.
Why d'you do a fool thing like that?
Because you got a girl in Mexico?
You made a deal with me and I paid for a share of your outfit.
I've ridden this country for 20 years. I've sweated every track between here and the Rio Grande.
You figure you bought that?
I bought what you sold.
And the arrow holes in my hide?
I believed you when you said you never welched on a deal.
I'm trying to give your money back.
That's not our deal.
< He's right.
How do you know?
If not, you would have killed him.
You called me Tom. I'd prefer you'd call me Reece.
Any time you want your money back, you ask for it.
What about this fellow Reece?
He's all right if you're all right.
When's he pay off? End of the run?
You ask for what's coming in the middle of a river, he'll pay you off   in dry bills.
< What you say, fellas? You looked a little scary last time.
We've been in Chicago   barrel fever
Reece only gave us one night   but what a night!
Get my telegram?
We pick up the horses outside town. I brought yours.
Did you hire the extra hand?
Say hello to Doc Bender. He used to be marshal of Wichita.
Hi.
You got a reputation, Bender. I want a cowhand not a gunslinger.
I'm a cowhand now. I like cows better than I like people.
All right. Let's get going.
Paco, get him something to wear. He can't go on the trail like this.
I'll buy some clothes, if you don't mind waiting.
Nobody's waiting for you. You gotta keep moving.
See if there's a spare rig in the chuck wagon.
Come on, Harris.
Beats me how women go for cowboys.
Women like the smell of a horse on a man. Makes them giggle.
Smell of a horse never did me no good. Just makes them move away.
Maybe you been associating with the wrong horses. Good looking boots.
Move 'em out.
How's the water supply been?
Not bad, boss.
Pick your horses. Start riding them, get the fat off them.
< Those that haven't been broke, start breaking them.
These go on any special way?
Yeah, like an apron.
Shake your tail, there won't be anything left fit to ride.
Ha!
Bring that horse back.
If you can't ride him, carry him.
Here comes Harris!
Here he comes again.
(YELLS) What is that?
Salt water and whisky. Best way to toughen it up. Any better?
Yeah. Burns instead of just aching.
Supposed to. Fries your hide.
You look half dead.
Don't you ever get a day off?
You got to learn to sleep in your saddle.
That's it!
Oh!
Harris. >
I told you to ride night herd.
Capper's doing it for me.
Do your own job.
If you can't pull your weight, have your money back.
I told you I didn't want the money back.
Then go to work.
This filly in Chicago, she says to me,
"You stay here with me, I'll take care of you."
Why didn't you take her up on it?
Who wants to live in Chicago?
Turn this boy loose around a woman, he's got enough lies for a year.
Joe, tell the boys about the time you ate them Indians.
I ain't ate but one Indian in my life. Then it was just a haunch.
Being a town marshal, I figured that was a good job.
What made you give it up?
Same old story.
Man gets a reputation with a gun, you just got to do too much killing.
In Wichita, two of them jumped me in the dark, I had to shoot them both.
They was just a couple of drunken saddlebums wanting excitement.
That's when I quit my job as marshal. That's no way to live.
Can't understand it. Something smells good.
You'd think you was being poisoned.
You got a visitor.
Them snakes. I found one in my boot yesterday.
Wait.
You ever see a more comfortable picture in your life?
Come to think of it, I don't believe I did.
Harris, want to see a prairie eel?
Cut it out.
Charlie, this is for you. It's a girl snake.
I like 'em with bigger hips.
I said to cut it out. >
He got me. He got me.
Go get him.
I got his legs. I got him here.
What are you trying to do? Pump that poison into your heart?
Leave me alone.
Must have got him in the vein.
Oh, my God.
Some day there'll be fences all up and down this trail.
I'd rather fight Indians than those miserable fences.
Joe would be rather fighting Indians Makes him hungry thinking about it.
Cut it out. I was near starving. I didn't even know that Injun.
I only kept one haunch.
Which haunch you keep, Joe?
The left one, of course. Right one is the working haunch, they're tough
How long from here to Guadalupe?
Eight, maybe nine, days.
I've been dreaming about those Mexican gals.
I wouldn't take 400 for what I dreamed last night.
You talk in your sleep. I wish you'd dream about something else.
You think of something better to dream about, I'll dream about it.
He's dead, boss.
Get some shovels.
Make it deep so the coyotes can't get him.
Keep away from there.
You killed him, aren't you satisfied? Why steal his boots?
  killed him?
I'll bust you wide open.
You're not busting anybody.
If somebody does something stupid, don't make it worse.
If you don't like what goes on, too bad. Nobody said you'd like it.
Get out there and start digging.
Anybody know the right words?
When something like this happens, people start asking "How come?"
Was it his fault or somebody else's fault?
That isn't for us to say. We don't know all the answers. >
All we know is the man's dead.
In the long run I don't think it would have made any difference.
If it hadn't been a snake, it would have been a steer or a Comanche...
..or his horse might have stumbled in a prairie dog hole.
He was a good man with cattle and always did the best he knew how.
Hope somebody says the same over me.
Fill it in.
Amigos! Alli esta mi Mexico!
After seven weeks it will be good to have chicken again.
< What are all the decorations for?
< Some kind of fiesta.
Donde esta el rancho del Senor Vidal?
Se comienza al salido del pueblo.
He says when we leave this town there ain't nothing else but.
We're going to Vidal's spread to pick up a herd.
I'm going too.
What for?
I'm your partner.
You mean you got personal business? I forgot about Miss Vidal.
You men, do your drinking now.
Any man who starts a fight will have to finish it with me.
Welcome, Senores.
Senor Vidal. Glad to be here.
This is Paco Mendoza.
Senor Mendoza.
Mucho gusto, Senor Vidal.
Frank Harris.
I know Senor Harris. He writes poetry.
He does?
I used to.
Come in, please.
May I present el Senor Reece.
El Senor Harris.
El Senor Mendoza.
My sister, Dona Luisa, my daughter Maria...
Senorita.
  ..and her
  husband
  Don Manuel Ariaga.
Would you care for a drink?
I'd like to get down to business. I thought we'd look over the beef.
Manuel, please bring our horses. >
  This
  way, Senor.
How much longer will this take?
We're staying till it's finished.
I hope you are satisfied, Senor.
Looks like pretty good beef.
Best there is.
It is the fiesta of Santa Margarita. I hope you and your men will come.
If we get the branding done, it will be a pleasure.
The boys could stand some amusement.
You did not get my letter.
I left Chicago the day after you.
I wrote to you to explain. I never expected to see you again.
Why didn't you wait?
You must leave now. I am not permitted to see you alone.
Answer me. Why didn't you wait?
I should explain, Manuel, that Senor Harris is a friend from Chicago.
And I should explain to you, Maria, that you are my wife.
  You will, of course, not wish to see her again
  alone.
Senor Reece is waiting for you.
The final event is the game of the cattle.
Mendoza, what's this about?
Crazy game. Stay out of it. That's an outlaw bull.
He's a real killer. Horns are painted red. >
Man has to put a ring over his horn. Sometimes he does it. Sometimes he gets killed.
Not for me.
Don Manuel Ariaga challenges anyone who wishes to compete.
Perhaps one of the Americanos would like to take a chance.
I wouldn't go in there for a bottle of whisky and a redhead.
Now for the American caballero. >
I'll bet ten on the American. >
100 silver dollars.
Anybody else wants an advance?
Harris, come here.
I'm playing this one myself.
Why didn't you say before?
I didn't have any money up before.
Are you trying to show off?
Getting killed trying to make money is one thing. Getting killed to impress a female is stupid.
Paco. No, take him away, I don't want him.
You crazy, Tom?
I don't want him cut up.
Next contestant is Don Tomas Reece.
Open it up.
Senor.
I could not let you go without seeing you   without talking with you alone.
My father was troubled about us in Chicago.
As soon as we returned, Manuel and I were betrothed.
In this country, children have no say.
You love him?
I am not a child any more, Frank. I cannot have everything.
I want you to tell me, do you love him?
What's the matter with you?
I need a drink.
Stay away. Charlie's inside asking for trouble.
He's going to get himself carved up.
Doesn't he need any help?
You want to help him? Then you help him.
Get one of their knives in the belly and you won't hold your guts in.
I'm not gonna run out on him.
You're a good boy (!)
Joe, wake up. Charlie's in trouble. He's gonna get his throat cut.
That's his problem.
You gotta help me.
Charlie's trying to grab somebody's woman.
No reason for us to get hurt.
If a man picks a fight, he's gotta fight it. The fun's in the picking, not the fight.
Doc, help me, Charlie's in trouble. He's in a saloon and four guys are gonna jump him.
Four of them?
What do you say?
I don't like the odds.
We gonna let him get killed? >
All right, Harris.
Suppose you shut up and go to bed.
  What are
  you
  gonna do?
I'm going to bed, same as you.
What happens to him?
He's old enough to get himself out of trouble.
I got a herd of cows to worry about.
A man's life means nothing to you? All you care about is your cattle.
You're the most miserable bunch of men I ever saw.
Not one shred of decency in you.
  I thought I'd be living with some
  men.
Not just a pack of animals.
I'm sorry we don't measure up to your way of thinking.
Nobody cares what you thought the trail was going to be like.
You wanted to play cowboy but the game's rough.
I'm going back to help Charlie. Who's coming with me?
Nobody's leaving. Go and start trouble, we'll lose more men.
Forget about what's really bothering you. Starting a fight won't help you get that girl back.
That doesn't work either. I'm going back and there's nothing you can do.
< Harris.
Aaargh!
The fire!
I see it.
You had enough?
No.
Enough!
You don't even fight like a man.
Fighting's no game with me.
I'll remember that. Next time I'll use a crowbar.
You just do that, son.
Peggy, I want some hot coffee.
Move 'em out!
How's the arm, Charlie?
All right, boss. It's my drinking arm.
He got cut up a little. Not enough to teach him a lesson.
Harris gonna make a good cowboy, eh?
You think I've been rough on him?
My father used to say that to my mother.
He always treated me too hard   but he liked me very much.
Capper!
Just leave it there for the coyotes. He can't keep up with the herd.
Get a cow to feed him.
I don't want that on my saddle.
  This calf is worth 20. What are
  you
  worth?
Take him back to the herd, Capper.
C'mon, cow cow.
You're learning.
That a cow's more important than a man? I don't like your rules.
Harris,... I've been meaning to talk to you about something.
What?
That girl back there.
Those things can be pretty rough but a deal like that never does work out in the long run.
You got too much going against it.
So just mark it off as a part of growing up.
I think you're better off.
You do, huh?
Maybe it's none of my business.
That's right. It's none of your business.
Curtis, look! Indians!
They've been following us for three hours. They want strays.
I'll bed the herd down. We'll make camp up there.
Esta bien, compadre.
Paco.
How many men you got with the herd?
Two, just like always.
You better put a couple more on.
Where's Harris?
He went out after some strays   30 or 40.
What you send him out for?
He went by himself.
I want two more men down there.
Harris back yet?
Not yet.
Reece, Indians.
Comanches.
Wait till they get in range.
Must makes you feel kinda hungry.
Shut up, will ya?
They're not heading this way. They're after something else.
Harris must be down in that arroyo.
They're gonna hit him and run off with those strays.
That how come they passed us?
They got a better deal.
Kill one man and get 40 head.
We wouldn't stand a chance.
Fine time to play cowboy.
While they're busy with Harris we could get away with the herd.
He's a goner anyway.
< Paco.
We'll stampede the herd into that arroyo and drive those Indians off.
You'll never get the cattle back.
I too like this boy, but we have to think about the herd.
It's my herd, isn't it?
It's all right.
You can't ride with that.
What's the matter with you? Why are you scattering our herd?
You're still wearing your hair.
I could have fought them one by one.
I wish I'd let you try.
Reece's going to be riding that wagon for a while. I'm taking over the herd.
Mendoza's taking over.
I'm the partner, not Mendoza. Doc, take him to the wagon.
We gotta work till we get that herd rounded up.
Si, Senor.
I oughtta tear him apart.
He's young. Full of frijoles.
What can go wrong? I'll keep an eye on things.
We'll cut him some splints.
Let's keep moving. We can't rest now
Come on, it's nearly dawn, mount up
Get off my bedroll, Curtis.
I'm exhausted. I ain't moving.
I'll teach you some manners.
You'll learn some than you teach!
Cut it out.
We're gonna see what you had for breakfast.
Get back up the hill.
Slack off, Harris, the boys are getting pretty mean.
We rounded up most of the herd.
How many head did we lose?
Just over 200.
That's a lot of cows.
It's too bad for you.
Why?
We found my cows. Yours got lost.
That's very interesting. How did you separate yours from mine?
Easy. I used a crowbar.
Boys, move 'em out!
How far is it into town?
Just over the hill.
Like to draw my time when we get in. Think I'll stay a while.
I thought you weren't going back?
If I wasn't a marshal, I could live here peaceful.
There was a fella, Sam Hacker, no good cuss, but we were friends.
Miss the old son of a gun.
You're getting old, Doc.
A man has to have something besides a gun and a saddle. You can't make it by yourself.
I wish you luck, Doc. I hope it turns out peaceful.
I'll see you next time.
Twelve cars loaded.
Twelve cars. All right, keep 'em moving.
Did you hear about Doc Bender? He's dead. He killed himself.
You're crazy.
He was in a saloon with a friend of his, Sam Hacker.
This Hacker fella pulled a gun. Doc had to kill the guy.
What happened to Doc?
He hung himself. At the livery stable. Nobody can figure out why.
< Thirteen cars loaded.
Right, thirteen.
Doc won his fight fair and square. Why kill himself?
Nothing we can do about it.
Mendoza!
Yeah. >
We got cattle to load. We need the next string of cars now.
You just don't give a damn, do you?
You're a fine one to talk.
I saw you bury a man once. It makes no difference, you said.
Maybe I changed my mind. Maybe watching you made me change it.
If you had anything worth saving I'd beat you till you couldn't stand up.
You haven't gotten tough   just miserable.
Boss, we're gonna lose some cattle. we got three down steers in one car.
Harris, give Capper a hand.
There's four down now.
I see 'em.
You crazy? They'll rip you open. I wouldn't go down there.
Not your cows.
You made this fella tough. Now you don't like what you made.
He would have been all right if it wasn't for that girl.
Come on, play.
He learn how to handle cows. Maybe he will learn how to handle women.
That crazy Harris is with the cattle trying to pry them off the floor.
What d'you leave him there for?
I ain't the ramrod. He is.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of burying people.
I suppose this one's one of mine.
All depends if we can save it.
Let's go.
Slab sided fleabags!
About those cattle we lost.
Maybe I made a mistake.
Yeah?
I don't think they were all yours. I'd say about 50/50.
That sounds like a fair split.
Let's go.
Mr Reece, good to see you.
Good to be here. My partner, Frank Harris.
Hello, Fowler.
He used to be in the hotel business himself.
I have your rooms all ready. How long do you plan to stay?
