Welcome To DIY SOS, the programme which shows you
what it's really like when builders are left alone in the house.
You might even pick up a tip from our designer, Julia.
Fred the Spread, the man with the longest arms.
Chippy Mark.
Billy, who's not the brightest spark.
Julian, the walrus of love.
And our lovely apprentice, Mat.
Open your eyes.
And the one question you have to ask yourselves.
Could we look any more ridiculous?
This week, we're in Frimley in Surrey.
Ooh, ooh, no, I feel a bit dizzy now.
Home to Lisa, Andy and nine year old son Jordan.
This is their home, where for five years the three of them have been sharing a bed.
The reason?
The upstairs is a total mess.
Well, we've been in the house about nine years now.
Then we've just been struggling, up to now, just to get the insides
up to somewhere liveable really.
But work stopped on the extension when Lisa started getting pounding headaches.
I got a scan straightaway
and it was then they told me, "You've got a tumour."
Lisa had been diagnosed with a brain tumour and had to undergo a serious operation.
I haemorrhaged...three times?
  Yeah.
  Was it three times?
  Yeah. By...
She started the operation on Monday, about 8 o'clock,
then, by 12 o'clock, he said, "We don't even know whether we can save her life."
Although the tumour was successfully removed, there was no way of knowing how it would affect Lisa.
They discovered she couldn't talk and couldn't feed herself and stuff like that.
I couldn't do nothing.
So I think I've come quite a long way.
Oh, absolutely.
And, throughout all of this, Lisa was pregnant.
Lisa was 12 weeks pregnant when she went in. Then...
I think the baby was terminated...
Don't, you'll make me cry.
About 22 weeks, something like that.
That was quite traumatic, because you knew the baby was formed then.
But it would have been too badly brain damaged.
If it had have gone on, I wouldn't have been able to look after it, so...
Everything's done for a reason, I think.
Why are we in this position with this particular room? What's been going on?
We done the downstairs two years ago.
This has been in an ongoing state since then.
After Lisa's illness, I had to take two years off
and the savings went and along with it was the ability to get this done.
Would it make much of a difference to get this sorted out, to general life for the family?
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah, it would be great to have our own space.
And for Jordan to have his.
  He don't want to sleep with Mum and Dad, does he?
  No.
He'll be saying, "Oi, Mum, move over, I want to get my girlfriend in."
Cos he would!
Yeah, you're right. It's about time he had his own space.
'So we'd better get Jordan back in his own bed, and say no more.'
This week, Julia's gone all country house hotel on us.
Mark is gonna create a bookshelf... radiator...cover thing
that'll run the length of the room.
We're moving an entire wall to make way for a walk in wardrobe.
And there'll be a special back lit headboard.
But we couldn't stop there.
Unknown to the family, we're doing the en suite bathroom
with a special seated shower cubicle.
As if that wasn't enough,
we're giving Jordan a football themed bedroom.
So we're plastering three rooms.
  Yeah.
  Putting a bathroom in, moving a wall...
  Yeah.
And we've got to take the ceilings down,
because we've got to put wall lights in and a shower light and a centre light.
'Loads to do, let's get cracking.'
  Oh, whoops.
  'Jules, not literally.'
  Just broke.
'We've got plumbers in to help us out with the waterworks.
'Even though Billy seems to think he could do it.'
  Who's in charge of the plumbing side, then?
  Definitely not him.
  Not him.
  It's like electrics.
You have to and...flow.
Flow and back. Just like electrics.
Live and neutral. It's the same.
Flow in and flow out.
Like we have electric in and electric out.
  They've got water and we've got electricity through ours. No difference, is it?
  You terrify me.
But never run your cables through a water pipe!
'Top tip, Bill. There's Mat. I bet you're wondering why he's taking all those screws off.'
  While you're wondering why I'm taking all these off...
  'I just said that.'
We're gonna move this third wall back to make a bit more space and depth in the wardrobe.
Thank you, Mat. And that's not all we're sharing with you this week.
Here's Jules with some inside info.
When you have a rough edge on a piece of plasterboard,
you can use a little surform.
Surform the edge off
to make it fit nice and snug and clean and tidy.
The common or garden surform.
That's the edge that I surformed. It's just fitting so snug.
It's unbelievable.
Perfectional, isn't it?
But, to be fair, I wouldn't expect a lot else from my good self.
'Is he on something this morning?
'The boys knock up a stud wall in next to no time. It all seems to be going rather well.'
That's nice.
'I spoke too soon.'
We've got a disaster at the moment.
I came down here to check out some of Jordan's trophies and things
and we normally don't let anybody into this part of the house.
Good job I came in here, because, as you can see, we've got a bit of a leak.
It's still running, guys!
That's a big leak. It's not just a pipe.
This is serious. Listen, we've got three inches in here.
Down back here.
This is gonna set us right back.
'We'll leave Julia with the drip. Perhaps he can help her mop up!
'Meanwhile, she's asked Mark to create a masterpiece of shelving
'that stylishly disguises the radiator.
'It runs the length of the room,
'so there'll be plenty of space for Lisa and Andy's books.'
These are the tops that are going on the bookcases.
Julia has asked me to put a moulding down the front of them, which I'm gonna do now,
which will be quite nice actually.
She wants a reeded moulding along here, the bottom of the shelf.
And then, on the top side, we're going to put a round over.
We've gonna have two different mouldings on it.
So it should look something like this.
'Yes, absolutely fascinating.
'I'd rather watch paint dry to be honest. This concludes the power tool section of the programme.
'Talking of things drying, how are we getting on with that leak?
'Not good, it seems.'
We've turned all the cold taps on.
They've run dry.
We've turned the main intake off.
So it should stop dripping.
But where the plumbers are doing their plumbing everything's bone dry,
so something's happened maybe underneath the floor.
There you are, I've turned it.
'In actual fact, it was the service valve that had been knocked on.
'No, I don't understand either, but turning it off solved the problem.'
OK, whatever you've done, that's stopped it!
'I think that's enough for one day. Let's leave yesterday
'and move on to today, where people have got more energy.
'Despite the leak, everything's dried and the plastering continues.
'Well, it would do if they got their minds off the music and on the job.
'That's better.
'That's not.'
We don't get fooled again...
'He's like a rock god, isn't he?
'As you no doubt realise, this show aims to bring you the best from the world of building wizardry,
'and this week is no different, is it, Mark?'
It's a wedi board, this is.
We can make all the stud work up with this to make the frame for the seat. Why is she having a seat?
Because Lisa needs to be able to sit in the shower.
This is perfect for anybody who fancies a seat in their shower.
This is fantastic stuff.
  It's completely waterproof, isn't it, when it's sealed up?
  Yeah.
'You might wonder what Billy's doing in the bathroom.
'He's got as far as he can with his electrics, so he's decided
'to teach Julia and Mark exactly what he knows about building.'
Me horizontal.
  No?
  No!
  Yeah, you got that right, mate.
What's that one?
  That's the horizontal.
  And what's that one?
  Your vertical.
Vertical's that.
Vertical is that.
I thought vertical was flat.
No, vertical is upright.
Vertical is vertical.
  I've just worked out how I can remember.
  How?
Vertigo, scared of heights.
So vertical runs down.
Now I've got to work out horizontal.
  Something for horizontal.
  When you're dead,
you're generally horizontal.
Me and Elaine have made our own headstones, already engraved them.
"Here lies my wife, cold as usual."
And she's made one for me. "Here lies my husband, stiff at last."
That's nice, Billy.
'Mark's pretty easy going but, as Billy's "help" continues,
'you can see him slowly lose the will to live.'
Got the perfect cut.
You've got to be very careful with these, because you can actually put them in...
'The thing is, he always wants to yip on.'
So this is nice.
  Lovely, yeah.
  There's no sort of hidden...MDF and...
  'He's going...'
  He's a nuisance.
  Don't forget, I need a hole in...
Yes, all right, Bill!
'He's gone.
'Time for me to escape and catch up with Lisa to find out how her illness has changed her life.
'Before Lisa's brain tumour left her having to relearn how to walk and talk,
'she had a successful career working for a pharmaceuticals company that saw her flying around the world.'
So a very high flying job.
  Very active, very career minded woman.
  Yeah.
Then you're struck down with this and you lose that.
You must have felt like giving up sometimes.
  Yeah, but you've got to keep optimistic.
  Because of?
Because of Jordan and Andy... and really myself.
Be optimistic. You're not gonna be like this forever.
I was invited to my friend's 40th birthday party
and it was fancy dress.
I thought, "I've got the wheelchair, I'll go as Little Britain.
"Lou and Andy."
Everyone just fell about laughing.
But I didn't want people to feel embarrassed.
So that way is a good way of
showing people not to be embarrassed to talk to me.
If we can get your bedroom sorted out, which leaves the other bedroom free, that will make a difference?
Massive difference.
Jordan can have the spare room while we do his room
and we can sleep together.
Not me and you,
but me and Andy can sleep together.
Yes, no, I didn't think me and you!
Sorry!
After all he's done and then you cop off with me. That wouldn't be right!
'I think this interview's gone horribly wrong. I think we'd better get back to the house, where...
'I leave the room for five minutes and it's all gone wrong.
'There's a designer in distress.'
Rectifying my mistake now.
Well, I'm not. Obviously, I've got somebody else to do it for me.
  For a change.
  Pardon?
  Nothing, I just cleared my throat. A bit of flux build up.
Ever so sorry. I didn't really think it through.
For a change.
Dusty in here, isn't it?
  That looks like hummus you're putting on the ceiling.
  It is, because we've run out of plaster.
This week, Julia's said bye bye to beige and minimalism
and hello to warm patterns and rich tones, so in this boudoir
she's combining stripes and florals with striking wallpaper.
That will look lovely. The black and the red will go nicely.
Like girlie underwear, isn't it?
Well, not nice girlie underwear, really.
All right, then. So the room's going to look like bad girlie underwear?
Is that a colour?
Bad girlie underwear. It should be. Yeah, yeah.
There's Mark in there knocking up a new pair of underwear for his missus.
  Ooh! There we are.
  That's a crutch.
  I was just thinking...
Flipping heck! He's making them to last, to be fair.
  Two pairs. He's quick.
  There's gonna be a lock on the front of that.
'Actually Mark wasn't constructing the world's sturdiest knickers,
'but the world's longest bookcase.
'But look out, Billy's about.'
The only thing I find a bit weird is that there's a socket in that wall, right behind the bookcase.
Honestly, don't even talk about it!
Why is it a mystery to you that when we're putting a bookcase against a wall
that Billy would put a socket behind it? Why is that a mystery?
Fair enough.
There's a socket there.
The socket was there before that was.
We never put any sockets in, remember.
I'm not suggesting that, all I'm saying is that, if you're gonna have a bookcase here,
then surely we'd move it onto that wall?
I've just thought, is this a bedroom?
Yeah! What...
My thought was, would you have so many books in a bedroom?
  Do you have a hundred books in your bedroom?
  Yes.
  Do you?
  Yeah.
  Do ya?
  Yes.
  I've got over a hundred books in my bedroom. And I've got about 400 downstairs.
  Oh, fair enough.
To be fair, though, Janet and Johns are...that's about 30 books' worth.
  Don't ridicule me, woman!
  I think she was having a go at me, to be honest.
Oh, were you? Oh. Pan back, then.
What are you doing with Janet and John books at your age?
  Oh, you're happy to join in now, are you?
'Marvellous! I think you'd better end that day and start the next day.
'There it goes, Wednesday, bottom of the screen, just so you know.'
Look at that! Look at that. It's got a proper ceiling on it.
It's starting to look like a proper room.
He's on the wall over there.
He won't be talking to me, because I was late in this morning.
I wasn't feeling very well.
But he doesn't take that into account.
You're either there or you're not as far as he's concerned
and he won't speak to me now for the rest of the day.
'Me and Jules, we were never apart.
'Always laughing, always having fun.
'We were inseparable.
'See, we used to have such a great time together.
'But they only ever show the good times. Blooming idiot.
'Always getting in the way.
'Look at him, thinking he's all that.
'I thought we were gonna be friends forever.
'Yeah, whatever, Nick.
'See that?
'That's what I think of Nick Knowles.'
Anyway, I'll pull myself together
cos Jordan's room has an American preppy football theme,
but Julia's kept the design nice and simple
so that Jordan can adapt it as he gets older.
The most important thing is the sporting theme.
After all, Jordan's mad about football.
So Billy and I have come along to chat to him and his dad at the local training ground.
Well stopped, well stopped.
The idea was that the bedroom next to us was gonna be completed
  when he was about five or six, so he could sleep on his own and we'd still be close to him.
  Right.
But, obviously, he's ten now.
So the endgame for you is to get to the point where that bedroom's done,
where you've got the en suite done, which makes it easier,
and then to get his bedroom done.
  Yeah.
  Then you can operate properly as a family.
  Yeah.
It's not really so much doing it for Lisa this.
  It also takes a bit of pressure off you.
  Yeah, it does.
When I come home at night, you feel like you've got to come in and work,
but by the time you've done a day's work, picked Jordan up,
then organised the football and stuff, there's just no time.
'With all Andy's time spent caring for Lisa, the work on the house
'stopped five years ago and it's stayed a building site ever since.
'So the three of them have been stuck in the small guest bedroom
'and, at nine years old, Jordan's never had his own room.'
When you was at hospital and you saw your mum for the first time, what was your reaction?
Quite unhappy.
Not very happy.
Just sad.
It's been a hard time for everyone really, isn't it?
Especially my dad, because he has to work on all the stuff by himself.
And your mum keeps nagging him, does she?
Yeah. Quite a lot.
You always seem smiling and happy, cos you've been through a lot.
What's gave you the strength to come through?
Well, my football basically.
Cos when I'm playing football, my mind's on nothing else but football.
And when I see you turning out for Chelsea,
I'll be a pensioner then, you'll give me a couple of tickets, yeah?
  Yeah.
  Give me five!
'While Billy gets his football boots off and his site boots on,
'Ben the tiler has turned up to deal with Julia's special tiles.
'Look at that.
'I love it when we bring in the professionals.'
Wallpapering is very petty pubic.
  Petty...
  I beg your pardon?
Wallpapering, it calms you.
  It's very petty...
  Therapeutic.
There's another word I can't say.
That's afilimarisation.
When you get to know something.
  Familiarisation.
  That's it.
I went for a job, cos I wanted to be a cameraman, cos I was a spark and at Ealing, BBC,
they could promote you to be a cameraman through training and everything.
And I wanted to, but I couldn't say afilimarisation, so I didn't bother
trying it, cos I wanted to filimarise myself with the camera.
That's the truth, that is.
What we gonna do with you?
  Don't change me, for God's sake!
  No!
'Good to see Jules has perked up.'
Hear that? It's the voice of an angel.
  He's had voice training, hasn't he?
  No, he's been kicked in the... HE WHISTLES
HE HONKS That's right.
I saw your face
In a crowded place...
'Voice of an angel? Hell's Angel more like!
'Mark's bookshelf's nearly finished.
'It needs attaching to the walls, but we don't want to see the screws.
'Surely there's a gizmo that can help.'
  I say, that's a very handy tool.
  Especially for tight corners such as this.
You'll never manage to tighten that screw down there.
Watch this space, Mr Knowles.
I'm going in.
Just like that, it's screwed together.
Gosh, it has as well.
Morning! Tea.
  Lovely day.
  Here we are. Cleaning up the floor,
skirting boards are going on and then this room is pretty much done.
Ready for the carpet fitters.
'For all you tonsorially challenged chaps out there, Jules thinks he has a solution.'
I've just fashioned a toupee for myself.
Really? Transparent toupee?
Do you think it'll catch on?
I think you'll be able to retire next year.
Does it move?
It's very versatile, isn't it?
Very good.
Very exciting. That's the boy's room about to be carpeted.
Once we've finished in there, we can move through and put some carpet into the main bedroom too.
That's gonna be a lot later.
'Lisa and Andy have no idea we've been doing Jordan's room and the en suite on top of their bedroom.
'And we've got yet another surprise up our sleeves. See if you can guess what it is.'
Oh, Lisa?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Lisa
Happy birthday to you.
'Yeah, it's her birthday, in case you didn't get it.'
Blow out your candles before we set fire to the place.
  There you go.
  Thank you.
'She gets to make a wish.
'Maybe, just maybe, we can make that wish come true.'
  Have you had a lovely day?
  Yeah.
'It's nice to wish her happy birthday,
'it's also nice for the boys to have a little bit of a relax and have a beer at the end of another long day.
'More work to do tomorrow.
  'Another new day.'
  Shiny.
'It's the last day. Although it's been a huge job,
'the walk in wardrobe is going in and we've got just the finishing touches to do.'
'Very pretty. Very nice.'
Skip!
'Yeah, thanks very much, Billy.
'Ah, see, that's where it should be.
'Very nice.'
To have a brand new bedroom would be lovely, cos it will mean
we can sleep on our own and have a bit of privacy
without the hoodlum in between us!
'Every night for the last five years, Lisa, Andy and Jordan
'have been squashed like sardines in this unfinished house.
'But, using a combination of Julia's brains and our brawn,
'over five days, together we've created this.
'Wow!
'So Julia has used the country hotel theme to create a space
'that Lisa and Andy can relax in.
'Mark's bespoke wall to wall shelves
'have plenty of storage for all their books,
'as well as covering the radiators.
'And how funky is that light behind the headboard?
'We've moved an entire wall to fit in this luxurious walk in wardrobe.
'But, as a special surprise for them, we did two extra rooms.
'We fitted an en suite bathroom with a seat in the shower,
'so Lisa can sit down.
'Look at the size of that basin.
'There! It's huge!
'And we snuck into Jordan's room.
'It's got a preppy American theme now
'and space for all his medals and trophies from football.
'For five years, the family have been sharing a room.
'Finally, Lisa and Andy are going to get a bed of their own.'
Open your eyes.
Oh, wow!
Lovely!
I'm going to cry again.
Lovely. Thank you.
It's lovely.
Yes, beautiful.
Round here, you've got your walk in cupboards. Have a look.
They're lovely.
Lovely, isn't it?
  Look at the carpet.
  I know, I wouldn't have even thought of that.
  You've got built in bookcases all the way down the far side.
  Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Lovely.
It's a bespoke piece of furniture, fitted only to your room.
Is it what you were expecting?
It's much better than that. Much, much better.
Can't wait to get in it.
  Without Jordan!
  Without Jordan, yeah!
If you come with me, there's another thing we want to show you.
  We decided not to stop with just the bedroom.
  Oh...
We decided what we'd do is we'd come and...
  make you an en suite bathroom.
  Oh, lovely.
  Tiles.
  I promised I wouldn't cry.
The tiles are beautiful.
They are.
  And a seat.
  And a seat.
Thank you. I can't believe this.
Well, we decided not to stop here.
So if you'd like to come with me...
  Wow!
  Go on, in you go.
  Wow!
Take a look.
He'll love it, won't he?
Being his first bedroom on his own.
  His first bedroom ever.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
Wow!
  How cool is this?
  It's great.
  This is your new bedroom.
  Cool!
  Do you want to go and sit on the bed next to your mum?
  Yeah.
  Marks out of ten for the room?
  Erm, ten.
All right, Lisa.
  Hello.
  Hello, darling.
  It's a pleasure. Jordy, you all right, son?
  Very well done.
  Well done.
  It's very good.
I can't wait to get into it.
Will it make a big difference to family life for you guys?
  Oh, yeah.
  Certainly.
I don't think I've stopped smiling.
There you go. That's what we do, and that's how we do it.
So, if you know someone who needs our help, the address comes up in a few seconds. See you next time.
