progress of business the House will rise for the fabric recess on
Thursday 17th and return on Monday 28. The provisional business for
the Backbench Business Committee. I should like to inform the House the
business in Westminster Hall for the third and 10th March will be,
Thursday a debate on the committee of Public Accounts report on
tackling inequalities in life expectancy in areas of the worst
health and deprivation, a debate on work and pensions committee report
on changes to housing benefit announced in 20th June 10 budget.
On the committee stage we are due to have at some time of Scotland
Bill, our clear understanding is the consent motion from Holyrood
will be finalised before we start consideration in committee. Can the
Leader confirm this is still the case? This week we learnt that more
than half the donations going to the Tory party have come from City
financiers. A party spokesman denied City donors were influencing
policy but can we have a debate on this? Scarcely was the magic ink
dry on project Merlin and that was some conjuring trick then the Lib
Dem Treasury spokesman in the other place, could contain himself no
longer. He called the deal pitiful, the Treasury negotiators
incompetent and arrogant and who could he have been thinking of? He
had this to say about the bones do, whether paid in cash or shares, a
multi million pound bonus is still a multi million pound bonus whether
you have to wait two years to buy the yacht. Clearly, all of this was
too much for the truth deniers on the Treasury bench and especially
his colleague the chief secretary to the Treasury who it seems set
him live on television. Does this not show when it comes to the
Conservatives and the gamblers, not my words but the words of the
business secretary last September, they are all in it together. The
truth deniers have take another battering this morning, 88 Lib Dems
council and group leaders have signed an extraordinary letter in
the Times, attacking their own Government. This is what they have
to say, rather than assist the country's recovery, the cats will
do the opposite, they accuse ministers of chastising and
denigrating local authorities through the media and the
communities Secretary from letting them down. Can we have an urgent
statement from the Secretary of State so he can finally admit that
cutting salaries will not do it and the price of his policies will be
paid by disappearing Sure Start centres, people losing their jobs
and volunteers are discovering there is no where left to volunteer
in! That is why the Big Society is now in big trouble and wipe
advisers at Number 10 are tried to blame each other for the mess. Can
we have a debate on the deep sense of betrayal many people in the
voluntary sector feel because having be marched to the top of the
Big Society help but at the other side there is not a pot of gold
that eight per so this. To CAP what has been a terrible week for
ministers, we hear the sad news the Deputy Prime Minister has had to
cancel his trip to Latin income    Latin America because the
Government has been defeated again on the jury Mandarin bill. I'm
surprised he has not taken the chance to flee the country after
the battering he received on the TV last night from angry students. Rio
De Janeiro will be working up to the news that they will not be
waking up to his company next week. The House was surprised to discover
this week that the Department for International Development gave
nearly £2 million of its precious development budget, not to
vaccinate children or to put them into a classroom, but to help to
pay for the cost of the Pope's visit to the UK. Can we have a
debate on this extraordinary use of our development spending and can
the Leader a short us when the reviews are complete they will be
reported to the House in an oral statement. His blog is very
interesting and there was intrigued to see him answering business
questions as, like being in a pub quiz. Since he invites me and sense
of almost everyone in the country now accepts the cuts are too fast
and too deep, there is a question that is puzzling many people and
perhaps the leader can provide the answer. Why should anyone vote Lib
Dem in? For the bonus question, why should anyone vote Tory either?
grateful to him. I notice in our exchanges over the last four months
he has never challenged the business I have laid before the
House and I hope there is a broad consensus the with the Government
is conducting the business and the way we are putting it reform has
commands support on both sides. On the consent motion it is our
intention to secure that before we reach the appropriate stage of the
Scotland Bill. We are more than happy to debate party funding and
draw attention to the fact 80% of the Labour Party's funding comes
from the trade unions were my party has a much broader base. Any motion
that we are over influence by any donations they get from the city
might have been destroyed by the statement on Wednesday when £800
million was extracted from the banks in the city. I hope that will
put an end to that particular myth. On the issue of the statement may
yesterday by my right honourable friend it was his party that gave a
substantial sum of money to the banks but do nothing in return.
Rose by contrast, as he will have seen from the state when we made
yesterday, we secured a substantial concession from the banks on lower
bonuses, more support, money for the Big Society bank. I think he
needs to contrast the D we got with a deal his party totally failed to
Secure. I have read the letter in the Times today from the lip
Democrat councillors, it says, local Government has made
efficiency savings of 3% in the past eight years, in stark contrast
to the runaway spending of Government under the previous
administration. We have also been planning for further savings since
the true state of the economy became apparent six months ago.
That is where they are coming from. Turning to the next issue that he
raised about local Government. We had a substantial debate yesterday
about local Government. The fact is we are offering an extra £400
million every day to plug the gap between spending and income and
that means tough decisions for all Government departments. The right
thing to do is sort out the deficit and end Whitehall domination of
local Government. On the question of local Government funding and
closures, let me remind him what the Member for Barking said when
she was culture minister. She published alive his consultation
paper and said I do not think Government to prevent authorities
from taken    taking local decisions to close libraries. We
hope that local authorities will respond to the challenges we face
them and they will have a comprehensive and efficient library
service which is what they are required to do by statute. On the
Deputy Prime Minister's movement, they built we are debating next
week, the Lords amendments to the bill is a bill which his department
is sponsoring and is entirely appropriate he should be here to
support it. The Catholic Church does a fantastic amount in age to
under developed countries and it seems rite we should recognise that
in the support we gave to the Pope's visit. Finally, on local
Government elections, we look forward to the local Government
elections. We are confident of not just retaining the seats we have
got, but winning even more seats from the opposition who are still
in total denial about the problems they left this country with.
large number of members are seeking to catch my eye, I am keen to
accommodate people as best I can but there is an important debate
taking place afterwards under the auspices of the Backbench Business
Committee which I must provide adequate time so the emphasis is on
short questions and answers. Would my right honourable friend see the
to make time for a debate on the Middle East given that the Foreign
Secretary will have returned over the weekend from an extremely
important visit to some of our important allies and the events
taking place in Egypt and possibly elsewhere are important to this
House. He is right that the Foreign Secretary is making a key visit to
the Middle East. The Government will want to keep the House
informed. We have had a debate on Middle Eastern matters in backbench
business time but it is the case and I say this to my honourable
friend the Government has reserved the right to have debates in
I thank the leader for allocating time on Monday 28 February. He is
always very generous on a Thursday in taking demands made by
backbenchers for debates in government time, and pointing them
in the direction of the backbench business committee. Can I ask him
to emphasise that all along government business is legitimate
backbench business, and that the backbench business committee
welcomes representations with open arms every Tuesday at 1pm? Mr
Speaker, given the of this and necessary conventions during
statements and questions, will he made with me to discuss how I
personally can make my public service announcements without
thinly veiling them as rather convoluted questions? The Leader of
the House. I'm grateful to the honourable lady
and we did indeed listen to the representations that she and others
have made that backbench business should not take place exclusively
on a Thursday. As she generously recognised we now have a debate on
a Monday. I am a keen supporter of the right recommendations, which
worked out the allocations between what government ought to do and
what her committee ought to do, and we are very anxious to abide by
that. I welcome public service announcements in the middle of
backbench business questions. In due course we will move to a renew
regime when we have a House committee weather will    wet there
will be a opportunity for her to make these announcements in a
different format. Can we have a debate on the
increasing threat to endanger wildlife throughout the world? Is
my right honourable friend aware that growing demand for ivory in
China is causing endanger African elephants to be butchered in ever 
increasing numbers? If we cannot have a debate, will the Government
at least tell the Chinese that all civilised countries in the world
want to see an end to this sickening, barbaric and illegal
trade? I entirely endorse what my right
honourable friend has just said. I will draw his remarks to the
attention of the Foreign Secretary who will want to respond in
appropriate diplomatic language to the Chinese. On his broader point,
it will be possible for the backbench business committee to
listen to his representations that the House should debate this
crucial matter. I hope that on a Tuesday morning it will be
appropriate for him to present himself to the honourable lady and
her committee. Could we have a debate on the
efficiency of the Cabinet Office, which appears to have gone a bit
rusty since my day? They have double booked the Deputy Prime
Minister! He has an important piece of legislation next week and he has
cancelled a trip to Brazil. How much has it cost?
The reason why we are debating the Bill next week rather than earlier
is because of the performance of his colleagues in another place.
They have quite frankly taken much longer to process the bill than
they need to. My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister is,
as I expect the honourable member would expect, putting the House
first next week. Could we have a debate, led by the
Leader of the House, on the conduct of members in this chamber? This
follows an the revelations that a member who happens to have a
disability was subject to mimicry, face pulling and jeering. The
response was, at some of those members known that that member had
a disability, they would not have done it? But the inference is that
they still feel that this is acceptable. It is not, let's stamp
it out. I think I'm verging on the
responsibilities of you, Mr Speaker, in commenting on the performance of
members in the House. But I'm sure members on all sides will condemn
the way that my honourable friend was treated when he made that
speech on the child trust fund. I very much hope there will be no
recurrence of that incident. On the general point about behaviour in
the chamber, responsibility for that happily rests with you, Mr
Speaker, and not with me. Hazel Blears.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister last week made an
important speech about the need to tackle extremist Muslim ideology
last week. At the same time I hear there are significant cuts to the
organisation which is the counter extremist organisation. Will the
leader ensure there is a debate about how we tackle these complex
and difficult issues and the role it plays in tackling this difficult
issue? Are joined the lady in paying
tribute to the equally him Foundation, which does he wrote
work in this area.    Quillium Forced. I hope there will be broad
endorsement on what the Prime Minister says about
multiculturalism. We cannot allow extremistss to cultivate their
message and challenge. I would welcome a debate on that subject.  
  unchallenged. Could we find time for a short
debate about the role of committee of selection? Will he confirm that
he is aware that one of how honourable friends, who was elected
to this House to major on the health service, was apparently
asked by a whip and a minister to decline from tabling any amendments,
or speaking in that committee, or she would not be appointed to that
committee? I understand she has not been appointed to that committee.
Would he agree that... We are all grown up, we know that whipping
happens. But are they not limits to how much whips and ministers should
be seeking to influence the scrutiny process, does this not
make the case for making the Select Committee in question elected
rather than full of people appointed by the usual channels?
I say to my honourable friend, I heard the speech which my
honourable friend the Member for Totnes made in the debate in
Westminster Hall last Thursday on parliamentary reform, when she
shared with those in Westminster Hall her disappointment at not
being appointed to the public bill stage of the health committee. I
sat on the committee of selection probably for longer than anyone
else in this chamber, as a Non whip. There was a Bateman cartoon moment
when I called a division, which apparently had not been done in the
committee of selection for a very long time. Speaking personally, I
think that every honourable member should have the right to put their
case to the committee of selection, that they should be considered for
service on the bill, then it is a matter for the committee of
selection to decide. I personally would welcome the presence of the
committee of selection not just to business managers but also
representatives of backbenchers. Oh I am sure the House will join
with me in extending our sympathy to those who have been killed this
morning in the crash of the Belfast to Cork flight, and extend best
wishes for the recovery of those injured. On the issue of the
House's business, could we have a debate on government time before
the Budget on the high price of fuel in Northern Ireland, domestic
heating oil and the prices at the pump for diesel and petrol, the
highest in the UK? I'm sure the whole House will share
the sentiments the right honourable member has just expressed about the
casualties in the aircraft crash at Cork, and our good wishes for the
survivors. We did actually have a debate last but on precisely the
subject the right honourable gentleman has mentioned, the high
price of domestic heating oil, which was answered by my honourable
friend from.    my honourable friend. He might like to apply for
an adjournment which might focus on the specifics in Northern Ireland.
In Warwickshire, the number of people employed in manufacturing
has fallen from 34,000 in 2001, to just over 26,000 in 2009, a fall of
almost 25%. As the latest business report, trade and investment for
growth, made clear, boosting manufacturing is vital to increase
in employment and also rebalancing our economy. Will the Leader of the
House provide government time for a debate on how we can achieve the
manufacturing growth that is so essential to our economy?
I endorse the sentiments my honourable friend has just
expressed and say to him that next Thursday there will be the
opportunity to raise this where the Business Secretary will be at the
dispatch box. We have acted to improve the environment for
manufacturers with low and simpler business taxes, investment in
apprenticeships, wider access to finance and a Government White
commitment to boosting exports and the regional growth fund.
Early day motion 1367 has received much support. It calls on the
Government to honour military government and give our disabled
soldiers RP I rather than see p I increases on their pensions. Our
service man who have done their duty are being let down where they
need is greatest. Will the Government please allow time for an
debate on this so that we can ensure a fair deal for our services
families? A pay tribute to our armed forces
and I will soon publish a new armed forces covenant, the first of its
kind, setting out the relationship between the armed forces committee,
the Government and the nation. As the honourable member may know, the
Armed forces Bill going through the House currently does place on the
Secretary of State a commitment to lay before Parliament every year a
report on what is being done to live up to the covenant. He will
have heard the Prime Minister yesterday, at the dispatch box,
outlining the steps we have taken to support our armed forces.
With co ordinated strike action being planned by the pay masters of
the benches opposite, the trade union movement, can the Leader of
the House make government time available for a debate on the
reform of trade union laws? Well, if my honourable friend looks
at the Queen's Speech, she will realise that we are not planning
any reform of trade union law in this session of Parliament. Which
is already fairly congested. However, I would welcome a debate,
perhaps in backbench time, on the relationship between the trade
unions, society generally, and this House. I hope that in that debate,
moderate elements within the trade unions will put their case forward
and see off some of the hot head. Last August I received a
information that ministers had plans to cut one hand and 65 jobs
at the F I D in East Kilbride. At that time I was accused of
scaremongering and putting information into the public domain
which was wholly inaccurate. At 1030 this morning the staff at D F
I D were told that over 140 jobs will be lost in that office.
Therefore can I ask the Leader of the House to confirm to me that the
F I D ministers will make a statement to the House explaining
why these and look job losses have taken place, the impact on
multilateral and bilateral aid reduce, and that we make an apology
to the staff there in East Kilbride and me for misleading them last
year? And I say to the honourable member,
of course I understand his concern about the losses of jobs in his
constituency. Next Wednesday there is half an hour of questions to the
ministers were there will be an opportunity for him to raise the
subject. I will that the Secretary of State know that the honourable
member is likely to be in his place and raised the important issue he
has just referred to. May I endorse what the right
honourable lady for Salford and Eccles said about the cuts to the
grant to the William Foundation and call for a statement that, whilst
welcoming the Leader of the House's response to her, may I point out to
him that there is a great difference between a six figure sum
of about £124,000 per year, and a six figure sum in excess of
£800,000 per year? The right honourable lady did very important
work on this matter when she was a Cabinet minister, and her views
deserved to be listened to very attentively.
I'm grateful. I repeat what I said to the right honourable lady. The
Home Office does receive a wide range of bids for funding from many
organisations, and as with other areas of public spending, this a   
funding is subject to effectiveness assessment. I will make sure the
Home Secretary is aware of the very strong views in this House on this
ground. In response to the shadow leader's
question on the settlement bill, the Leader of the House said it was
government intention not to proceed until they had secured the Elise
and. Not withstanding the fact that that is a matter for the Scottish
Parliament, can we have a guarantee that the committee stage of the
Scotland Bill will not proceed until the Scottish Parliament have
finished their deliberations, and Elsie and has been voted for?   
LCM. I prefer to rest on the answer I
gave. It is indeed our intention to secured that before we proceed to
committee stage. A recent e mail to members
regarding the stop high speed to campaign was riddled with
inaccuracies. This link is absolutely essential to promote
investment in Northern constituencies like mind but there
appears to be a rag tag Alliance of Luddite making ludicrous arguments
against the plans. Can we have a debate on a high speed rail so that
The Attorney General will have you heard the robust language. I think
I'm right in saying there is a bid to the back bench business to
Committee for a debate. Can I remind him, it is the Government's
per solace    policy to pursue with disinvestment. Could we have a
debate on a Big Society and the yawning gap between the Prime
Minister's warm words and the reality of Home Start is a
wonderful charity working with the most vulnerable families. It has
been repeatedly praised by the Prime Minister yet 70 of its
branches including mine in Exeter are having their funding completely
withdrawn and to many of those are closing. Is that really what he
means by the Big Society? He will recognise there are some 3 million
people in this country who want to volunteer that at the moment are
not. There is an untapped potential we want to unlock through the Big
Society initiative. There is a good tradition in this country of
volunteering and it is right for the Government to try and develop
that at this moment. Can we have a debate on financial code of bonuses
which was introduced on 1st January? The Chancellor has
introduced a tougher code of any size in the world but most
importantly should encourage behaviour that create value by
bonuses been deferred for three years and been linked to
performance and being taken the shares which can go down as well as
up? He is absolutely right. On he may have heard a statement the
Chancellor made yesterday when he contrasted the lack of success in
the previous Government in getting a number of banks to sign up to the
code with a large number we have persuaded to sign up to the code
which is one of the toughest codes in Europe. Can I add my voice to a
call for a debate on the Prime Minister's important speech so we
can discuss a much stronger sense of what it means to be British
based on the contribution people are prepared to make, whether they
want to work hard, prepared to speak English because that is the
only way you can play a full role in British society. I welcome the
contribution he has just made which is very much in the same vein as my
right honourable friend. I would welcome such a debate and I think
there is an appetite for it in the House. We should be clear what is
meant by him distinguishing Islamist extremism, but political
ideology from Islam. We need to be genuinely liberal country like this
one that believes in certain values and we should do more to promote
them. Greenfield sites in my constituency and across Leeds and
are being lost to development despite being turned down by local
councillors. Can we have an urgent debate on how to preserve the site
and reintroduce a sequential approach to planning particularly
during the interim period while the Localism Bill goes through
Parliament? My honourable friend will welcome the provisions in the
Localism Bill which will give much greater weight to the views of
local people than the present arrangement. He raises a key issue
about what happens before the Localism Bill kicks in and I will
draw his remarks to the attention of the Secretary of State. Him view
of recent events in Sudan, most of them positive, but still in a very
challenging context, would the Leader of the House agree there
ought to the debate here on the floor of the House so as many
members who are interested in this important issue can participate?
understand what the right honourable gentleman is saying
which is reinforcing a remark made by the Member for Mid Sussex, there
is an appetite and House to debate the matters in the Middle East. I
would like to see if we can find an appropriate opportunity for the
House to share his views on these important issues.
As a proud trade union members not affiliated to the Labour Party,
will the Leader of the House find time for debates on the safety of
NHS workers. Many nurses in my constituency in Harlow work alone
late into the night, they are not always given at safety equipment
and not allowed travelling companions. Can he write to the
Health Secretary to raise this issue? I'm also an on trade union
member, I was expelled the 1970s and described as a pin striped
bovver boy. I say to my honourable friend who raises this serious
issue about the safety of staff working on their own for the NHS,
it does have a responsibility to look after its staff. The
management services rule out an alarm protection service for staff
who work alone and employers can take advantage of this by providing
staff who work alone with alarms. His PCT has taken advantage of this
service. In his business statement, it implies on Tuesday we get a
chance to debate the Lords amendments in relation to the
threshold before the referendum on AV would become mandatory. As an
electoral reform on myself, I want to see the referendum Bill through
AVM boating but in a difficult to accept it would be a compulsory
result on a low turnout. Can he tell the House what the
Government's attitude is likely to be on this on Tuesday? And right in
saying when we debate it, his front bench was against age threshold and
that remains the position of the Government. There will be an
opportunity on Tuesday, as I indicated, for House to debate the
Lords the Belmont    amendments including the one on the threshold.
In the light of the Commons of the Shadow Chancellor claiming UK do
not have a structural deficit before the recession and figures
showed the the than in every year from 2001 onwards, camp we have a
debate on facing up to reality? had that debate on Tuesday when the
Chancellor took the Shadow Chancellor to task. For the Shadow
Chancellor to deny there was a structural deficit even before the
banking crisis is simply to deny reality.
Yesterday the Government chief scientist Sir John Beddington
launched the foresight project's report on global food and farming
futures. Could we have a debate in Government time to consider the
implications of this report and its effects on climate change,
biodiversity, poverty, hunger and water shortages throughout the
world? At I understand his concerned and
it is an important report. Can he puts in an application for a debate
in Westminster Hall which will be well attended in view of the
subjects he has raised. My right Hon will friend will be
aware of the concerns of commuters in Norfolk and Suffolk about the
effects of coastal erosion. One of the ways of addressing that is
establishing a community and solidarity fund to pay for
preventative measures. Can confirm the Government support this
approach and an early debate on this issue. Local authorities
already have the necessary powers to raise funds and carry out
coastal erosion work. If there are any barriers to the initiative that
he has referred to, the Government will be happy to discuss them with
him. I wonder if the Leader of the House
can find time for a debate about the unfairness we're facing, the
half million women who were born between six October, who have to
wait one year to receive the state retirement age because of the
acceleration of the raising of the age to 66 and particularly those on
six may and June 1954 bit calf    before they can receive their
retirement. I understand her strong views on behalf of those who are
caught in the particular gap she has referred to. There are deja
groupie questions on Monday a win ore we have a debate and
International Women's Day. I do not want to pre empt any decision by
the Backbench Business Committee but that would be an appropriate
subject if such a debate took place. Can I draw your attention to my in
cheek in the Members' interests as a board member of the Social
Investment Business asked there leader for debate in Government
time about yesterday's fantastic news about £200 million worth of
private sector money going into the Big Society bank. I'm sure it is a
debate which all members of this House will want to come along and
welcome, particularly the Leader of the Opposition who tried to get it
going into 1007 when he was at the Cabinet Office. I agree it would be
a well supported debate. She underlined the point that we have
managed to secured that from the banks. Something which the members
opposite totally failed to do. That £200 billion, a huge sum of money
will be put a fantastic used by those who believe in the Big
Society. Given the fact it is the low paid
and those people on low incomes who are paying the highest price for
the cuts, and the fact that the people who calls this cut, the
bankers, are bankrolling the Tory Party, given the fact those bankers
and now enjoying better and higher bonuses and tax cuts, can we have a
debate who is generating the economic policies of this
Government, the bankers of the Government?
It is no use going on and on just blaming the bankers. If you look at
the position this country was in before the banking crisis, we are
running a huge structural deficit. There is no conviction at all when
members opposite try to blame the banks, they are responsible for the
difficult decisions we are now taking. As far as and bonuses, his
party did nothing about bonuses. They oblige the banks to go on
paying market rate bonuses, we have got a reduction. Can we have an
urgent debate on the performance of South Eastern trains so the
performance figures can be scrutinised on the floor of the
House because many of my constituencies our...
They're not getting the service they are entitled to from the
south east trains. There is a provision for a two year extension
subject to a continuation review where performance is assessed and
the performance data provided to assess his subject to rigorous
audit by a performance analysts in the Department of Transport. He
expects to notify the outcome of this review into cost and our job
to Marks to his attention. When the Leader of the House allow
time to discuss the alarming changes imposed upon employees of
the House of Commons and Parliamentary Staff in relation to
their terms and conditions and also including the long serving    long 
service award of 30 years? I think that might be a matter for
the House of Commons commission to discuss if relates to the
employment of House of Commons staff and I'm sure they would be
happy to receive a letter from the honourable member to pursue his
case further. Can we have a debate to convey the concerns of this
House in the plight of a man imprisoned in Afghanistan in jail
and is facing execution for being a Christian and given the essence,
the timing and sensitivity of this, can I ask the Leader of the House
to raise this issue and the highest levels so we can put an end to the
scene this act? This is a terrible case, denying the right of freedom
of religion. We will indeed continued to remind the Afghan
Government of its duty to apply    abides by commitments of freedom of
religion. I will draw his remarks to the attention of the Foreign
Secretary. Many hundreds of pensioners have written to me with
concerns about the public sector pensions in the future been
increased by CPI rather than RPI. Can we have an urgent debate on
this urgent issue? The refers to a decision that affects all public
sector pensions. We have the date of the budget next month. There
will normally be an opportunity in the budget debate to make the issue
he has referred to. Can ask if we can have a debate on
social care with particular relevant    relevance to personal
budgets and how the impact the quality and range of providers?
attach great importance to social care that is why £1 billion extra
has been found to invest in social care. Personal directed sport,
postal budgets enable a better tailored service to receivers and
that is part of our agenda to drive a Ford and move away from the set
menu that many local authorities offer and have a much more diverse
range of providers so people can May we have a debate on knife crime,
a serious concern to my constituents? In 2008 2009, 80% of
the knife criminals escaped jail. With the report of knife crime
crusader Brooke Kinsella, this would be a good time for the House
to debate it? I cannot promise a debate but my
right honourable friend rightly draws attention to the initiative
of Brooke Kinsella. The Home Secretary is responding to that
particular report. Under Labour there were over 100 serious knife
crimes per day. We want to reduce that figure.
Can we have an urgent debate about the size of the national debt, and
will the Leader of the House please ensure that the debate is quite
enough to look at Historic terms in the growth of this debate? When the
Leader of the Opposition was born, national debt stood at £612 per
person in this country where it is now at over £12,000.
The honourable members opposite said they are concerned that the
Government is selling out on the next generation but he has reminded
the House very graphic leader of the debt we are passing on to our
children and grandchildren. One of the reasons we want to take steps
on the deficit is to reduce the burden on the next generation.
Would my right honourable friend the leader consider sorting out the
have to struggle through 245 members who are going through the
cue from letter it G two Letter m have a far tougher time than those
going through the other queue? The answer to the problem is to promote
all those honourable members whose surnames begin with M to his own
cue, which would still be the smallest? Divisions would still be
far less easy    far less lengthy? I wish to speak up for the minority
whose names begin with S or said.     Z. Having a name beginning with
the letter why is a serious disadvantage it in every election I
have fought and a small compensation for that is that I
