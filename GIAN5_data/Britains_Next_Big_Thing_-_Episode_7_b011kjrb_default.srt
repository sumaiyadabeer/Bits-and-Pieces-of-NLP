London department store Liberty,
Britain's biggest health and beauty chain, Boots,
and home retailer Habitat.
The buying teams from these three high street giants
are on one mission   to find their next best seller.
Of the hundreds who pitched their ideas
only a few survived to face the fresh challenges ahead.
I'd expect these to be more flat, so you get a better meet on the side.
Stop making excuses. It's always somebody else's fault.
It is likely that the product will burn.
Time now to find out what happened to our retail hopefuls. Who got the deals?
We wouldn't have thought we could have done it, no.
And who failed to make the grade?
  You think the business could have carried on and you'd have got the product out?
  There's no doubt.
And as products hit the shelves,
long held dreams are finally realised.
  Congratulations!
  Cheers, Theo.
  Well done.
Get to it. Get those punters in!
What you have got is a product that seems to want to go places.
There's no reason why we shouldn't place orders for thousands next time.
Every shop on every high street
wants to find the Holy Grail of retail  
that next best selling product that will fly off the shelves.
But getting a product to market
and catching the eye of the great British public is not easy.
It's very rare that you become an overnight success.
You need time, perseverance and true grit.
Think ahead, think strategically and above all else, play the long game.
Getting into a big high street store
promises to boost the fortunes of any fledgling supplier.
With Liberty turning over around £60 million a year
it pays to get a product in store as quickly as possible.
Some of the open day hopefuls have already succeeded
like Charlotte Sale, with her glass splashes
and Tom Hopkins Gibson's delicate ceramics.
They're about to be joined by Professor Richard Weston
whose mineral print scarves might be the next big thing in ladies' accessories.
The scarves are in Liberty's.
I can hardly believe it after all this time!
It's fantastic.
Before the scarves make their debut
Richard has been invited to brief the sales team.
Three fifths of me is Professor of Architecture at Cardiff University
and two fifths does this.
I think this is the only jacket in the world lined with meteorite.
I think they can hold their own against a lot of big name designers.
You know, nature is suddenly
  the world's biggest name
  designer,
  at least for a day.
Get to it. Go to it, sales team!
Get those punters in!
He's like a young designer, but not a young designer.
He's going through a really, really interesting stage in his life.
What makes him different from a lot of designers that we work with
is that he asks a lot of questions, he really wants to get it right.
I have to say, he's been great to work with.
I expect the scarves to be, really, among our top sellers.
They're colourful, they're unusual.
I'd be really, really disappointed
if it wasn't in our top handful of scarf resources, going forward.
With the doors thrown open to the public a few days later,
Richard's passion for the natural world is put to practical use.
Is it underwater? Is it mountains?
Is it, you know, it's just kind of...
Today I'm in Liberty's to meet and greet customers, hopefully,
who are interested in the scarves, tell them a bit about the background of where they come from,
explain what's in the cabinets and let them see the man who's behind the madness, I guess.
2004. I started with leaves and then went on to fossils and minerals.
Those, you will be interested to know, are scanned
by being covered in Johnson's Baby Oil.
On top of the initial order for 192 scarves,
the store has already re ordered 200
before a single one has sold.
Now it's the scarves that will have to do the talking if they're to become a hit with customers.
  There's a postcard for you.
  Lovely, thank you very much!
It's going, I have to say, better than I dared hope.
That's my impression.
People are actually parting with serious money
cos they seriously like these things.
I think one is adding a little to human happiness. That's a small price!
With each scarf retailing for £150,
a Richard Weston original is priced at the upper end of fashion accessories.
Thank you for putting your faith in it. Not to mention your pounds.
This is just the beginning. I'm having conversations with him now
about what our optimal orders are,
how we can actually increase business for both of us
and actually start placing bigger orders, bigger production.
There's no reason why we shouldn't be placing orders for thousands next time.
With Professor Weston finally on the shop floor,
Theo visits the scarf room for a last word with the accessory department's newest fixture.
  There I am.
  Weston. Style icon!
  Style icon!
  Well... Some people are born to it, Theo.
Stella McCartney, Yves St Laurent... Richard Weston.
There we go.
How do you feel about this?
Pretty good, and the fact is, people are buying them, which is even better.
People will actually part with their money
for what I believed in for the last few years,
so that's quite satisfying.
If you could, what is it that you would do differently?
I think this has gone extremely smoothly, so far.
I really do, and I feel comfortable with where I'm at.
What I am not so sure about is where I go next.
But you seem to have done very well without knowing which way you're gonna go so far.
If I was you, I'd ride with the punches and go with the wind
because what you have is a product that seems to want to go places.
I think it's got legs, definitely.
Not all the Open Day hopefuls have made it into store.
For some, actually finishing their prototype is proving a challenge.
Recent graduates Robin Shannon and Stephen Morgan
wowed the Liberty buyers with their prototype lamp, five months ago at the Open Day.
  I love it, I really do.
  Cool. We're really, really proud.
Since then, they have displayed many qualities   confidence...
Once we're not trying to explain it with drawings, and it's there, they'll find it hard to say no to.
I think you'll find they can say no really easily. Do not EVER think that!
  ..positive thinking...
  We do believe that we can make it.
Really, anyone can design something. Sort of get it into the shops.
  ..and honesty.
  Someone left this off the drawing.
Our CAD technician at the studio. What a moron. That was me.
But there's been one crucial quality missing  
efficiency.
Not only have they missed the deadline to complete the lamp by nine weeks,
they also kept buyer Michelle Alger out of the loop.
I'd have expected them to have chased me quite a bit more.
I feel that I've forgotten them and they've forgotten me.
I think if they don't deliver the goods and come to me
with some more information, then I won't order it.
It's just taking forever!
Concerned that Stephen and Robin's relaxed attitude to business
is threatening their potential deal, Theo pays them a visit.
When I was last here, Stephen and Robin had given themselves
a 30 day deadline to get their product in a final state
where they could actually present it to the buyer at Liberty, Michelle.
I wonder how they're getting on, cos that was 13 weeks ago.
Chaps, last time I saw you, you gave yourselves four weeks
  to get this baby done, dusted.
  Yep.
  Did you make it?
Well, that might have been a slight naive assumption there, to think
we might have been able to get both of the products ready in four weeks.
So...no, we didn't.
That was definitely a no, was it?
That was 13 weeks ago, so what have you been doing?
  Was it 13?
  Believe me, it was 13 weeks.
We have actually resolved the issues
which she did say about the cable, tassels and the packaging. Right.
So those three were done, but we weren't happy with the power supply,
so that's what has taken us back a little bit.
So you haven't presented it yet? No. Have you been in touch with her?
We are going to follow up with an e mail, once we know...
Have you been in touch with her?
Not since the, er, four weeks.
  Did you get in touch after four weeks and say, "I'm gonna be late"?
  Well...
Did you get in touch with her?
Yeah, we've liaised with Michelle and we told her that...
We haven't just left her completely in the dark,
cos she always knew that we didn't actually set a complete date
on when we were next going to meet her.
She won't wait for you forever   the seasons go,
new product comes, they see new people.
They've only got so much money they can spend on products.
They won't wait for you to get your act together.
You are being treated with kid gloves by Liberty.
I've never seen anyone be treated so easily.
I know in most organisations that I've been associated with
if you don't deliver on time, you're out.
This is all part of the learning curve. This is our first product
that we are delivering this way, so hopefully the mistakes and the sort of missing deadlines
that we are doing now, in the future will...
Cos you won't have a business otherwise.
You're here to make money
and commercial ventures have to deliver with timelines on time.
If you don't, I promise you, you will lose customers so fast
and you've worked so hard to get a customer, to lose them would be tragic.
  It would be tragic and soul destroying as well.
  So you're full steam ahead now? Yeah.
  I thought we were going full steam ahead before.
  We'll find some more steam from somewhere.
A lot more steam.
I don't know what to make of those two. I love them dearly,
but with any other retailer, you know what,
they would have been slaughtered. They would have been out of those doors in a heartbeat.
But let's wait and see.
In six weeks' time, let's see if they can get that prototype ready for Liberty.
Some of the novice suppliers
have moved well beyond the prototype stage.
Boots hopeful Louise Day came up with the idea for her baby sling
three years ago, after the birth of the first of her two children.
When we designed the prototype the inspiration behind it
was my first son, Charlie, and how he wanted to be carried,
and the kind of things that we did day to day together
just inspired the type of sling that we created.
Selling the slings online and at baby shows for around £50 each,
Louise has managed to keep the business afloat.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Hi.
You're quite happy in there.
Oh, he's been sick on your neck.
Dealing with the business side hasn't been too hard, really.
I was a management accountant before I came into this,
before I had babies and decided I didn't want to go back
to that kind of life, so it's not been too difficult.
Success may have come easily so far,
but the difference between retailing at one off baby fairs
and selling on every high street in Britain is a big one.
Estimated to be worth in excess of £630 million a year,
the baby market is booming.
So it's no surprise that Britain's biggest health and beauty retailer
is keen to expand this area of business.
I'm actually the founder and designer of the Lifft baby sling...
At the open day, Louise's sling proved popular with the buyers.
We love the product.
It fills a gap, but obviously, as you know,
  we'd have to take it through a lot of intensive testing.
  Absolutely.
Product testing is important for any retailer,
but for a health and beauty chain like Boots,
who trades on its reputation for trust, it's vital.
The future of the Lifft sling is in the hands
of one of the most powerful men in retail  
Product Safety Assessor Stuart Walker.
It is likely that the product will burn, so I have to be prepared.
The chain is unique for doing its safety testing in house,
and Stuart's findings will be taken extremely seriously.
Excellent, I'm quite happy with that.
We're just trying to simulate what will happen when the child
is put into the sling, and just see if it moves around too much.
Next is the strength test.
The weight recommended for the sling is up to 35lbs.
We're actually going to put in 44lbs,
because we know some children may be larger
and people may try and carry a larger child than is ideal.
Certainly an unusual arrangement, I've not come across it before.
Not too bad.
So far, so good.
But fail any of the tests,
and the baby carrier will be dropped by the high street store.
So we're going to try a dry rubbing test.
This fabric will come into contact with a shirt, a coat,
with the child's clothing, so what we need to know
is that there'll be no colour transfer between the two.
The threat of losing a deal is a real one.
Another of the Open Day hopefuls, Birgitte Lydum, lost out
when the ties on her baby product were deemed to be dangerously long.
OK, so there's clearly a transfer there.
So that's standing a chance of causing staining to clothing.
I think we'll have to do some more tests, though.
Louise can only wait and hope that Stuart's full technical report
will give the Lifft sling the green light it needs.
Stuart Jolley has long dreamed of seeing
his first business idea on the shelves of a high street store.
Taking your own idea which you thought up in your own head,
from that to a product which is going to be on a shelf
would be just brilliant.
At the Boots open day, Wingman, his wet wipes for men, impressed.
We think you've done a really good presentation,
and we really think it's worth
having a further conversation with you.
Wow, brilliant! Thank you very much.
Completely made our day.
But buyer Annabel Franks wanted a complete image overhaul.
Thank you, see you soon.
At the tender age of 23, Stuart is solely responsible
for the re design and manufacture of his product.
If you stop to think about it too much, you put yourself off it
and scare yourself, so I kind of see it as, "don't think about
"the pressures" or how much time I've put into it already.
With £20,000 of an investor's money sunk into the business,
he desperately needs a deal.
I'm not going to lie, it's kind of work through day and night,
lose sleep over it, but it'll hopefully be worth it.
The product has been thoroughly tested at the in house laboratory.
And, with the re design completed, Theo meets up with Stuart
to find out if it's a yes or no from the retailer.
Stuart, what I want to know is, have we got an order?
Am I going to buy the product in Boots?
  I want the answer to all those questions.
  This is it, Theo.
Yes, it is the birth of a new brand. I've even got the prototypes with me today.
  We've got the two pack.
  How much is it going to sell for?
With this one it's going to sell for £1.19.
Let's put that there to see what it looks like.
It's a sexy brand.
Steady, steady!
And how many have we got in here?
Eight individually wrapped wipes.
And how much is this going to sell for?
That's going to RRP for £3.49.
6 million question   how big's this order?
It's going to be 8,000 of the two packs
and it's going to be 6,500 of the eight packs.
With the first order worth about £12,000,
Stuart is in business.
So, how do you feel?
It's been tough, I'm not going to lie, Theo.
It's was sort of up and down, it's been a crash course in business.
It's just been really, really hard work from day one.
And do you know up to date
how much you've invested in hard cash on this product?
Up to about £20,000.
Will that be covered by your first order?
  No, we lose about £8,000.
  So if you get a second order, you're quids in?
  Smile!
  Hopefully, yeah.
  Smile!
If you get a second order, you've got all your money back and you're in profit.
It doesn't get better than that, does it?
No, I'd be dead chuffed, Theo, I'd be on top of the world.
  Congratulations!
  Cheers, Theo.
  Well done.
I'm full of admiration for Stuart.
He's had a long and arduous journey,
but he's got his product in Boots, and from this first order alone
he's in danger of getting his investment back.
Second order, he goes into profit.
When I was talking to him earlier, he said he'd been lucky.
Well, the harder you work, the luckier you get.
Stuart's re design of the wet wipes was time and money well spent.
The challenge for any supplier is to create a product
that sells itself the moment a customer sets eyes on it.
You've got to put as much effort in your packaging as you do in designing your product.
And always remember to budget for the cost
or otherwise you can seriously destroy your margin.
There's three things to remember.
One   it's got to look good and attract the eye.
Two   it's got to say what it does on the tin.
And three   size.
Keep packaging to a minimum, because retailers put a high premium on shelf space,
and if it's too big, you're likely to get a smaller order.
Ceramicist Catherine Gray is a stranger to mass production.
More used to making small runs of her handmade vases,
she charges up to £195 for each one, so they have to be perfect.
I wouldn't want to be putting something out
unless I was really happy with it.
I've always been like that.
I don't kind of just pop things out and think, "Oh, that'll do."
They have to be good.
Catherine needed to modify the design
so that she can carry on selling her bespoke vases
while the retailer sells a different version for a quarter of the price.
So this is how they'll be...
This is the first prototype and we'll see in Italy
the actual production, but those are the three sizes.
  So tell us your first impressions?
  First impression's fantastic, love 'em.
With the re design agreed,
Catherine accompanies Head of Buying Ros Nelson and Creative Director Theo Williams
to the manufacturer in Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.
The town, which is six miles north of Florence,
has been famous for its potteries for over 250 years
and is home to over 100 factories.
This is what it's about. You might think you've got an idea,
but when you turn up in a place like this, it can be transformed into a better idea.
With Catherine, it's a bit of a surprise.
This is her first trip to Italy, let alone to a company like this,
who's got this vast array of things that we can choose and use.
But that is important, that they get contact with manufacturers a bit earlier.
A lot of designers should do.
This will be the last chance to make adjustments
before 1,500 of the vases are mass produced.
  Whoa, that's great.
  OK, thank you.
  I'm liking that.
In the year since I graduated, I've come so far.
I mean, I was lucky to be picked in the first place
and now here I am at the factory in Italy
to see my product being made.
  What do you think?
  This is very close to the original colour, so...
  That's good.
Yeah, I mean, we know that that works.
It does feel really weird being here in a factory in the middle of Italy,
you know, from my little studio in Bristol.
Let's have a look. There are a few tweaks that we need to make for the samples
so I've got a few things that I need to make sure they're doing how I want them to be done.
For someone used to working alone, it's a new experience
trying to communicate her exact ideas to a whole team of people.
Usually, I'd expect those would be more flat so you'd get a better meet on either side.
  I have got to ask about how we're looking at this eye.
I'm just a little bit...not sure about the positioning of that eye,
and I don't know if that can be tweaked.
  So is it the positioning that you want us to...?
  Just a little bit.
  Tilted on one side.
  Yeah.
  So we're looking at it being sort of...
  Maybe not such a rake.
So if that came up to here, so that point...
That point comes up to there.
  Un problema.
  Yeah.
  Yeah, it's a little problem.
Of course, it's important that the designer gets input on every phase,
and today really we're just at probably the end point
where we're deciding on the intensity of the colour,
some of the details of the finish, etc,
and it's an opportunity for the designer to put that final finish.
It is quite a personal thing, just looking at the decals
and the positioning of them, cos I'm so familiar with my daughter's face
and how those vases have looked before.
I just have to get them right and be able to put that over to them here.
Now we go to see where they glaze the product.
The kiln I've got at home, well, at my studio, is about this big
  and this tall, so I can get about 15...
  15 pieces?
  ..vases into it, yeah.
  How many can you get into there, do you reckon?
  The middle one, about 50 pieces every time.
When Paolo's making them, he's obviously got time restrictions
and that explains a lot of some of the problem areas that I was looking at
and that I flagged up, so I can see he doesn't have the time to indulge that I have.
Now Paolo finishing, we show you how it is before firing one more time in the kiln,
  and then it, er, completely finished product.
  Good.
  Ready for the sales.
  Lovely.
  Thank you, Paolo, that's great.
  Thank you. Grazie mille, grazie.
It's difficult with the quality, because there are some issues and I hope that they'll be resolved,
so, yeah, I expected that they would be better than my standard
and I didn't ever think I'd be able to find fault with these
which, unfortunately, there are some things on the samples which we've had to pick up
but I feel really confident that they're going to be able to remedy those.
For Catherine, turning her bespoke vases into something for the high street
has been an eye opening experience.
Design duo Stephen Morgan and Robin Shannon, who call themselves Show & Tell
were supposed to have put the finishing touches to their lamp over four months ago.
With a price tag of around £950,
Liberty buyer Michelle Alger
is expecting to see something really special when the designers unveil it tomorrow.
When I see the product, I want to see something that looks the value that they're trying to charge me
and I will be then charging my customers, so it needs to be of a really high quality,
not something that's been knocked up in a workshop.
It really needs to look high end.
With Stephen on holiday in Ibiza and the lamp still in pieces,
it's down to Robin to prepare for the biggest meeting of their careers.
So today I'm just doing the last little bit of assembly,
which involves joining up all the wire connections, linking them
to the EL panel and it should be fine, there's nothing
that complicated. It's just a case of sliding it all together,
so as long as the light comes on, we should be all good.
So this is the bit where the light should come on.
HE SIGHS I think one of these connections might have been loose,
so have another go. Hopefully the light will turn on.
Finally, the lamp lights up, but blink and you miss it.
OK, so tomorrow won't be a complete disaster.
Now we can walk in with a light that works. It might be a bit easier to sell. So it's OK.
Before the meeting tomorrow, there are a few more things on the to do list that need to be ticked off.
Changing the cable, getting the tassel sorted out,
and I can't remember what the third one was...
What were we doing? Tassel, cable...
Now we're sorted. What else was there...? And packaging   that's it. Nice one.
Oh, mate.
With the crucial meeting only a day away, Robin must keep his cool and
make sure the lamp is ready for its moment in the spotlight tomorrow.
In Nottingham, Louise Day is back at Boots HQ to find out
if her baby sling has a future with the store.
We sent about 10 slings in to be tested in the Boots laboratory
so I find out the results today about how the testing went.
But hopefully, I might get an order today.
There's a lot riding on this meeting with baby buyer, Natalie Walters,
and website buyer, Sally Ann Bergen, about to deliver their verdict.
Obviously we've been in contact about the testing
that was done on the Lifft Sling in our labs
and delighted to tell you that everything's passed, so that's brilliant.
So all the testing we did, all perfect.
Louise, I have to tell you...
I am really impressed with the Lifft Sling.
I really, really like it and I'm delighted to tell you that
  I would love to give you a listing.
  Thank you very much.
  You're welcome.
  That's not all. We would also like to stock it in some of our larger stores as well.
  Fabulous.
We'd like to get it out, it'd be fantastic to get it on shelves.
We really want to work with you to get that into some of our biggest shops.
  We're really excited about it.
  Brilliant, that's absolutely amazing.
I'm so glad I applied. THEY LAUGH
With 30 stores taking on the Lifft Sling and a spot on the website, Louise's prospects look good.
To be able to walk into Boots
and just see my product there will be absolutely amazing.
I'm going to take my friends and family, I think, when I know
it's in the shops, I'll take everybody and we'll all go and have a look.
But yeah, I can't wait for it.
Theo visits buyer Sarah Clark Martin to find out more about what the deal will mean.
How many of those are you ordering?
We'll be ordering a couple of thousand of these initially,
about 1,000 will go online, 1,000 will go in store.
  2,000 at £50 each.
  Yeah, £50 each, so it's not a bad size of business.
  So full retail price that's...
  £100,000. That's...
  Wow. It's a big product.
  That's a big product, yeah.
  There you are. Fabulous.
  I mean the market,
the baby market is massive, so if we take a portion of that,
  it's definitely a big business.
  And that's an initial order.
  That's an initial order.
  If they sell, you go back for more.
The quicker they sell, the more we order.
So, we've come to the end, how would you describe the open day?
I think it's been a fantastic experience.
It's given us products, access to products that we would never
have seen before and that's always really exciting.
From a financial point of view, what do you think it's going to yield for Boots?
If we add up the numbers we've been talking about,
with a few re orders it could be looking at over £¾ million worth of business.
Wow, so that day alone could bring £¾ million of turnover into Boots.
  Yep. It's not bad for one day's work, is it?
  Certainly worth doing.
  Yeah.
One designer with a few hoops to jump through
before her product gets in store is Laura Wellington.
  Nice to meet you.
  I'm Jonathan.
Laura's Hula lamps made from strips of plastic were an immediate hit
at the Habitat open day.
We like it a lot and congratulations. That's a very nice product.
Over the last few months, Laura has been working with
the retailer to slightly modify her original design and colour scheme.
I'm just two years after graduating and to go from that
to being on a Habitat shelf in two years is the most epic thing.
Today she's on her way to see a sample light being safety tested,
a crucial stage before full scale manufacture can begin.
It's really nerve racking
because you imagine it bursting into flames or something goes wrong.
Under the watchful eye of safety expert Mark Liddiard,
the Hula is tested for its resistance to heat.
It's a safety critical test so just basically to make sure
that in use the product doesn't ignite, catch fire.
And this piece of equipment measures the total amp output,
and there we have the Hula.
Until the results of all the tests are through,
Hula's future hangs in the balance and Laura is left in the dark.
It's really exciting. I think it's because you don't really know
what's going to happen, you don't know which way things will go
and I suppose it's just taking each day as it comes.
So far I've been really quite lucky,
like I've not really had many negative responses to my work.
That's probably cos I'm still quite fresh out of university,
probably still a little bit sheltered and not really in the big, bad commercial world.
Two other recent graduates are struggling with
the demands of that commercial world.
Robin and Stephen are finally on their way
to present their lamp to buyer Michelle Alger.
It's ready to be presented. The three issues that Michelle raised at our last meeting
have all been resolved, so yeah, we're confident going in that we've done what she asked us to do.
If she likes what she sees, Michelle will commit around £1,000
to an initial order of six small lamps and one large one.
If I don't have a good cost price or a finished product or the packaging
isn't up to scratch then, to be quite honest, I'm not going to be buying it.
They've had a good six months to pull this off
and quite honestly I can't wait any longer, my money will be spent elsewhere.
As they prepare for the presentation, disaster strikes.
Can't have a light that don't turn on.
Look. I should be getting electrocuted, but nothing's happened.
  Yeah, but you don't know if it's the switch.
  Yeah, but it turned on five minutes ago in here.
It's just a joke.
With Michelle's arrival now imminent, the future isn't looking so bright for the faulty lamp.
Let's have one more go. Can you just plug it in one last time, mate.
  Really.
  Yeah.
Yes, it turned on. Oh, my God.
Pass me a bit of that. We'll just explain it's a loose connection
and we've had to tape it...it's fine. Right. OK.
Sometimes you just have to take a deep breath,
double check what you've done
and cross your fingers and luckily it's come on, so...
With disaster averted, the designers seem oblivious to the problems
of presenting a luxury product held together with gaffer tape.
So show me. What have you done?
Right, well last time we talked about packaging, tassels and cable
and as you can see, the packaging has been sort of resolved, really,
  which is what you wanted.
  Fantastic. Can I see it lit, please?
It is actually on at the moment, but it's obviously quite light in here.
  My only concern is that...
  Yes.
  ..it's not illuminated at all.
  We could probably bump it up slightly brighter.
  Yeah, I mean to me, that's not even on.
  Right, OK.
So, erm, I think you just need to work on
pulling that up a little bit. Can I have a look at it and feel it?
Yeah. Shall I actually...
I can see now that you've switched it off. It makes, erm...
Is this going to be the quality of the finished piece?
No, the finished piece will be assembled outsourced,
so it will be to a much higher standard.
I still need to see a finished piece. It's not finished!
  Yeah, we completely understand that.
  Yeah.
  So how do you feel about the development, then?
  I think it's...
it's develop ing. It's not DEVELOPED yet.
I think it's, you know...
If anything, I'm disappointed because it's not finished.
Yeah, we really wanted to come here with a finished product.
I certainly wouldn't be able to take on anything
that's this sort of finish at the moment.
What should have been a meeting to clinch the deal,
has turned into an object lesson in how not to impress a buyer.
  How did it go in there?
  It's not a finished product.
  It's not something that's fit for retail. Just not anything, really.
  Are you disappointed?
Very, yes, really disappointed. Yeah, I thought these guys had something really great,
but it just hasn't really worked out that way.
With Michelle left more depressed than impressed, Theo is keen to get some answers from Stephen and Robin.
  How did it go?
  Well, let's go over the positives first.
She really liked the packaging, which was good. Um...
Also she commented on the fact that the EL needs to be brighter...
  Which is... Which is achievable.
Sounds like a very fundamental flaw in a light that doesn't light.
Well, you see, the thing is that it's an ambient mood light,
so you'd have it there as a sort of a feature of the room...
It kicks out quite a lot of light, it's just that right now, it's a bit hard to see.
Guys, come on.
  It's OK putting a brave face on things.
  Yeah.
But if it was me, I'd be disappointed.
You haven't delivered.
You've had more chances than you would get anywhere else.
Why are you so late?
Primarily because our suppliers are slow at getting us what we need,
and not only getting us what we need, but delivering it to a spec that we have given them.
Stop making excuses. It's always somebody else's fault.
The buck has to stop with you.
I think you've got an interesting product.
An interesting idea. You have failed miserably into turning it
  into a commercial idea.
  Right.
A business idea. Miserably.
That would be my impression.
And it is probably the impression of a lot of people.
Talent alone and good ideas alone cannot make a business.
You've got to get your backsides into gear.
Fair enough.
No regrets, I mean, maybe we could have been a bit more decisive
earlier on and pushed for things to get done a bit quicker and then we'd have had more time to sort out
these small problems before the meeting, but that's OK. We're still sort of learning every day, so...
Yeah, I completely agree. I mean it was a pretty stern talking to,
but if that was all it takes to put us off, then what are we doing anyway?
So, no, he's not put us off   he's just given us a direction to take.
With the optimism of youth, Robin and Stephen still believe
that their design business Show & Tell will make it.
Theo is not so sure.
I was really hard on Stephen and Robin,
but quite frankly, they really disappointed me.
They were given numerous golden opportunities
to get their product on this floor and they let each one go begging.
If they carry on like that, Show & Tell has no future.
Every retailer hopes to discover the next big thing.
The products that will make big money.
Theo visits Head Buyer, Ed Burstell, to find out what impact
the open day has had on the department store.
How would you assess the success of the open day?
It's been really amazing seeing the products being made,
being marketed, getting to the shop floor and most important selling.
What do you reckon you'll do at retail over the year?
Just because I thought you might ask that question I happen to have a few numbers here! And, yeah,
we placed... On ten people we placed £150,000 in initial orders.
We've had some really great check outs,
so I am predicting that we will actually beat that projection
in terms of sales on those ten we will do close to £600,000 in sales annually.
Even though it was an exhausting day, that's well worth it.
Incredible for a day's work.
It might all be in a day's work for the buyers,
but for the designers, there are months,
if not years, devoted to developing their products.
Over at the Habitat headquarters, senior design manager, Rachael Sleight,
has just taken delivery of the white version of the Hula lamp.
We're nearly there with all the final tweaking...
I've got one more sample to see, but this is the final material, so we should get
a very good impression when we see this on, providing it's all working.
Oh, yes, excellent.
It's got a very happy, fun feel to it. It's quite '60s in a way.
Aesthetically, we're very happy with the product.
It's light and airy and we shall still look into doing a coloured version, but we want
to take a bit more time to develop that and get the colour just right.
Great. Wow, it's going to make quite a statement when it's in situ.
The lamp passed the safety tests with flying colours and manufacturing will soon begin.
With 500 lights on order, Laura can finally call herself
a professional designer.
I'm really proud that I graduated two years
and I've managed to get into Habitat.
It still hasn't sunk in really, it feels a bit strange when people
keep saying, "it's amazing, it's so exciting", but I think I just...
It won't be until it's on the shelf that it'll finally sink in
and realise that it's real.
I am proud and I've made my mum and my dad proud and all my family
and that's a big thing.
The final sample of Catherine Gray's vases have arrived
back in Britain and are met by Head Buyer, Ros Nelson.
These are the last of the small ones. So, shall we have a look?
Ros and Senior Design Manager, Pip Prinsloo,
have been involved with the vases since day one of the project.
Start with the small ones.
  That's... Wow. Pretty bright.
  Ah, that's cool.
Oh, wow   that's great.
They catch the light a little bit differently, which is nice.
So an interesting turnaround, colour wise.
  So much better than the fuchsia one.
  That was just not the right colour.
  That's a lot more commercial.
  No   that looks really strong. Poppy, graphic and fun.
  Really great.
  I think it's one of the most successful projects.
  I hope so. I think it's strong.
  Good.
I would say that Catherine's anxiety
about achieving perfection was because she's accustomed
to making these products herself in her workshop,
but I think once she understood that our aim was to make sure that we produced something
that we would be equally as proud of, then she was absolutely fine.
She's been great to work with.
For Catherine, it's been an unforgettable experience.
I feel like I've kind of furthered my education over the last six months, you know,
definitely learning how the whole process works.
What it's like to be a designer, what you need to know,
what sort of things the retailers have to consider when they're looking at your designs.
It's been an amazing experience really. It's had ups and downs
but what I've learned, what I've gained,
how much I've developed on a personal level, has been tremendous,
and, you know, as far as my work goes, it's...
What better platform could I have, you know?
With the store producing an initial run of 1,500 vases,
it's a promising start for the new designer.
For the retailer, it's just one of several success stories from the open day.
Now, what I want to know, 6 million question, how would you assess the open day?
We are as pleased with it now as we were right at the beginning, really.
I've got more than £150,000 worth of retail commitment
booked already on the products that we've seen.
Probably triple that by the time we're finished.
  You reckon half a million.
  It could be.
It could be. If the products work, I think it's very likely.
From a design point of view, we picked what we considered are winners.
What I do like about what we picked is that the variations and
  versions we can grow on each season, so it's been pretty successful.
  Would you do it again?
Most definitely. The amount of new talent that we found that we probably
would never have seen, everything's quite different to what we've got in at the moment,
so for us, it's been great fun and we'd do it again.
To break into retail and succeed is a challenge and takes a lot of effort.
Everyone's experiences are different, but here's a few do's and don'ts to keep in mind.
Don't give away too much information whilst negotiating.
All the retailer needs to know is what it's going to cost them to buy the product,
  not what it costs you to make.
  I think the scarves would come down to something like £20 each.
  But that's your cost, isn't it?
  Absolutely.
  You're very honest.
  I'm being totally honest with you.
  The fact that he told me how much it actually cost
for him to get them made is quite unusual.
I think that's probably due to his inexperience of working with a retailer.
Don't buy masses of stock before you've got an order
or you could end up with a serious cash flow problem and a huge storage headache.
  So how much stock are you holding?
  Too much.
How much stock are you holding? Tell me   I need to know.
OK. About 2,500 frogs.
You're sitting on quite a large number of weeks' stock there,
which is quite scary.
When we say we've spent nearly £20,000, it's to do with our holding the stock.
How big are the boxes? Are they heavy? OK, so they're quite huge.
  Half a ton.
  (Oh, my God.)
They are going to fit in?
Do be realistic about timelines and make sure you stick to them.
If you don't, the retail buyer's budget will be spent elsewhere.
  Why are you so late?
  Primarily because our suppliers are slow at getting us what we need.
  Stop making excuses.
  You know they've had a good six months to pull this off
and quite honestly, I can't wait any longer.
Don't think of a new business purely on financial terms.
Establishing your name and getting a foot through the door
is far more important for a new business than making money early on.
It's important that nobody has misconceptions about being able
to retire to a sunny desert island off the back of one idea.
Your cost is nearly a hundred quid, plus labour.
  Yes, and I don't pay myself.
  That's not good.
  I know!
  So you're going to make less than a thousand quid?
  I'm not doing it for the money,
  I realise that now.
  Yes, you are.
Cos you're making it as a commercial venture. What you have done is marketed yourself.
Do be persistent. There's a lot of truth in that old adage,
"if at first you don't succeed, try and try again".
We'll get there, Maria. Small steps, and I like that, actually.
I like that it's going to be small, steady steps.
Thank you. Now, whatever happens,
if you've got a great product or a good idea, my advice to you is
take a deep breath, clear your diary for the next five years
and make sure, most important of all,
you get yourself in front of a buyer.
For some, getting in front of the buyers
didn't deliver a fairy tale ending.
Tracy Wood has spent the last ten years producing her home made eczema creams.
She developed them to relieve her baby daughter's chronic condition.
My daughter was so bad with her eczema, she couldn't get up
from the settee to play
when her friends came round to play with her.
Conventional treatments had no effect, but Tracy's home made formula seemed to help.
When I saw her clearing up, it was absolutely fantastic.
I couldn't believe it. I never dreamt it'd turn into a business for me.
Tracy felt her kitchen table business
was ready for the high street and the Boots open day
seemed like the perfect opportunity to make the leap.
  Hi, Tracy, do you want to come in?
  Tracy's passion shone through.
My life was eczema and I thought then, the creams aren't working
  I need to help my girl.
  But there was a fundamental problem.
Eczema claims are medical claims and they have to go through
so much testing and regulation.
  As it stands today, this isn't something that we could take into Boots as it is.
  Right.
It's no accident that most medicines are produced
by huge multi nationals.
  Medical testing costs hundreds of thousands of pounds.
  Tracy...
  are you disappointed?
  Very. I'm gutted. Absolutely gutted.
Theo visits Tracy four months after her rejection at the open day.
He wants to see how her business is faring without the hoped for order from the high street.
It's been hard, believe you me. There's been plenty of times I've thought I can't do this
any more, but I do it because it's what I do and I believe in it.
I can't understand, Tracy, why you haven't actually gone further with this.
If it's actually got these healing qualities, why aren't people breaking down your door?
The reason is when you've done a piece of publicity,
you get loads of orders, but then it dies down.
So when you were successful with it, and you were making the money,
why didn't you use that money to market more?
Because I unfortunately then split up with the children's father,
which took every single penny I had, because I needed to keep them
in the house they were living in, which I know from a business point
of view is probably not the best thing to do, but from a personal point of view,
my kids are very important, so that's the reason why I done it.
  And you ran out of money.
  Yeah.
  So if you had exposure
and had the money to market,
you think the business could've carried on and you would've got the product out there?
There's no doubt. SHE SOBS
How you going to get it out there to everybody?
I will see. I will keep trying to get some magazine articles,
  newspaper articles.
  And you're never going to give up, are you?
Never, because I'm passionate about it. It's what I've done
and it's helped my daughter and it's helped so many other people. This is what I do.
Wow, if ever someone deserves a break, that lady really does.
She's got a product, but the world doesn't know about it.
It's like having a shop that nobody can find.
If she can get the product out there, I really believe she's got a future.
For two other hopeful suppliers, rejection at the open day
had an unexpected result.
Sophie and Maria Law pitched their range of pre teen bras to Liberty.
Tell us everything, what do we have?
We have lingerie for young girls.
Head Buyer, Ed Burstell, gave the garments a lukewarm reception.
It's a surprise to me! I have to sleep on it.
With no children's department, and a decidedly adult approach to lingerie
the department store and the teen underwear were a bad fit.
It was down to Head of Fashion, Eleanor Robinson,
to break the bad news to the sisters in law.
We think that for us, with the lingerie department being
as grown up as it is, that it could be opening a whole can of worms.
It's probably not an area of business that we want to pursue at this point.
Of course it's a disappointment not to be in Liberty's
and to have that little...
You know, step up and... be on our way, but...
We've started, so we'll jump...
We'll make that jump, it just will take a bit more time.
It seemed like the end of the line for the bras
and with a debt of £20,000, it couldn't have been worse news.
But Sophie and Maria didn't give up on their search
for a suitable retailer.
They contacted a buyer from high street chain John Lewis.
Sweetling is really exciting, because it was something very new.
We've been looking for a while to find a really good teen bra
and we just thought, "ooh, this is a perfect product".
After 10 15 minutes, she just said, "I love this, I want it.
"That's it, girls, I'm coming to your studio to see it" and, erm...
  A week later, there she was!
  ..and she placed the orders.
Snapping up nearly all of Sophie and Maria's stockpile of 1,000 bras,
the shops have been doing a brisk trade ever since.
We've had about a week's worth of sales and with no publicity or anything around it
we've sold 20% of the stockholding in the first week, which is a fantastic result.
so fingers crossed it'll continue to perform well in the future.
Playing. Still playing!
They're still my babies, I want them to be perfect for every girl that gets in here and wants one.
There's one on the wrong hanger here.
We could be permanently employed here, just to look after our bras.
Although this model is too busty. She's too busty for this bra. Let's put the 32B on her.
We've only done what we've done because we've been so naive
and green that we've done it this way and it's been...
  It's like we've been skipping along blindly and it's been enjoyable.
  If we'd known how enormous
the whole retail and... I can't put it into words.
If we knew how enormous the mountain was to climb... If we saw it in front of us...
We've got to do these things before we can get there, we'd have said no way.
We wouldn't have thought we could have done it. No, no.
What are you doing?
Hey, that's better.
  It's not so...
  Stretched.
Would we do it again? Oh, I don't know, I feel so old now.
Yes, we would do it again.
Yes. Yes, it's been fun.
You're so clever. You're so clever   well done, you.
  I'm ecstatic that Sophie and Maria got their product to market.
Now, they did break a few rules on the way of course, like buying
their stock before they had an order, but they plugged their way
and it really paid off for them. Early signs are good.
Sales are robust and I think they've got a winner on their hands.
Of the suppliers who made it through the open days,
some have seen their products make it into store.
While others are still working towards that dream.
Against the odds, Steven Biddulph has nearly finalised a deal
with Habitat for his wobbly based Beeble stools.
They've agreed a run of 200 with each stool retailing for £130.
  I want to be one of your first customers.
  Fantastic.
Elaine Armstrong's towing device for children's bicycles
is not ready to go to market and is in product development in Hong Kong.
Debbie Evershed's Frog Bracket is being manufactured in China.
With an initial order of 1,500 and 3,500 to follow,
she looks to have made the leap from market stall to high street chain.
This deal is going to put the frog on the map!
Elaine Weston's teen skincare range continues to sell well online.
And scientists Dr Shamus Husheer and Oriane Chausiaux can celebrate
now that their ovulation predictor has been successfully tested and verified.
They are currently negotiating the terms of the deal.
Charlotte Sales's glass dishes are selling well,
but not quite well enough for her to give up her job as a legal secretary.
on their sixth re order, with a new collection in the pipeline.
Professor Richard Weston's designs have proved so successful
that he has already received re orders for 500 scarves and pashminas worth £95,000 retail.
Sometimes the passion I see from people when they have a good idea is staggering
and they'll follow that idea right to the end of the world to actually make it happen.
Over the past few months, I've seen it again and again. This is the way to succeed.
Now, only time will tell if any of the products discovered
at the open days will become the next big thing
on Britain's high streets.
