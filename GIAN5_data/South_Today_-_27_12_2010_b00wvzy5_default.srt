Good evening. I'm Allen Sinclair with the news from the South. The
Hampshire family of Joanna Yeates have been visiting the scene where
her body was found on Christmas Day. The family, from Ampfield near
Romsey, will have to wait until tomorrow for the results of a post
mortem examination. It's hoped it will reveal more details about how
the 25 year old landscape architect died. Her body was found a few
miles from her Bristol home. Despite the icy conditions,
shoppers queued in the early hours for the sales in Southampton,
Basingstoke and Milton Keynes. Many shops across the region opened from
5am, after the weather hit pre  Christmas takings. Laura Lyon
reports. With deals for half price and water be found, shoppers in
Witney were keen to hit the high street. It was a poor price before
Christmas so I have to buy yet after Christmas. There has nothing
that has claimed that we, I am a bargain. I have bought a pack of
cards for next year, I am going to booze the chemist for some make up
and then going well for a cup of tea! Dozens of people queued up
outside his branch off Next that 4:30am this morning. At this
independent record shop owners are desperate to the car sales. We will
sell some DVDs, films and music, so it is a very important thing for us
between Christmas and were a year. It will prove critical to get
customers are now, because back leg goes up next year and the British
Retail Consortium is predicting that 2011 will be tougher on the
high street than 2010. Hundreds of people turned out to support Boxing
Day hunts today. The meet is billed as one of the most important of the
year   and was held today because Boxing Day fell on a Sunday this
year. Freezing weather took its toll, with many of the drag hunts
shortened or held on foot. Fox hunting was banned five years ago,
but the tradition is proving as popular as ever, as witnessed here
at the Heethrop hunt in Chipping Norton. Everybody comes out,
everybody cheers. There is just a sense of tradition, that this has
always happened and it will always happen, come hell or high water,
and everybody loves that. Her sense of community runs through it all.
Many of us have spent recent days catching up with friends and family
but this can be a difficult time for people on their own, especially
elderly people who are less able to get out and about. That is where
charity even the South is working to extend a festive welcome to
those in need. Residents at this sheltered housing in Gosport are in
a festive mood. It's provided by Abbeyfield a not for profit 
organisation. Their mission? Alleviating loneliness amongst the
elderly. As part of the cope@christmas campaign the charity
is offering free overnight stays as well as up to 800 festive lunches
free of charge right throughout the Christmas period up until January
4th. Tom Bott is a volunteer. His job during this campaign is to
ferry people between their home and Abbeyfield. Christmas is a time
when you help other people, isn't it? If we can do this, maybe I will
need help in the future of   you never know, do you? Frances Yeoman
enjoys visiting Abbeyfield, this year her daughters are working
through Christmas. It is people like me, there has been has been
going for many years and they are all on their own, and it is nice to
have someone to talk to. There are so many people who live on the own,
who do not see anyone from one week to the next, at Christmas is a time
when Uni to be with other people, I think, so this whole idea is
excellent.    when it you need to be with other people. So if you're
over 55 and living alone, why not contact the charity, and spend the
night or an afternoon this festive season in the company of others.
Now football: Only three of the south's league teams beat
yesterday's big freeze. For Reading, it was a profitable Boxing Day.
They're now just one point outside the promotion play off places.
Steve Humphrey reports. It was a festive treat with all the
trimmings for Reading fans   as they demolished Bristol City 4 1.
Jobi McAnuff put the Royals back on level terms after they went a goal
behind. Noel Hunt gave them the lead. Then Shane Long scored two
more goals to wrap up the Boxing Day victory. I am delighted. The
names just roll off the tongue   great performances from all other
players. Also in the Championship, David Nugent kept his eye on the
ball to get Portsmouth's goal in their 1 1 draw with Millwall. And
in the only League Two match to beat the weather, Wycombe's Ben
Strevens got the winner as they beat Hereford 2 1. Aldershot's
match tomorrow at Morecambe has been called off, as has the match
between Wycombe and Chesterfield. Onto the weather now   and Reham
Khan has our forecast. For the Bank Holiday Monday sales, there was a
thaw, and that was quite cloudy of mild. We had a band of rain
overnight. Not a huge significant thing, but those outbreaks of rain
could be heavy. Doll of damp tomorrow with highs of seven
Celsius for the coast. Into the evening, mist and fog could be
quite significant. More extensive than tonight. As we head into
