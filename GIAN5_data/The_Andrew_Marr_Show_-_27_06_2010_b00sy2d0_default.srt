gather from the West, introducing England fans here and in South
Africa steel themselves for today's crucial match against Germany.
So much at stake. So much history, and this is where England will meet
Germany. The stadium in Bloemfontein. We are expecting
thousands of England fans for this mouth watering prospect.
In other news, moving house to get a job. The unemployed could be
offered incentives to relocate to places where there is more work.
Protests at the G20 summit in Canada. Barack Obama tells David
Cameron the special relationship is Is the English have a never say die
attitude and great fight and commitment, and personally I think
it is never a good sign when the other side feel they can be
generous before the game starts. Joining me today for our review of
there Sunday newspapers, Oona King, Good morning.
Thousands of England fans in South who has her sights on becoming
Africa and millions more back home are getting ready for this
mayor of London. The papers can't resist the wartime elegies for with
the football but it is not only the football. The bone dry Institute
for Fiscal Studies says that after this Budget, we are in for the
longest, deepest, sustained period of cuts for public services bending
since World War II. But it is a gamble. Vince Cable was one of the
first to one about the impact of the crisis. He is helping to
administer shock therapy. Is he sure it will work? We will find out
later. There will also rid of and about    will also be talking about
Afghanistan. 10 British soldiers died in as many days. The American
general in charge has been sacked and the Fire Minister is openly
discussing a timetable for British troops to come home. Is it more
exit than strategy? I will asks General so much of Burnet what he
makes of the latest events.    General Sir Richard Dannatt. And we
will hear from an actress and writer, Meera Syal, who proves
comedy can be universal. And we have music from the Indian sitar
player, and if go chancre. Unemployed people could be offered
incentives to move to places where there are more jobs under plans
being considered by the Government. The Work and Pensions Secretary,
Iain Duncan Smith, has told today's Sunday Telegraph that millions are
trapped in areas of high unemployment and they won't leave
because they are worried about losing their council homes. The
Labour leadership candidate, Ed Balls, says the proposal is
profoundly unfair. Police in to run to have used tear gas to control
thousands of protesters near the venue of the G20 summit of leaders
of the world's major economies. After meeting David Cameron,
President Obama stressed that special where she shivered in the
British and the US is built on rock solid foundations    special
relationship. Touching down in Toronto for some a
number two. And hitching a ride with the American President, David
Cameron, a rare foreign guest on Marine One. He has threatened to
send me a bill, but time is tight in the UK so we will have to take
it as a free left! Both of them keen to drive home the point that
weather in Afghanistan are the economy, there is no gap. Their
relationship is rock solid. And how the fragile global recovery is most
is now centre stage, a broader discussion expanded to include
Asian giants like India and Korea in the larger G20 gathering.
Outside the summit venue, a large protest march brought traffic to a
halt. The mostly peaceful rally was overshadowed by clashes, masked
demonstrators seemed to be looking for trouble. Rows of heavily armed
riot police met them with truncheons. At his two police cars
were set ablaze, and unsettling moment of violence. The heavily 
armed summit has prompted the question, what is the point of it?
Go to all 20 nations represented to agree is proving difficult,
especially when it is the more developed countries whose economies
are in most trouble. Let us get beyond the first world, Third World
rhetoric. We are all connected, and we have to look at the effect on
one another and that is why it is good we have a G20. You have a
different group of countries. Finding policies they can all agree
on is today's challenge. A British soldier who was wounded
in Afghanistan has died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
Birmingham. The servicemen, from the 4th Regiment Royal Artillery,
was hit by an explosion a fortnight ago. It takes the total number of
UK personnel killed in the country since 2001 308.
Thousands of fans in South Africa and millions back home are getting
ready for this afternoon's World Cup match against Germany. About
15,000 supporters have arrived in the City of Bloemfontein Goa where
security remains tight and British and German police will patrol
together. Fabio Capello's men didn't start the tournament well
but they have improved and a victory against their old rivals
would see them through to the quarter finals. And up to 30
million people are expected to tune into the match across the UK.
Kylie Minogue made her debut at Glastonbury last night, five years
after she was forced to pull out of the festival having been diagnosed
with breast cancer. She joined the Scissor Sisters on the main Pyramid
Stage for performance of their song, Any Which Way.
That is all from me. I will be back just before 10 am with the
headlines. Now, to the front pages, football,
football, football. The news of the wild is a slightly unsettling.   
News of the World. The people have found a witch doctor to curse the
German team, a little unfriendly. And other papers, other stories.
The Observer supporting    support for Clegg. Banning selling eggs by
the dozen. Scotland on Sunday for the Independent's referendum, the
Sunday Times slightly strained Headline, women to get childbirth
deadline. Nine months being the traditional one. The Sunday
Telegraph, get on your bike. An interesting story about Hyde   
have butterflies can get around the place in the Telegraph. The control
for hundreds of miles because of tiny molecules in their brains.
Where are they going? Glastonbury, mostly. Clive Anderson here. Thank
you for coming it. And football, I guess? Yes. A lot of football
headlines. But this is the whole story that is wrong for favours.
The English if they had won their group. Instead there is a phoney
war before the game. Nobody knows who will wind. I don't think they
have done well. The uproar his attempt by the News of the World.
And they have a desperate headline on the back trying to get something
out of Wayne Rooney's name. And this headline, I think it is what
we are supposed to be sane, the English, we will make him Surrey,
saying to Germany. But it sounds like what Germany is saying to
England! They are all struggling to build up a head of steam. And it is
presumably    presumably not in the Scottish interest. One paper
suggests it is going to be won by Holland, which is in Scotland on
Sunday, surprise surprise! Germany has a word for a team that does
well and polymers but is not good. And another word for a team that is
good but manages to disappoint. And I thought we had the definition of
football in England, a game of two Haase and 11 men running around for
each to him, and then the Germans went. I think we are all being
prepared for the fact... It is building we are going to win but
repent for losing. And we quite like the Germans and it will be all
right. There are only two things the delight of about, football and
the weather. It is amazing that we quite often get both wrong, don't
we? In terms of the football, and I must say the only time I have
fallen to my knees in recent history was two days ago when my
campaign team said I could watch the third bowl this afternoon
because they had rearranged a campaign    the football. Why?
is amazing how many people want to have campaign meetings during third
bowl!    during football. Many people don't care, and they are
probably thinking how sad we are. But the Sun, not the newspaper, why
is it people do not get that thing about suntan lotion, protection? I
have a black father and a white mother. And because my mother is
luminescent the White, and English, I know that I have to put sunscreen
on. Many people have been taken for treatment. Why have we not clocked?
It is a surprise factor. Every time we do less well in the football and
we get sunburnt! Yes. And Glastonbury takes everybody by
surprise. You have to take bits and it is muddy, and suddenly you
cannot cope because it is sunny    have to take Wellington boots.
Another story. My point about football is that it shows that told
was born is a brilliant tactician. He has brought his Budget out this
week when nobody is talking about things like... Well, try not to.
The Independent on Sunday has quite a lot of stuff on the budget and
how bad it is. What went wrong? Wrong, wrong, wrong is the headline.
Joseph sticks explains at some length why this Budget is a
disaster. It will bring Britain and probably the whole world down. It
is on page 47 or 48. In the same paper, they have got Lib Dem rebels
and secret talks with Labour to block the budget. If this is true,
that there is a split in the coalition, this is a big story
potentially. But it is buried there, with all due respect to the
Independent on Sunday, because we have so much sport to think about.
There is so much sport to talk about. And the weather! Yes, and if
Andy Murray wins Wimbledon, they will sneak Batten and England
beating Australia at the cricket as well    sneak back in. It ties in
with the support for Clegg's slumps of the U turn for VAT. The Lib Dems
are struggling with the claims of betrayal that have been shrieked
all around the country. It is interesting as to how they will
deal with that. I'm sure Vince Cable will have something to say
about that in a minute. When you campaign on one policy people vote
for you and then you'd have the exact opposite policy. Labour would
never do anything like that, with they? Can you imagine it? They are
down to 16 in the opinion polls. Yes. The IFS has shown this Budget
will be six times worse for the poorest people in Britain. So how
do Lib Dem backbenchers get around that fact? Explain to us about this
headline that I was mucking earlier on. Women to get childbirth
deadline. Not to be gender stereotypical, I think I missed
mine. I had to adopt both my children. What it is a doctor
saying that they have invented a test which will tell women when
they can no longer have kids. So for what some women that is 25, for
some it is 55. The campaign, have I met my tax code    deadline, have I
created my family in time? It is more precise and individualised.
Yes, apparently to a matter of months. When you are 20 you could
know that when you are 31 and six months, that is it, it is finished.
That will have a dramatic effect a relationships. Do men have a
deadline as well? No, you go on forever. What is the next thing we
will look at? Afghanistan. There was a military day yesterday. A
policy to make people more aware of what is going on. We are fighting
this war. People mock me, I have made this point before. The war if
at    in an affair has done has lasted more than the Second World
War.    in Afghanistan. World record deaths. While that has been
going you have this extraordinary thing of McCrystal in America being
brought down by Rolling Stone magazine.    Stanley McChrystal.
People who founded it will be having themselves, thinking that
Rolling Stone has been through a variety of different forms but now
it is sufficiently influential that they can follow around the top
American in Afghanistan. I thought, surely President Obama could laugh
off a few remarks? But apparently it is more complicated than that.
It is not so much to push other jump. He was very rude about the
You do not sacked generals when they are winning wars. You would
have thought a few remarks would not have mattered. It is about a
politician having to say, I and top dog and my poll ratings are
problematic. The serious point that comes out is when David Cameron is
talking about exit times. He mentioned it is more exit than
strategy. If you are sticking to timetables, you're not thinking
about what is happening on the ground. You have a story about the
Milibands. Haverstock Comprehensive School is the Eton of the Labour
Party. It must be having a head put down the toilet. David was above me,
Ed was baloney in years. Not that tall.    below me in years. Not at
all. David Miliband said his worst gaffe was not eating the banana
before I was photographed with it. It made me think how those little
tiny things, quite often it is not the bigger things you would imagine.
It is, did I eat a banana before I walked out the door? You mentioned
sport. A lot of people will be thinking about Andy Murray over
this weekend. He is not our most charismatic sports player. He is
still in with a chance. He is in the second week. He bowed to the
Queen. He has sailed through so far. Is this the year that the English
are going to learn to love Andy Murray? When he wins, he is British.
When he loses, he is eight so Lee Scott. He is a proud Briton when he
wins.    surly Scot.. The problem is that there are not 20 other
players at a given time. One stumble and one pulled muscle and
hopes are dashed. You Arnaud one of two Labour candidates left in the
race to be the London mayoral candidate. You and Ken Livingstone.
You are up against a very widely experienced and, in the past,
successful player. Is that a mildly intimidating thought? I am looking
to the future. I was a 14 year old when Ken Livingstone was running
the GLC. I am in my forties now. I just make the point that there is a
time when you do look towards the future. I want to be Mayor of
London because, although London is a fantastic city, I live here, I
grew up here and love London, it is not the fairest city. I would like
to make its fair. The type of city where parents would want to bring
their kids up. You do think, would it be better to move out of London?
If we can make it fairer and more equal, it would be a fantastic
place to live. How would you do that?
Not the Government. You would be only the match of London. If you
take transport, nearly twice as many people live in outer London as
in a London. They cannot get home at night. The investment choices we
make our skewed. I would like to see regular bus services and more
staff for outer London stations rather than concentration on Inner
London. I would like to see school buses. That would bring down
congestion. It would help parents and people who do not have kids but
get irritated when they cannot get on the bus. In terms of the economy,
there is a living wage we could have. You said the mayor does not
have powers, strictly speaking you are right. He has huge influence.
The living wage is important. It is extraordinary that you can work in
London and barely have enough money to get there cheaper home. That has
to be changed. The other policy I would flag is housing. You can make
that immensely pharaoh without spending huge amounts. You must be
worried that Lembit Opik is saying he might be standing. You have got
Lembit Opik, Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone against two. These
mayoral contests can often provide more vivid plaque    clashes than
other politics. That is a nice word to use. Thank you both. And I
should say that we expect to talk to Ken Livingstone next month and
hear why he hopes he will get a chance to represent Labour at the
next election for Mayor of London. Now we have had a glorious few days,
weather wise, almost, very nearly, too hot at Glastonbury. But is the
mini heatwave going to continue? Let's find out from Laura Tobin in
It looks set to stay pretty warm. We are expecting quite high UV
levels. Suncream at hand. High grass pollen levels. This is the
glorious satellite picture. Speckled cloud 3 Scotland and
Northern Ireland. We are going to see some showers around. In between
there will be some sunshine, temperatures creeping into the low
twenties. Some of the shires will become heavy during the day. South
through England and on into Wales it is a try, beautiful and sunny
afternoon to come. Top temperatures could climb up to 31 Celsius in
London. The heat will gather in land. Around the coast, on the
seaside, it is cooler and fresher and more comfortable. The blues
skies will continue across Wales as well. Tomorrow there will be more
cloud around pushing in from the west. Further showers in Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Still holding on to the warmth in London. We
cannot be there for another five years. The Prime Minister's words,
on the mission in Afghanistan. That sounds like the beginning of a
timetable. So what will be the impact of David Cameron's comments,
on the troops serving in Afghanistan and on the Taleban,
whose insurgency continues? General Sir Richard Dannatt was until last
year the head of the Army, and he It is looking sunny in your garden.
Thank you for joining us. Do you agree we cannot be there for
another five years? He has made that comment. He has made other
comments about the overall mission which are important with regard to
time. On his last visit he said, we do not want to be there one day
longer and with one soldier more than we need before we achieve the
aim. This notion of five years is important. It is a long length of
time. That time element is important. It is important that we
resourced properly and put the maximum amount of effort in as a
coalition and an alliance to make sure we succeed and do that as
quickly as possible. That is in the interests of Afghanistan and the
armed forces as well. The real problem is set any hint of the
timetable encourages the Taliban to think that they can hang on, wait
there and then come back in due course when we leave. That is why,
from now on, and we have been doing it for the last little while, we
must put maximum pressure on to succeed. The Taliban do not have
that kind of option. I think what has to be remembered is these
complex and difficult counter  insurgency campaigns always take
time. There is the notion of strategic patients. Think back to
Northern Ireland. We were there for 38 years. In Bosnia we were there
for 15 years. In Kosovo, it was 10 years. It was right to say we have
been in Afghanistan since 2001. This major operation began in 2006.
This major push is critical that we get right. It has been running for
four years. We need to put maximum effort in now. We must achieve our
aim. It has made Afghanistan secure enough for themselves and our
purposes. It has stopped being an     a failed state. That is where the
effort has to go at the moment. does seem to me that you think the
five year, it was unhelpful. Once you put any time limit on it, you
have conceded something. I am not going to say that. I do not think
it is relevant. There are many factors. What we have to do is make
sure that support for this mission has heavyweight political support
in Washington and London. NATO is very much behind the mission. The
UK and the US resorts this. They need to get behind this in it a
practical sense. We need to make sure this mission six seats. There
is a quote this morning saying there is a widespread perception in
Afghanistan that nature is not winning this. A lot of people
accept the NATO campaign will fail. They do not think that NATO was see
it through. The Government is not strong enough to continue. They
expect a another round of civil war and of getting ready for that.
Michael some port is a respected person and he has a point of view.
It is difficult and it is taking time but progress is being made on
a gradual basis. One factor that is important is the popular
understanding of the mission. If we keep talking about negative things,
such as casualties, however tragic they might be, we will only be
pulling the mission down. It is important we focus on some of the
things that are doing well. Do you think there is enough explanation
of that? We do hear constantly about the death. It has been a
terrible few days for the British Army again. We hear about a certain
amount of ground being captured and then it goes away. A lot of people
are not at all clear what is being achieved. I am sorry. We have lost
the link. Can you hear me? I can hear you. I lost your last question
and your last comment. I was wondering what was going on in
Afghanistan and if it was clear enough. There is an unpopular
government. A bit of ground is won and then it gets lost again.
Nothing seems to change radically. I think that perception is wrong.
We need to get some less interesting stories of wider
coverage. There is an understandable operational design
to clear areas of Taliban which we are doing and holding them securely
so that people can feel confident and building a better life for them
so they can choose to help their own government and not fall back
under the Taliban again. That is happening and it will take time.
The US surge will not be complete until November this year. The
numbers are still building up. We must not forget we are putting a
lot of effort into building at the Afghan security forces as well.
130,000 have been trained. That is increasing on a daily basis. That
is important. We will get to the crossover and our own troops can
start reducing and start to come home. Whether that is in three,
five or seven years, it is difficult to tell. Conditions on
the ground are important. Time is an important element. We have to
focus on the progress as well. does strike me that President de
dam might not have fired General Stanley McChrystal had things been
going better.    President Obama. You have experience of the
difficulties of being a top soldier from your own experience. What did
General Stanley McChrystal do wrong? He did write in so far as
analysing the situation he found a year ago, designing and operational
Strategy, focusing the forces and starting to achieve success.
Unfortunately, what he did was make colleagues about the US leadership,
the president, the ambassador and others, which gave President Obama
no option but to dismiss him. It is a personal tragedy for General
Stanley McChrystal Ando do not think it is a strategic disaster
for Afghanistan. General Petraeus is in the wings and he is an
excellent soldier. Losing General Stanley McChrystal is unhelpful but
not a strategic disaster. I think David Petraeus will keep it on a
good track. I had a lot of confidence in him. Jock stirrup
took friendly fire from politicians and newspapers last weekend. There
is a big choice about who will replace him. Is it important to get
an Army man? Do you think the inevitable review of the armed
forces should be concentrating on expensive fighters and large ships
and so on and asking whether they are necessary against spending more
This is a matter for the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister
to decide who is most competent, and in who they have most compers
to lead our armed forces    confidence. As far as the defence
review is concerned, a couple of things. There is a growing
consensus we should do these things regularly, every four or five years,
and that is important. If we have to make difficult decisions that
might favour an increase spending on our land forces for the period
of time we are in Afghanistan, that is probably the right thing to do
now but it might mean that if we are going to review our defence in
four years time we will be able to shift our spending priorities. We
have to focus on the here and now, what is really important, and I
think that means they should be a marginal, not huge, but the
marginal increase in the funding for our land forces. The Royal
Marines, those things we need to ensure success in Afghanistan. If
we are going to take risks, we    it should be on the medium to long 
term requirements for the unexpected. It is always hard to
predict the unexpected but let us make sure we resource that probably
for the next five seven years. Thank you for joining us. Meera
Syal must be one of the most dauntingly creative and busy actors
and writers in Britain. She devised, wrote and starred in Goodness
Gracious Me and The Kumars at Number 42. She has written novels
and screenplays, appeared in Dr Who and Holby City. And she is a jazz
cellar. She'll be back on stage in the West End to play Shirley
Valentine. She came into the studio earlier and I asked why fare had
struck such a chord.    y The Kumars at Number 42 has struck a
chord. It is about families and we'll have one of those. If a
famous person wanted to an Indian household, there would be no
fawning, the father would say, are you married yet? How much do you
earn? And the mother would try to feed them up. The warmth of the
format made it work in lots of countries. It cannot be an Indian
family in all of these countries. They have chosen their own versions.
Yes, that is fascinating. They are looking at minority groups in each
country. I think in France it was an Algerian family. In the States
it was a Mexican family. Only Israel bought it, but we were
waiting for the Palestinians and number 42 and it never happened!
That would have been great. Shirley Valentine is back on the West End
stage. With you. I know! You are the centre of collector. What
people don't know is the original Willy Russell play is a monologue.
It is just you on stage, which is one heck of a thing to sustain, I
would guess. Beautifully written play, but for long time to be there
by yourself. It is. It is two hours. And you are right, it was always
written as a one woman show. It was written in 1986, I think. Pauline
Collins did it. She did in the West End. And Norman Kershaw was their
actual very first one. Willy Russell waited because he had been
to see Billy Connolly and said I want to write something with the
flavour of Billy Connolly, but for a woman. As so you have this
housewife who has lost herself. It happens to many people, not just
women. You are a wife and mother but you have forgotten who you are.
It is about unused life. It is a very humanist play. Men resonate
with it as much as women do. say it was 1986. Have you had to
move it any sense in tone? At the time, I remember when the film came
out it felt like a film of its time. Yes. Willy Russell took the
decision and the director took it to keep it in the 80s but not
specific. The kitchen fittings and the clothes are not to the 80s. But
because it is a universal, beautifully written play, you do
not need to mess with it too much because it works. When you are
asking where somebody's comic talent comes from, what the Ritz
are, you mentioned earlier on family. Everybody has got family.
Was it like that for you? Was it originally from your family, the
tensions and inside the family? would say that has a lot to do with
it. My mum and dad have a great sense of humour and the house was
always full of Punjabi families. Punjabis are like the copies of
India. We like a laugh and joke.    Kok niece of India. I remember
music going on, very burble. And Victorians, there used to have   
like the Victorians, we used to have sing song evenings so you were
encouraged to be a performer. And it became competitive. My party 
piece was singing Paper Roses policy tar. We shun now going to
perform for us.    honesty tar. Is it wild times for family like
yours? It is the background. Yes. We were in the West Midlands and
the Enoch Powell influence was keen. I remember the atmosphere of unease
and fear that it evoked, his work. We used to have the suitcases and
of the wardrobe, just sitting there, and I always thought it was because
we had to run quickly encased in a Powell became Prime Minister. It
was only when I did Goodness Gracious Me that I realised that
all the other Indian families had two cases on top of the wardrobe.
Do you think it is the grounding power of the comedy that to do as a
response to that? Let us bring people together. I totally think
that. One of the joys of doing Goodness Gracious Me, and actually
Shirley Valentine as well, that humour is such a huge a
humanitarian healing process if you get it right. I really felt
Goodness Gracious Me probe done a lot of prejudice and barriers.
thing we have in common is Dr Who. They have been a lot of people who
have been on Dr Who as a bit part, saying, you get all the sort of
stuff from the fans, and it is a bit of a plane. But it is the thing
you always wanted to do. Is that true? Yes. From the minute the
franchise came back with kick good    Chris Eccleston I was knocking
on the door. I went through    it went through David Tennant, and no
phone calls, but in the end, I did. Tummy about the character. For the
City people who missed it.    tell me. Uploaded geologist who was
travelling to the centre of the Earth and unearthed something nasty.
A bit like BP? I know! It was before that. I got to go to the

Tardis, get chased by aliens, runaway being shut up, I did all of
that. It was great. Good luck with all of that. Shirley Valentine

had the full orchestra perpetually in the background.    life would be
more interested. Last week's emergency Budget was a
defining moment for the coalition Government, mapping out five years
of unprecedented austerity and tax increases. The Kinlochshiel budget,
it was quickly but    dubbed.    kill or cure up budget it was
dubbed. And joined by the Business Secretary, Vince Cable. Welcome.
You were a warning not long ago on this showed that there was a danger
of a double dip recession if exactly this kind of medicine was
applied, now you are applying it. Indeed a warned of the risk, and
there are risks. But there are risks in both directions. If you
move too quickly and half the there is a danger of precipitating the
slowdown and the problems. But if we did nothing there is a danger of
being caught up in the fast stop, loss of confidence in the country,
higher interest rates.    fast storm. The latter risk was the
bigger one and we had to act. you get the balance wrong, if data
starts to come in saying the economy is contracting, and
unemployment is rising faster than you expected, is there any kind of
mechanism or way of changing course? The mechanism for keeping
the economy moving forward and maintaining demand is monetary
policy. In the political dramas around policy in recent years it
has been forgotten that under the Labour Government there was a very,
very tiny fiscal stimulus. Most of the work was done by low interest
rates, monetary its branch and    expansion. And it was for the Bank
of England to step in? Yes. And the Governor of the Bank of England
made it clear he wanted to see the budget and is pleased we got it. We
hope realistically that monetary policy will take up the slack it
means to be taken up. It was described by George Osborne as her
progressive budget but was not. The IFS figures and the rest of it made
it clear that the people at the bottom of the heap lose
proportionately more. I think they are two things. There were measures
and then there is the aggregate effect. If you look at specific
measures there are specific progressive steps which my party
had fought for. There was lifting the tax threshold, something we had
fought for years, the capital gains tax reform. The public sector pay
policy that helps people at the bottom end. Revolutionary changes,
Protection Against Child poverty. They were very big steps which
would not have been taken if there had not been a coalition. They are
important steps. But overall effect is regressive because if you put in
the effect of VAT at 20 % on the numbers, then lower income and
lower middle income families get it much harder than high income
families. You talked about it being a car park and a regressive tax,
raising VAT. That is the problem. You said it was a regressive tax.
In some respects it is. But the higher fares said it is slightly
progressive. If you look at the way in which people spend their money,
lower income families have exemptions, of course, because food
does not get VAT on it, nor does the public transport or rent. They
describe    they describe it a slightly progressive. If you look
up the overall impact, if you look at the measures the be carried
forward from the last Government's, some of which are totally sensible
but that we decided to implement, things we carried through that we
did not have to, if you look at the package as a whole that makes the
balance better and more equitable. And yet we see and again your
party's Tory tax bombshell, quoted in the papers. You're right to
raise this. What I said repeatedly, and we had chances debates   
Chancellors debate, where we said that could not be ruled out. All
three parties used the same line. And as a party you went heavily on
accusing the Conservatives of doing it. D and not stand in front of the
poster because you were worried about it    do you not? I don't
think it did actually. Why didn't you stand in front of it? We were
scoring a point against the Conservatives. That was an election.
We have now moved past the elections and we are working with
the Conservatives. We have The poll we are quoting was backed
by researchers of Ed Miliband. We have the five year Parliament. The
vast majority of the public is with us. They do understand we have
horrendous problems in this country which we have inherited. There is a
massive deficit. We have to do it. Some of the things are unpopular.
The majority of the public is attracted by the idea of two
parties working together to sort out the mess. If it were possible
to amend an aspect of the budget and make it fairer, we do support
that happening on the floor of the House of Commons? We have balanced
packages. Which you put down motions to try to effect things at
the age of the Budget? Simon Hughes is not going to put down amendments
and changes to the Budget. That is clear. He was taken out of context
to what he said. It is a balanced package. We will be supporting the
budget. The Liberal Democrats are behind the action. We have to. The
country demands we tackle this enormous problem that we inherited.
We are working together to solve it. We have both have to make
compromises. What about welfare? On the Conservative side of the
coalition it has been said that if the welfare cuts can be deeper, you
can save a bit more on the public spending and tax side? That has
worried a lot of people on the other side of politics. If the
welfare reforms turned out to be deeper and, in a sense, harsher
than we have been told now, is that something that Liberal Democrats
inside the coalition can stop? There is an argument that will rage
over the next few months in government about whether cuts
actually fall. The last government has said there will be 40 billion
of cuts, including incredibly deep cuts in some departments. They were
talking about 20% to 25% cuts in unprotected departments. We are
trying to explain how this will be down. It is a practical task of
delivering severe cuts in public spending. The country is poorer. We
cannot afford this. There is a balance to be struck between
welfare measures and cuts in departmental budgets and we must
argue that threw in the next few months. I am concerned as a
Department of Education that as George Osborne said in the Budget
education is respected. It has to be weighed against difficult
decisions that might have to be taken on the welfare side. What
about the immigration cap which has been announced? Are you not
concerned it will keep out potential high flyers and people at
different levels that the British economy needs to expand. There is
no suggestion it will do that. We have to strike a balance. There is
a political commitment to maintain a cap on non EU immigration. It has
to be done in a flexible way. There has to be an interim measure up to
cover the rest of this year. If you announce the year in advance that
you will introduce a cap, there is a danger you get a flood of people
coming in to beat it. This has happened in the past. The process
of operating this immigration cap will be subject to consultation.
The business groups will make the point, which I fully support, that
if you have a growing economy, you have to draw people in from all
over the world with unique contributions. We have a university
situation that relies on students and they are very welcome. A There
is an argument in newspapers in the cabinet about ministers being
cautious about the Kack side of the argument. How did that discussion
make you feel about the way this coalition will work? Did you think
you have disagreements but you can work them out what did you think it
will be difficult? There are two objectives to be achieved. One is
to reassure the public there is effective immigration control,
which is the purpose of the cap. The other is to make sure the
economy recovers. We have to balance that. You have got movement
as a result of that. All the discussion we have had so far is
expose sides of that argument. I am confident that the way it is being
implemented will achieve both those objectives. You have some movement.
The key point is that we have consultation to come. We will be
consulting with the universities and businesses. On your banking
proposals. If you cannot get international agreement on
restructuring the banks and on the question of bonuses, do you still
go ahead? A whole set of things have to be done with the banks. The
banking crisis caused this terrible mess we have been inheriting. Big
steps need to be taken. Chancellor said the Labour Party
caused this terrible... The Labour government allowed the banking
sector to dominate the British economy in an unhealthy way, almost
Icelandic levels of. We are where we are and we have to sort the mess
out. We have to set up the banking levy and set up a commission to
look into breaking up the banks and make the more stable and more
competitive. Are you in charge of that? We have jointly overseeing
the operation. We are going to get the good outcome in terms of
looking at what is a very complex problem. There is more difficulty
ahead for the banks and more cake     painted Cam. There are issues
about how banks lend. They have inherited the Commons on the G20
discussion. There were international proposals which would
have made it more difficult for banks to lend. Those things have to
be addressed. It is about whether they are doing enough. The
Chancellor and I will be discussing this with the banks in the coming
weeks. The Americans are worried that European economies are going
for retrenchment and clamping down and there is a danger of the world
recovery stalling and halting. They are right to be worried, aren't
they? There are serious worries if every country in the world does the
same thing. It slows down gross. The world economy is heavily
unbalanced. The rub countries like China which have surplus savings.  
  there are countries. The Chinese are being helpful. Germany could be
doing a lot more to rebalance the European economy. Britain has 2% of
world GDP. We are not in a position of telling the world what to do. We
are very vulnerable and need to act. Another policy area is the Post
Office part privatisation. Labour pushed this to one side. Are you
going to go ahead with it? We are. in this Parliament that will go
ahead. You may remember I argued for this in the Liberal Democrats
five years ago. It was something that had to be down. There are
several sets of problems. There is the enormous pension deficit. The
Royal Mail is consistently losing business. The only practical
solution is to bring in private capital which we want to combine
with worker shareholding. We have just heard the Unite union has
postponed their British Airways strike ballot. That is a bit of
good news. Talk us through that dispute just at the moment. How
important is it to get a quick resolution? That does seem very
good news. It is long overdue. The strikes are doing enormous damage
to the reputation of the company and the country. We need to get it
result and get it resolve quickly. I am delighted that step has been
confirmed. Now over to Louise for the news headlines. Unemployed
people could be offered incentives to move to places where there are
more jobs under plans being considered by the Government. Work
and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith tells today's Sunday
Telegraph that millions are trapped in areas of high unemployment and
they will not leave because they are worried about losing their
council homes. The Labour leadership candidate, Ed Balls,
says the proposal is profoundly unfair. Thousands of England fans
in South Africa and millions more back home are getting ready for
this afternoon's World Cup match against Germany. About 15,000
supporters have arrived in the city of Bloemfontein, where security
remains tight and British and German police will patrol together.
Fabio Capello's men did not start the tournament well but have
improved. And a victory against their old rivals would see them
through to the quarter finals. The next news on BBC1 is at 11 o'clock.
Back to Andrew and guests in a moment. First, a brief look at
what's coming up straight after this programme. We are in
Birmingham where, last night, the 300 and the eighth British soldier
died from injuries sustained in Helmand province.    300 and eighth.

Shankar. She is the daughter of the legendary sitar player, Ravi
Shankar, and a highly accomplished sitar player in her own right, as
we will see in a moment. But first, Anoushka, tell us about the
instrument. It is enormous and very heavy. It looks uncomfortable to
play. When you are used to it it is not uncomfortable. It is very
challenging to learn to play. The way we sipped his support the
instrument can be quite uncomfortable for someone who is
used to it. For a lot of people who do not understand about it, they
remember the Beatles and George Harrison and so on. There is a
slight sort of, it is very strict. It takes years and years of
training. It is of one of the most commonly recognised instruments
other than classical music. It is incredibly fast and intricate and
complicated to learn. It takes a lifetime to master. George Harrison
was a particular admirer, almost like a surrogate son of your father.
I wonder if oval, but whole Beatles period was good or bad for Indian
classical music? It put classical music in a box it might not have
wanted to be in. It was challenging for my father to be faced with rock
star status when what he wanted to do was to be a classical musician.
He wanted to promote his music. It was a wonderful thing. When do fad
and insanity ended, what remained was a huge amount of genuine lovers
