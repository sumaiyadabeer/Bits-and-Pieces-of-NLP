to play some sort of carry on. I don't think you can run through  
it looks like he is playing the run through so that tells me e that
two reds did pot. Saying that, I don't know if he's on anything. He
wouldn't have been playing for the the black before when he ran into
the red. Anyway, you just roll the blue, you would have thought, leave
yourself a mid distant red. He' got a little bit of work to do with the
cue ball here. Why doesn't he play the straight
one? He didn't need to. He hit that to perfection. You couldn't wish
the one just below the pink. I can't believe he would play for
red and a colour and he will have red. That is exactly right.
Couldn't have played it any better just 67 remaining.
Very well played, indeed.
He had a chance   a long red. He missed that. I was going to say
maybe we will see a century, but Dominic has taken the first round.
he will need one snooker to    remaining in red, he will need one
snooker to tie. Anything but a black and he will need two snookers.
He's done the maths, as you know.
Ideally he would like to leave the red next to the pink. That is
probably the last red he will leave on. Two more reds and blacks. Were
you always an advocate on leaving the red? I think if you only need
one snooker, but in this case it is a snooker to tie. I would leave it
on just because you may get...
If you only needed one snooker, I see no reason trying to get a good
position on the other side of the yellow and trying to push the
yellow up the table, get a snooker behind the brown. He's played a
lovely shot there. He doesn't have to take the easy route. He is
taking the awkward one which he kissed out. You are kidding me.
played it in the other pocket. (LAUGHS)
. Concentrate. Pay attention! would have been happy with that on
a big break, wouldn't you? Of course now, the snooker is going to
be late. That was an outrageous fluke. Disappointed he didn't cover
the righthand side cushion.
You would expect Dominic to miss this. He's got to be careful if he
plays it with any sort of pace he doesn't leave a free ball. If he
should miss it. If he misses this, then he will be able to tie. He is
just thinking here whether he plays it hard or soft. Just make certain

Dominic can't really play any positive shots, so he keeps leaving
again, but there is another gap. is amazing, isn't it? He played two
good shots and he is just a fraction away from getting the
snooker. Dominic may be taking this on. That is how much of the red he
The black or the white... He's got shot, even though the red is more
or less in the middle of the table, there is plenty of room to go
around it, but there is a one  cushion escape. Players at this
several, this standard, you wouldn't expect them to miss a
snooker. They are only coming off black and all. It goes to a respot.
The red is cut. How does he get on the black? I don't think he can.
I thought for one minute he was going to get the snooker there. He
played a pot and missed it by the the red unless he can get a
position on the black otherwise he will need snookers, but there may
be a chance here again he could snooker and then he could force his

ruined around the back of it. As it is, it is quite a big target for
Dominic. Not a straightforward hit this, though.
Left hand side cushion, right hand side cushion. There is a gap
between the yellow and pink   this would make it a lot easier to get
out of. He is swerving it. So you then it would be risky. A good hit.
Once again, no angle on the red to
get on the black so Matthew will probably refuse it. If he tries it
half ball and tries to get the white off the black position and
get the pink and yellow. I am not shower if he can play that shot
from this angle, but he certainly There is a possibility he could
play the red off the black no the left hand corner. I think it is
worth a go because he can still get that cue ball up behind the yellow
and pink. Looks like he's changed his mind. I thought he could do it
from this side. He could put the black    you've got the chance of
putting the black out of commission if you played it. Yes. As I say, he
was always sending that cue ball back towards the yellow and pink,
but a little bit pacey. Now, decision time for Matthew.
Absolutely. Very sinister, first ready play at the other end of the
table, John, when he rolled it in, it may have rolled off. This is
another one if he is going to play it, he has to roll it slow. Whether
or not he plays the pot or not. We will know in a couple of seconds.
He's gone all out for it. It is a fabulous pot. Well done.
He's in for a tie. Yes, and I think
  well, I know the yellow passes the pink. I think the groan just
passes the brown.    green just passes the brown. What a chance
this is. He couldn't play for the yellow in the conventional pocket.
He is playing this yellow now. You have just got to be wary he doesn't
have an intentional cannon on the pink. He definitely passes the
brown. OK. He may have got that up, but he
will be very disappointed he's missed the frame. Well, a chance to
get a re spotted black there. He might get a better chance. He e
could be snookered here if Dominic plays this right. The bad news is
he's played a bad shot. The good news is the brown is safe. He
possibly might get another chance in this frame before the respot
comes. It was a strange choice of shot. You can't really pot the
yellow and hold it low enough on the greens and leave the green to
kiss the browns out. He may have to play that up and down. You would
love to roll it on dead weight and leave it on the angle on the green.
It looks a little bit thin to me. he? He tried to play it as slow as
he could to give himself a chance. and playing the double on the brown.
Surely roll the green and try to get a snooker from brown behind the
black. It keeps him in control of the situation. Well, he has made
the angle.
It is amazing how you can manoeuvre the cue ball almost straight and
you can move it sideways. Does this drop in the middle? It looks as
though it will.
would probably run safe and that is what has happened. Dominic trying
to get in the pink here. He's played it nicely. The key thing
there was the object ball. The cue ball wasn't so important that time,
but the object ball was. He's got plays it up and down, the brown is
almost certain to kiss the blue. He's got to be careful where the
white will end up. This has been made a not too difficult pot. It is
frame ball. It looked like it was go dog be a
lot quicker than that.
   Going to be a lot quicker than that.
This looks like it has clinched it
for Dominic. 26 points the lead. So even though he is not feeling
too good, in all honesty, he doesn't look too good either.

If it is coming out, it is probably a bit like a browse. If it is

He cueed it beautifully. mentioned how nice it is to see
Matthew play beautifully again. When he does, he strikes the ball
well and gets through it all. His breaks are very good. Paul Hunter

we always knew they were going to be good players.
good, all round player and sets a very high around the. I don't think
he is frighened to win, though, John, is he? You get a lot of
players who are great players, but when it comes to the winning post,
they don't want to go by. Matthew is not one of those. No, no, he's
been a winner from his very early days. He just missed the cannon
there. He's got a choice of the centre, but just a little bit
awkward. practice do things you can't
compare it with play. He would just play the red along the top,
wouldn't he? Not even thought about it. In these tables, in these big
competitions, you always feel they are a risky shot to play and you
only play them if you have to. He is not good on this red. He is
worried about the pink, John, isn't he? He is going to play the cannon
and hoping he will push the pink off the cushion, I think. That is a
very clever shot. A very clever not perfect on either red.
This is what you have to do sometimes. You don't always play
for just one red. You have to give yourself options. This time he's
got no choice but to play for one red unless he goes into the pack.
They will only play for the loose when you are down. Just a bit
thinking about where the cue ball was going to finish, he forgot the
pot. How many times do we see that? And what a result he'd had. What a
result. Once you have missed it, you deserve to leave something on
when you are going into the reds. He hasn't done that. That was a red
trying to blow the ball in and have a fly away there. A nice easy
contin Jennifer Aniston now because once he missed, as you say, Willie,
he was very lucky not to leave anything. It cost him nothing.    A
nice easy contingency as you say, Willie, he was very lucky together
to leave anything. It cost him nothing.
The fact that the black is tied up won't really bother him. The little
cluster of three, when he pots the one just above the black   so a
good chance to win the frame with this visit.

The desired kiss. Sure Dominic will remain   it comes
to a stand. He has nodded at the referee. Matthew Stevens has
levelled at 1 all. interval. So this is the third one
that Dominic Dale gets under way. He's left the proverbial long red
which he knocks in, bound to be on anything here. Maybe the one red
behind the black. He might be able to get through to the one in the
middle. It is a lot tougher, but it but how does he get it safe? He is
looking to rest in the pack, but I can't see a position where he could
rest in the pack but independent leave a ready on the side of the
pack. Well, in that case it is the two cautions with pace. But you
have got to catch this just right. It looks a natural shot, just
passed the middle pocket on the left. There is a red beside the
pink or the red just above the pink. Even if he managed to cast the
pinks in, he would still get another chance because it would be
called a miss. I think it is very dangerous. What was he trying to
rest on that red just above the pink. Is he hard enough? He is.
he? He's been hard enough to nestle on the red just above the pink, but
not the one just below the pink. No hesitation from Matthew. He is
probably just stretching his legs just to come around. There is no
way he wasn't going to have that put back. There is a slight chance
he could have had a look at the pack. Dominic has decided to play
the same way. The thing is when you hit them a bit harder, the angle
comes off wider. Let's see if he hits it off to the left this time.
He's played it excellent this time. Well played. That's excellent,
assume he is considering playing the thin cut and considering
popping this red. If it was a safety he wouldn't give it this
much care and attention.
He just Nicked it in. He didn't know how he was going to keep it
safe escaping from the snooker and was. A choice of reds there. One
either side of the black. If he is not hampered, but he must be with
his body language, you would like to stun this in and pop the black
in the same pocket, but that makes to get in the pack. He can hold
he wants. He is very powerful Matthew. He doesn't want to hit the
one directly above the black. He is one of those shots where he would
like to ark the ball and go straight back into the pack. He
doesn't want to go straight into them. That is what he has done, you
see. It is fortunate to get one so easy, but that was a way of
splitting them. You can end up finding your white on the back
cushion behind the black, so he played that very well. You hope he
there is one available in the middle of the pack there. Of course
with the reds being split like that, if he does pot the red, he will be
bringing other reds into play. There you can see the red is on,
which is bound to bring at least the potting angle? The red just
above the one we were thinking. He is not certain to be able to cover
off that. Well, that wasn't the red that he wanted to be on. He was
running into other reds. OK, he e's got a chance at this blue and
there's not many better potters in the game than Matthew Stevens, but
he's a bit of work to do with the cue ball. If this blue was
straighter e, I don't think there would be a problem, but a little
to the right, so he could screw back for that, but he's got to cue
it well he did cue it well. you have eluded to that can get a
lot of action on the cue ball without having to hit it hard. It
is all about timing and delivering the cue and not accelerating when
you put the cue through. It's like my chipping at golf. It's improved
tremendously. It needed to, to be honest. Don't deaccelerate.
It is more of a chip than a chup these days. That's how bad our
tipping was. You should be getting the message. Trying to roll up
behind the brown and finishing 4 inches short of it. That is how bad
your chipping was. He's not guaranteed to be on the next red.
He's going to have to play a distance again and, as John
great Potters, so he's got a chance in this frame.
front. He could play this with a bit of confidence. It would be a
tricky black if he needed it. The fact he doesn't nobody it, makes it
I wonder if Dominic will carry on. It is a big ask. Two snookers to
tie. Probably two snookers   he could win with two snookers. Just a
safety. Let's see if Dominic is cushion there, made it a little
cushion there, made it a little easier for Dominique watch problem
now. I do not think the blue has come to his rescue. Just enough
Line9 There is a gap through the red. May even be able to get on a
blue funnily enough. There is a little window through the red away
from the black. There is a gap he can get through. He can't believe
that. He is apologising to come Nick. Second prize! Unbelievable
is just hard 20 work out how you can mist intended position by so
can mist intended position by so Maybe he does play to go into the
left corner pocket. Now it doesn't. Still not a bad chance. That is the
red to get on, the one to the left. So if he can get on that impossible
position. If he does, he will be able to release the black. If he is
straight on the yellow, he may decide to play for that red. He has
a lovely lazy cue action, has Matthew. Plenty of pace without the
seemingly hitting ball too hard. Feel as though that was the time to
play for the red, just above the black. Nicely on this one, needs a
good angle on the blue though off this red. I don't think the pink is
in play at the moment. And he can get the black into reply and think
about winning frame at this visit. Is the red he has been looking for,
the one just left of the black. There are things you can do on a
table now that were not available on a table years ago Yeah, true. He
wants to come down the right of the table, because those two reds are
the left of the black. They are available. Just the line and length
of this shot, well   it is a lovely line. And a pretty good length. Not
inch perfect. He ran maybe 2 inches too far. He may be able to push
through the red and play the black if he and the the play it that way.
Once again going for the blue. Hard work at the minute. He is ready to
play plenty of distance all the time. Could come unstuck soon.
he is almost through that by a good 2 feet. That is the problem, when
the cue ball starts the travel distances it is not that easy to
keep finding perfect position. This red may cut but with the cue ball
running lose he may not be certain which colour he has to be on. The
pot is difficult enough. Matthew always has a look at the potting
angle, where he would like to hit the red he is playing with the tip
of his cue to pot it. Good pot. He has an angle on the bounce because
these reds are lined up on the top cushion. Maybe a snooker behind the
green is the order of the day. It all depends on the angle he has on
the brown but he will do well to do well on the next. He just has a
slight angle. A big ask A difficult position trying to kiss the red and
the pink and hopefully mature that red. But he leads by 47 with six of
the red safe. I would be leaving that red next to the pink with 47
in front. The thing about playing it safe, maybe he is thinking about
Line9 Now a break from where the reds are. It is a free ball. In
fairness Dominique should pot the yellow, the blue then go into the
red. Is what they should be playing. Get back into the frame. If
Dominique is not feeling well I can forgive him for that but that is
just elementary to pot the yellow blue then the ball.   the blue. Is
what he has to do there. He has left this red, I think the one
above the black for Dominique. Of course he can judge the screw round
the two cushions off the black to the same pocket. Line9 Line9 These
Reds are very congested. With no Assume the red does not to go the
right corner. A little unlucky that, to be honest. It does not look as
if it is easiest of safety shots, either. Line9 Trying to get the
brown, maybe he can not avoid the kiss if the black if it is going to
way. Line9 The fact he was not on the red and the fact he could not
play a telling in safety. He said that he left the red near the
corner so Lynn courage Matthew to touch the ball maybe. The referee
always call as touching ball. Very touchy this sort of shot, isn't it?
There is a chance he flicks off this red, can he get in behind the
brown? Looks as though he possibly could. I know he is worried about
this red near the right corner, but... You have to be careful of a
push here, surely. A push is when the tip of the cue hits the cue
ball and the object ball simultaneously. He does not fancy
the thin off the red ball. Just a little top here. He fancies this
one even less. More than this one than the one on the left. Back did
the thin one trying to get in He wants to hit this as thin as he
possibly can. There is a strange swerve try to pot the red but there
is one left next to the black then it is possible. Trying to get the
white where it is again now. Far too thick if he pushes one over the
middle. 23 points in front is Matthew, so this is half a chance
for Dominique to get back into the frame. () You can see the
disappointment in his body language there. Is how important it is to
get top of the blue. If he plays it in and out he will do well to leave
the kiss on the brown. He may need inform run through the blue an
leave a long red. He has missed the brown. Hasn't missed the yellow
though, unlucky. Unlucky, he hit that really good. I cannot believe
in fairness once you have gone around that angle how you can kiss
the yellow. That's unlucky. If you had said that and he got near the
jaws of the pocket the red would not have come down the table with
the cue ball so Matthew now nine points the lead. This is a thin cut,
I think it is on. Of course the 2  all could resonate the top cushion,
but that is not going to make life any easier. Half a chance here for
Dominique. 10 points behind as he comes to the table. Nrgs Not the
best positioned shot. I know the would, you
would think the blue, but, um, a no give me, this. You would not
want to play it for too much pace. the opposite middle. Just under the
cross, so I assume this red passes the brown. Just enough. A good
clean pot and if it bounces enough it will be perfect on the black.
This black will put him 24 points in front, so just the yellow
required. Not the best shot that. He played to the side and did not
get any on. If he gets the side on he gets to slide to that black
cushion and gets a half ball yellow. So I do not think he is looking at
the saidy angle but looking at the safety shot. Yes, I'm a bit
surprised he thought to come off the cushion. He looked to be at an
angle where he could have come straight up the table with the
yellow. He only needs the yellow, but he is having to be patient.
Matthew Stevens forces his way through. A better chance.
() Well, it never rains but it pours, doesn't it? So that four 
point penalty means that he needed the snooker anyway but barring
pot. At least it stopped short of that fault line. Slow down, George!
that fault line. Slow down, George! He is OK. () I would assume
that this black would go back on its own spot. Dominique would
certainly look it to. Just a little bit on had hit there it is not
going to go on its own spot. I think he thought it may have had to
go as close to his own spot as it could. He did not think the pink
spot was available. () Being the wrong side of the blue
and of course the next intended is the red.. I would say he could just
about reach it and he has a full stretch. He has the yellow in his
way. Be careful he does not get close to it. Good pot. And if he
plays the canyon, certainly the black he would like to bring into
play. He is lucky really. In respect he did not bring too many
reds into play. But he can play for the black. Was not as bad as I
thought! Nice from Dominique. I think this red will pass the other
led. You can certainly see the right hand draw and if he plays it
slow he should be able to pot it. If he leaves an angle on the black
he will have to get into them an has the frame at his mercy. He
needs to win this frame. That's amazing. I like you thought that
red had went but he decided to play the plant. Mmmm. Strange choice of
shot from Dominique there, but when you hit the table you see it
completely different than we do in the commentary box. He does not
necessarily have to go low into this black. He just needs to get
the reds into this play. He came to the table 36 point behind. It
appears to be the last lose red he is playing now, so it is essential
to get the angle this time otherwise he will be kicking
himself he did not go into them last time. He has the angle so it
is OK. He needs to catch them fuller now. Has he been lucky? The
red has gone into the middle. Can he get past the yellow, to play the
pot? No. Looks as though it was a poor canyon he played, and he did
24, Matthew Stevens. I'm just looking at the potting angle, but
surely he is not looking at playing pot on, just playing a little
snooker. But I don't think he has hit it hard enough. It just cuts in,
but is unlikely he will play it because he cannot avoid a canyon on
the blue. Just a bit short of the pace here. This is a chance for
Dominique. He is getting to that stage he needs to be taking all
these half chances. Another one missed. This match is beginning to
slip away from him. I know he is not 100% health wise, but he has to
dig in here. He will be just ruined now the fact that he has given up a
good chance to clinch that frame. That was a pretty good shot but as
you can see he has hit too close to the black. The only thing is
because of the difficulty of the pot he did not really have much
control over the cue ball. He has left himself tight against the side
cushion. Now a lot will depend on the potting angle of this red. Is
it just at straightforward pot and you get this position, if he has to
do something with the cue ball then it is very difficult. Can he run
past the black for the black in the opposite corner? He struck that
beautifully, and he could. He had the natural angle so could not have
played it better. That black now puts him four points in the lead
the red is left on the table with colours and would be enough to give
him this frame. Just a little bit lower than he would have liked but
he still has the canyon on the red and if he can bring all three into
play... Did not play that very well. Just lost the cue ball a little bit.
Considering he was so close he played that beautifully. A good,
clean shot. Kept control of the cue ball. Brown now puts him 17 point
in front, but he is a bit short of pace. In fact, it was not so much
the pace. He just went into the brown too much. Came too down if
middle, if you like. He has been canonning the red but not certain
of his position. Helps. Has had a few little kisses today that have
worked for him. He played a shot early on when he played to get on
the blue and all of a sudden everything kissed and I was on the
black Yeah, that one looked as if he would have to play a very
difficult pink down the side cushion. The second red has come up
and a nudged him so he is on the blue. I think he can roll the blue
in, because he is on the last red. It will be a thin cut and he will
not be certain where the cue ball is going. He has a 23  point lead
and just needs this red. And a red. If he pots the brown, he will
be 28 point in front and it will be snooker required. When the balls
run nice, doesn't this game look easy? Yes, I think he has been the
dominant player regardless of hat colour ball he has had. But he has
had two pieces of outrageous good fortune to keep the rates going but
Dominique is OK. We know he is ill but he has had not too much chances
today, to be honest. He has been outplayed so far. Two very, very
nice breaks. 36 point behind but came to the table with 36 behind
and clears at 67 and Matthew Stevens goes one away from victory.
Dominic Dale as to win the remaining five frames. It will be a
tough order when you are feeling well. When you are not feeling too
well, even tougher. Well, believe me you cannot cue a ball better
than that. Right in the heart of the pocket. Look at the reaction he
got on the cue ball. A super shot. They do not hit them any sweeter
than that. They talk about Robertson. It was definitely the
given him a chapbs now to take frame and match. Open the red at
the top will be ready to pot so he will be getting on as soon as
possible. If the black pots he may be able to get on the red in the
middle. One of the reds he spotted to the left of the black has become
available. Just in case he played it further up the table. But   yeah,
there is plenty of room for the red, plenty of room. He would have wired
he had been a bit straighter on it now. Wishes the position he is in
now in potting, he might just canyon the black. A change of heart.
He tried to play for two reds. In that case it was not necessary. And
you would not expect him to miss this blue, though. I don't know
what that noise was. Someone stood on a cat's tail! Another excellent
shot from Matthew which has given him a chance now for frame and
match. There are still two or three lose reds. We said about his cue
pad, he has that lazy sort of style, but he can generate so much without
even the seemingly hitting ball too hard. Not many players can do that.
are talking about. His white went into the back and spun again. Looks
like he is in between, not nice on anything. Yes, but went into it
then the back spin took over and he went again. None of them are nice.
He has made a century break I think left handed. It looks like we might
see a left handed shot here t first of the match. () If I run
out of opposition that many times   I think it was a good pot but the
pace of it, he has overrun it, so it might just be a little trickle
Dominique is looking at his chair now and is definitely feeling not
so well. It took him an age to get wish Matthew Stevens to have won
the frame at that visit. As you say, he now lives in Berlin, so he has
got the journey home to contend with. Is not a good thing when you
are not 100%. He is trying to come round here and nestle into the side
of the red. This is the more difficult way to play it. He missed
the pink. Now it is done, but he found the gap. Which has left the
red on for Matthew. Nothing going That could have been a helpful
little bump off the middle pocket. When you play a thin pot you always
are likely to lose control of the cue ball. This Mew goes to the left
corner though. So I could are you could expect him to miss it. He
would have liked to to have played it better than that because he left
himself hampered. He just needed to stun across a little bit more. But
if you just watch   he just flicked the red and that is what has left
him hampered. In easy pot now, also it is the red he is closest to.. I
think that is the one he is going to take, John, to put the ex 
tension on. This will be a tough shot for the rest because you would
be trying to put the rest out of the way so it would be a lot easier
to put that long extension onto play this It is there, I think.
Only just. () The wrong side of the blue. It always looked
like it was going in and it just seem to go to the right hand tab.
We know there are two reds on the left hand side of the pot. It looks
like he will just leave the long shot. I know these reds are
I would much rather see a player do that rather than risk being
alongside the blue, get on the side of over screwing so if you are not
on the blue nicely, you have ball colour. If that is the case he will
finish as a resultly pinpoint perfect. I was thinking that
Matthew might go onto win the frame if he gives Dominique half a chance.
I did not expect him to miss this one. 42 point in front. He needs a
lot more. I think he is now struggling. Yes, I think he has not
conceded in his mind but he just knows that he is at the point where
he cannot   I mean, if he was to win this match, he would have to
win the next five frames and I do not think he has that in him at the
moment, the way he is feelinging, and of course the way Matthew
Stevens has been playing. But he has done well. He has turned up.
There was definitely a case of him not doing so. He went to the
hospital this morning and I think Shoots that to perfection. That red
going in, he is now 57 points in the lead, but there is still 59
remaining. He still needs the colour and he is not on it
perfectly. Just got a heavy contact off the first red which stopped the
pace of it as it was running off the next red. So it may be
worthwhile playing the cut on the black. If he pots the black, he is
64 points in front with 59 remaining. Well, he can play it as
a shot for nothing, can't he, John? He can get the gap an go wide up
the gene somewhere, so he does not have to play position. It is
definitely worth the risk. He can leave the white on the ball cushion.
There is one thing fort certain, there are not too many players who
would refuse it. Dominique sat there, a sad figure in a way, not
being as well as he is. In the end he decided not to but the black is
safe. It is a tough school this isn't it? No sympathy here. I have
to say I'm a little shocked. It will probably end up being the
right thing to do, but if he played the clip on the black, it wrote
have naturally gone through the white and the two reds and left the
white on the cushion. Dominique can still win now if he goes onto pot
the black. Where is the cue balancing go? Very close. A big ask
though as you say if Dominique did get a chance where the black is, he
is going to need   well, all blacks. That was a good result the other
day, wasn't it   England beating the All Blacks? Didn't see that one
coming. Well done England! I wonder where Dominique will play the deep
screw here? Very clever shot. Absolutely. Now Matthew wishes he
would have taken the clip there! Yes, 5 1 in front and just needing
one ball. I mean if he did not play the black, I mean funnily enough
going back to that situation given every chance he could have played
the blue, the way he potted that. You know, with a little safety,
but... I was his choice, but he will do well to get this safe. May
even have to take the pot on here. He has done well to get that save.
Is a excellent shot. The one thing about the Welsh players, it is a
hotbed of snooker of course. I'm not saying Matthew is from South
Wales, he is from Mid Wales, but they are the hotbed of snooker.
They know their way around the snooker table, don't they Will many
was one of the all time greats. meant on the safety margin they are
obviously Moree nouned for being one of the best mothers but he is
one of the best safety players in the world, make no mistake.
Dominique of course, Welsh. Great singer. Yes, he likes to do the Roy
Orbison, try him with the high notes! He goes into his play on
music is Pavarotti song, isn't it? He has a good snooker brain,
Matthew. As we said during the match, he has everything it takes.
I would not say an under achiever. He has been to the final of the
world championship twice. He has won this UK title once. ()
Well, that is unlucky. How can that happen? What a tremendous pot. He
desperately needed to be on the black or the pink. He is on neither.
Just look at Matthew's face. He just nodded his head thinking it
could happen. Let's have a look at it again. How did it happen?
concerned, I think, Dominique, I'm afraid. Even if you bolted the blue.
If he pots the black one he can get to the blue Maybe he can. Can he
see enough of this blue to pot tonight if he does, he can still
tie. He had to play the cut in the middle, and I would suggest that he
is very near a handshake now because snooker is required. How
unlucky was he there? He will be pretty pleased to be out of it. He
has done very well to turn up. Let's make no mistake. In fairness
he would have had to beat Matthew today the way he has played. In the
last two frames Dominique has not really competed. One of the game
ease great faces. He is a lovely lad but he has lost this match
into the next round. Matthew Stevens goes through against an
under the weather Dominic Dale. We will be back at 1 o'clock at the
