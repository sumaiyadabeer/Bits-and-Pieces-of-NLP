Three wishes set me free
Trust me, I'm a genie
  Wish one!
  And on that first day
  I got me very own cafe!
  Ta da!
  Wish two!
  That was cool
I got me own swimming pool!
  Hee hee!
  But then I dropped the magic can
It filled with sand
And the works got jammed!
  Wish three
  A total catastrophe!
The genie raved and ranted
But no third wish was granted
If one more wish comes true
Then I'll be free from you!
So trust me, I'm a genie.
Ah, this is the life! No cares, no worries.
  We're at the Oasiswood helipad,
where the Mayor is leaving for a surprise visit to...
Not here. Don't come here.
..the oasis!
No, I can't believe it!
  So the Mayor's coming. Big deal.
  What? The Mayor's completely crazy!
He'll turn the swimming pool into an octopus sanctuary.
Who knows what ideas he's got.
Y'know, sometimes you're just a big...
a big ideas kind of guy. Yeah!
I wouldn't have thought of using a wish to find out, like you did.
You're right, reading the Mayor's mind would help.
What if he likes sushiburger with chilli milkshake?
He would absolutely LOVE this cafe!
Reading the Mayor's mind could save my cafe?
  Let's do it! I wish to read the Mayor's mind.
  You got it!
I call upon the powers that be, grant this wish and set me free!
Huh! Not exactly hi tech, is it? How does it work?
Well, obviously you have to, erm...
  Ow!
  How about if I ask it nicely?
O great stone thingy, let me read the Mayor's mind.
Like I said, you just have to ask nicely.
Er, Ziggy, are you sure it's safe to be left in the sun like that?
Oh, it's OK. It must be searching for your brain.
It could take some time.
I thought it'd be more dangerous than this.
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, Ziggy!
I bet the Mayor wants my jewellery collection open to the public,
the twisted, sneaky, no good meddler!
What's the Mayor up to? What's his game?
What has he got planned? What will he do?
Wow, the Mayor's mind.
Strange how it doesn't know what it's up to.
  Weird voice, too.
  Hey, wait a minute.
If you're reading the Mayor's mind, how come I'm not free?
Y'know, in some ways, the Mayor's a bit like...
Zazie! Oh, noooo! We're in the wrong head!
  Scoop here, with a live update.
  Mr Mayor, what's the most important part of your visit?
  Well,
the most important part is that I'm in charge
and I can do what I like,
such as crush people's homes to make way for some really exciting chains.
I'm sure the good folk of the oasis will welcome you with open arms!
Whoa! Somebody bring the ground nearer!
  A lot nearer!
  Quit yelling! I'm trying to work out what happened.
Hey, you!
Leave our oasis alone!
OK, I get it. This is not real,
it's what Zazie's thinking. I'll try to change her mind.
Zazie, go to the cafe!
Yeah, go on to the cafe.
Or anywhere at ground level.
Go to the cafe!
Go to the cafe! Go to the cafe!
We did it! We changed Zazie's mind!
Right! So...where's me cafe?
  Ah!
  Wha'?
  There it is. Er, we're still in Zazie's head, right?
Zazie, repeat after me  
O crystal, please let Diego read the Mayor's mind.
  O crystal...
  ..please let Diego read the Mayor's mind.
Huh? Why did I say that?
Er, Diego, what's going on here?
Woah!
Yes, I know how the Mayor's mind works!
Give him a big welcome and he'll be no trouble.
Ooh!
I guess the crystal sent us to the wrong head again.
Larry, I want you to, er...
That's to say, the universe wants you to go to the cafe!
Cafe? Why, O universe?
Because there's a cosmic crystal waiting for you.
All my stuff! All my jewellery! I just don't like it!
  A cosmic crystal awaits me.
  Yeah?
Well, don't let the Mayor see it.
O universe, I have many complex questions about you.
Oh! Really?
So, if galaxies are like squashed pineapples,
then the universe is like a giant jelly
that's, er, shaped like a banana.
Wow! So weird!
But at the same time, so right.
Ziggy, do you think we could get a move on?
Scoop here, with an update. Good news!
The mayor will soon be arriving at the oasis.
Yes, I can't wait to see their tears.
Uh... The Mayor obviously means tears of joy.
No! I hate tears of joy!
Oh, look, I think I can just see the oasis in the distance.
When I've finished, you'll be able to see it from the moon!
Especially my new 50 storey cafe.
50 storey cafe? NOOO!
Universe calling Larry. I have an emergency mission for you.
There's something you must ask the cosmic crystal.
Larry did it! I can see the Mayor's helicopter. I'm going to be free!
Huh?
At last, the Mayor's head!
It feels right, too. Kinda empty.
There don't seem to be any thoughts.
Oh, no! We must have wiped the Mayor's mind!
Help! We're trapped inside a mindless official!
No! Hang on.
It's not a mindless official. It's a wooden horse!
Help! We're trapped inside a wooden horse!
It's OK, I've got an idea how to make this wish work.
If I just concentrate...
What a tiny cafe. I can't wait to tear it down.
Not far now. You'll soon be reading his thoughts.
Don't need to. He's broadcasting them live on TV.
Mr Mayor, you always do great things in our communities.
  Can you reveal your plans now?
  Yes.
I'm moving my headquarters to the oasis.
Well, who needs the city, with all those people against me?
  Here I could rule without a big fuss.
  Er, crystal thingy? Yoo hoo!
If you can hear me, could you let us out now, please?
We're in a wooden horse! You have to use wooden horse language.
  OK, leave it to me.
That's wooden horse language?
See? I told you!
Did I mention the 50 storey cafe by the octopus sanctuary?
I really must protest about...
Oh! Hi, folks. You can't destroy me cafe. It's...
It's... Well, it's just perfect as it is.
Do you know something? I hadn't noticed before,
Would you like to know what I'm thinking, Diego?
Yes! I would!
I mean, no! I don't want to read the Mayor's mind. Anything but that!
Wow! That would look GREAT on a chain!
This wish ain't over yet.
Hi, this is Scoop,
from what appears to be the brain of a not successful genie.
What's going on? Somebody get me out of here!
Anybody! Help!
The thing is, Mr Mayor, well, this is, like, completely normal.
It's what we do for fun at the oasis  
entering crazy genies' heads and so on.
Who you calling crazy, camel breath?
This isn't even particularly weird compared to some days.
You'll get used to it, though.
  Er, eventually.
  Nooo!
Nooo!
Why did you change your mind, Mr Mayor?
Is this your first and last visit to the oasis? Mr Mayor?
Well, howdy doo!
That was close. Really, really, really close.
I mean, I know I wished fair, but we got rid of the Mayor. Right, Ziggy?
  Where is it? It must be here somewhere!
  Er, Ziggy?
I think the crystal must have melted.
Hey! Keep your thoughts to yourself.
You're much too special for them, my precious!
