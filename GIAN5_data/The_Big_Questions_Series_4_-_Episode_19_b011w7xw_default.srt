Good morning. Welcome to The Big Questions. The press has been
hitting at the headlines, with the News International phone tapping
footballers, actors, bank managers and television presenters to stop
the press and from revealing their sexual shenanigans. Tens of
one very big question   is the press out of control? We are in
Croydon with an excellent audience, and City on the panel this morning
we have got the writer and former political spin doctor, Alastair
Campbell. On the Press Complaints Commission, Lindsay Nicholson. The
publicist, Max Clifford. And the As always, you can join in on the
message board. Just go to the website and followed the link. In
this instant age of the internet and social networking sites, the
press is in deep trouble. Fewer of us are buying papers and not enough
of us are prepared to pay for their content online so it is no surprise
that more and more newspapers have filled their pages with celebrity
gossip and intimate revelations in an effort to salvage sales figures.
Competing on tittle tattle is a cut throat business and sometimes
it has led to dishonest reporting and invasions of privacy. Is the
press out of control? Max? I don't think it is out of control.
Obviously you have to understand that, in order to survive, the
press need to give the public what the public wants. Like it or not in
Britain, the public love to know the private lives of the rich and
famous. That hasn't changed, but the answer is that obviously they
have got to be responsible and there has got to be a middle ground
between everybody's right to privacy and democracy, and the
freedom of the press. Is then not more of those types of stories than
there has ever been before? there was a lot more a few years
ago because it was easier to bring them out. In the last few years
there have been a lot less scandals because of super injunctions. As
long as you have got the money, you can virtually guarantee your
privacy so there has been probably less. Newspapers have all suffered
because of it, because the British public loves to read it. Some would
say you were the devil incarnate on this. For example, you helped
Rebecca Loos tell her story about her allegations about David Beckham,
Antonia de Sancha and David Mellor, so you have been involved in a few
colourful episodes. Probably a few hundred. But for every story I
broke, there has been half a dozen I have stopped. You are poacher and
gamekeeper at the same time. The reality is that, of the hundreds of
stories I have broken, in terms of real public interest you could
probably justify 20%, in my view. James O'Brien, he is right, isn't
he? If you see from pages on the Independent about global warming,
and the story may be concerning Helen have a three in a bed romp
with Wayne Rooney, which one will you read first? I would read the
Wayne Rooney story first, but I would like to think I would read
the global warming story second. It is a question of prioritising, but
also principle. I know this puts me in a minority of one at the moment
but I am not that bothered about right to privacy. Not in a minority
of one, clearly. But a right to secrecy is what we are describing
here. We are talking about be able to employ the most expensive
lawyers in the land to silence people from telling the truth about
things that you have done that you are ashamed of. My five year old
daughter likes to know why I couldn't take her to the park this
morning, and I try to explain what I was doing today. She said to me,
after I had given her a convoluted account of what we were embarking
upon, but she said "Daddy, if people are naughty, they should be
punished". I was quite proud. I thought, you are right. If you have
done it, if you have been found out, if you are caught with egg on your
face and your trousers down, there is nothing in the British
constitution that says you should be able to keep it secret. If you
don't want it on the front page, don't do it. Alistair? The problem
with that is it is a very self  serving media argument. The media
have conflated a definition of the public interest and what they think
there might be interested in on any given day. They are not the same
things. We do have a parliamentary system, a law has gone through
which gives people entitlement to both freedom of expression and some
sort of privacy, then the judges have to interpret the balance. All
that has happened in the last couple of weeks in relation to Ryan
Giggs coming to light is that parts of the media have decided they do
not support the judgment of the judge. If you read the judgment,
and I know Max was involved in this, it is far more complicated than the
way that the press are presenting it, which is this is an attack on
the freedom of the press. What journalists tend to do is to slant
their coverage to suit their own argument the whole time. We do have
to have a proper understanding of the difference between the public
interest and what the public are interested in. Ryan Giggs is a
footballer, not the Pope, not the Prime Minister, not running some
corporation. He talks about if he does something wrong, why? Why
should Ryan Giggs have to answer? will tell you why. We live in a
world where increasingly actions have no consequences, where people
like Ryan Giggs are perfectly happy to draw down large sums of money to
portray themselves... That is what he is paid to do. These people are
happy to pocket cash was being photographed on the pitch at the
end of the season carrying their children around. That is so self 
serving. Of course cities. For the media it is unfortunate. I would be
interested to know who in the audience likes reading those
stories. You may not be interested in who Helen and Sarah has slept
with, who we will speak to in a minute, but millions of people are.
I may well be interested, that is not the point. But the judges have
to interpret the law as it exists. Journalists and politicians are
usually the first to say we should uphold the law. The law says that
in our system the judges have to interpret these issues. Don't you
think they every something messy about a more that seems to be
overwhelmingly used by rich and powerful men to silence less rich
and less powerful women. That is another self serving media point
often made. It is a fact. It is only the wealthy who can take on
newspapers. That is not true. The Press Complaints Commission is free
and fair. Let's talk about the Press Complaints Commission later
on, but shall we speak to Helen now? Helen, you try to take an
injunction, didn't you? incident last September with Wayne
Rooney. I played ball and went ahead with the legal firm, did
everything I was asked to do. They said any injunction   well, an
application had been put in place after me begging for my name not to
come out, but they have no problem in putting me out of the press.
Apparently the injunction got declined, never mind what I thought
and how I felt, and how I was a mother and everything else. They
still decided to go and sell it. This was after basically the three 
in a bed incident with Wayne Rooney. A large amount of money was
transferred, but as far as you were concerned it was a private matter
between the three people involved. Yes, it was always a private matter.
When it came out, it was a year before that so everybody thinks it
is a kiss and tell their own. It wasn't like that for me, I am all
for privacy and I didn't want my sex life all over a tabloid. That
is why I never sold the story. It was seven days after the initial
story went in there, I thought there was no way I am not cashing
in. How much were you offered? When? Before the World Cup I was
offered 450. 450,000? Yes, I got told that is what I would be
looking out, which I declined. I denied everything about the thing
so that went away, but by the time it came round to mis selling my
story it probably wasn't worth doing anyway. Do you regret not
selling it and getting the money then? Yes, of course I do. I am not
going to lie, I would be stupid to say. Obviously I would rather have
450 grand. A couple of weeks ago you wrote in the Spectator, I think
it was Diary of a Call Girl or something like that, it was about
an actor because you are part of an injunction at the moment. A story
about an actor who shall remain unnamed, he has taken an injunction
to stop be talking about that. This comes down to the point about
hypocrisy, you said "if you are going to see escort girls, don't
brag about your squeaky clean private life. You are pushing your
luck". I didn't actually mean it like that. For a start, my work was
confidential. I never set out to sell a story on him because he was
an actor, but what started getting me really angry is that my name was
already through the mud anyway, I was an escort, people wanted to
portray me as what I was, but I never put myself out there to be
whiter than white. That is what he came are doing. I never said
anything bad about him, but when he started talking about certain
things, about what a fantastic role model and family man he was, I
thought why the hell am I being put out there to be this nasty person
and he was getting away with it. would defend Helen's right to sell
her story of she wanted to, and if the gentleman concerned wanted to
silence her, he could have outbid the newspaper and offered ï¿½850,000.
The central principle which Alastair chooses to ignore, is that
we are discussing a principle in which a British citizen could be
sent to jail in circumstances we know nothing about. It wouldn't
happen. I would rather be sure it couldn't happen. Show me the
example where it has happened. are discussing a very live news
evolution. It hasn't happened yet, the danger is that it could.
Somebody can't be named in court for the first time in the history
of the judicial system, you could have a trial in court where neither
the plaintive nor the defendant could be mentioned. That happens in
family law all the time. Let's concentrate on the content of the
newspapers, and of course it is relevant and we will come on to
those issues, but Helen and Sarah over there who has sold couple of
stories although she is now reformed, as his talent, they have
the right to do that. This is about their freedom of expression, isn't
It is a case of the court's finding a reasonable balance. It seems to
me we ought to have a national debate in Parliament about whether
we want a right of privacy, whether in America it doesn't exist, do we
want it here. We have inherited something from Europe and it
appears that people don't have an appetite for it, they don't want it.
Stennack has a large percentage of the population who say anyone is
fair game. If that is passed through Parliament, so be it. But
it has never been codified, we just have European legislation. That's
not true, the Human Rights Act was passed by the British government.
As it was. We don't have specific legislation. That is the
legislation our Parliament passed. When pushed, we lean towards
fevered    freedom of expression in favour... Judges interpret that.
Why do you think it is so important that people have the right to tell
their story? Alastair Campbell uses the word self serving. These
wayward male celebrities are the worst self serving celebrities
going. They can't parade their families in the glossing magazines
when it suits them and make a lot of money, like to the general
public. The public are tired of being lied to from the government,
MPs' expenses... You are tired of hearing the stories? Newspapers...
You used to ride soft porn, Alastair Campbell. Sex sells.
it sell as much as people think? You ask if the presses at of
control. It is not a question of that, they are desperate because
the pressures of the internet, 24 hour news, newspapers are not
really newspapers any more. They have decided, I think they are
wrong, that the only way they can stay alive is to fill their pages
every week with stories about the sex lives of celebrities.
Television creates celebrities and television these days, prison
company excepted, he is just as tabloid and the newspapers.
Newspapers build them up to knock them down. Why shouldn't she tell
her side of the story? She is entitled to issue one state. There
is an issue about client confidentiality ft up I understand
about confidentiality. I also don't see why it is one rule for one and
one for the other. It isn't if you have law and judges interpreting it.
For a you apologised to Kalim. I did mean it for dub    apologised
to Colleen. I did everything I was asked to do, I went along to the
meetings and spoke to his legal firm. I got nothing in return, I
was put out to the public. I still made a public apology to Colleen
which I still mean. Afterwards I was then... Money was trying to be
retrieved from me because I had caused unnecessary aggravation to
that family. How is that right? Aggravation had been caused to me
because somebody did not protect me in the first place. How much does
it cost to take out as super  injunction? ï¿½20,000, it is not
available to everyone. It is available to people who have a lot
to hide. One of the things people really object to is the idea of
celebrities that think they can turn publicity on and off like a
tap. I have something to promote, publicity on. Paul worked for the
News of the World. You have used a few underhand methods in your time,
including phone hacking. The super  injunctions invariably backfire
because the guy that we are not allowed to mention that Helen slept
with, I first knew his name via the various internet ways, I thought
who the hell is he? In a number    in another couple of months, he
will be much bigger than if he had put his hand up and said OK, might
have done. If you're not a football fan, a lot of people did not know
who Ryan Giggs was, everyone does now. As a lawyer I agree and now in
this climate, you advise a client not to spend money on a super 
injunction. You might as well put an advert in the local paper. It is
a waste of money. I have clients who a month ago I would have said
take out a super injunction because it is easy. I would make sure now
that they don't because it is changing. The reality of it is in
terms of talking about anybody, to me the TV star you have been
talking about has never played for family role, he has never played
the wife and family. Exactly the same with the footballer who I am
one of two people in the country whose name I can't mention. He has
never set himself up to that, he has just been a great footballer.
In my view, you take that into consideration when you are about to
invade someone's privacy and damaged their lives. So it depends
what you mean by setting yourself up as a family man. They cheat on
their wives and the super  injunction business is soap sexes.
We have not heard of a woman taking out a super injunction. It is a
man's world. Imogen Thomas was named in the injunction, named and
shamed in the injunction. All she did was to phone the famous
football and warned him that the Sun were looking into it. She had
nothing to do with... There is blackmail going on. That is an
allegation which is absolutely denied. A British court room
without anybody knowing who was doing the accusing. Richard
Peppiatt, former Daily Star journalist. Imogen Thomas has made
a career after selling her private life. She would never have been
eligible for an injunction. Who has she sold her private life on?
has done many interviews. She went camp with Jermain Defoe    went out
with Jermain Defoe and was offered fortunes, never sold her story on
the relationship. She was offered fortunes to suck    sell her story
on this footballer, no, I don't wish to talk to you for up get your
facts straight. Reality TV stars are always there to be famous for
Fame's sake. They have no right for an injunction. Get your facts
straight. I have. Have you ever tried taking out an injunction?
Is there a film called start starkers which you try to stop?
Up I have seen the letter. You're wrong. For footage that you were
discussing your client. They deceived me. Wait! I am going to
give Max a proper right of reply. If people want to have a pop at me,
fine. A M stating a fact. They came to film me about one thing, it was
a total deception. They made the film, foreign. Did I go after them?
No. You hired Carter Ruck to send them a letter threatening to enjoy
them. He denies it. As he likes reading the stories?    who likes?
I like to see people exposed who are trying to be whiter than white.
Nobody likes to admit to it, but everybody does. Who finds these
stories distasteful? Let's go to the gentleman in a dog collar. What
do you things    what do you think? I think it fuels a decline in moral
society. For example, the Telegraph has published a piece that they
have a picture of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on holiday,
but they will not publish it. That immediately sparked interest with
their readers. If the average man walking the street doesn't have the
option to enacted a super  injunction of the average woman
walking the street doesn't have the option to put her indiscretions
with somebody else in a national newspaper, why should anybody have
the option? I don't think the press is out of control. Is it none of
our business? For the press continues to fuel our interest and
then the British public makes it feels    feel like it is our
business. They've the public have to decide. We can have these
learned debates about the future of the media and so forth, but the
best selling newspaper this Sunday is still the News of the World.
worked under Piers Morgan as my first editor and we were doing 5
million copies a week and the press really was out of control. You
could do anything you wanted, you could sit outside people's houses
listening to their conversations on a scanner and write it were for
work. You remember the squidgy tape. That was great. What joy it was for
us, the little people, to get our own back on MI5 and MI6 who had
been doing it to us with government blessing. In 1950, the European
Court of Human Rights Act was passed to stop government invading
the privacy of the individuals and now they are turning it on their
heads, they are corrupting that law to say, we want our privacy from
newspapers genuinely investigating us. It is the corrupt politicians
who have hijacked a law that was supposed to stop them being corrupt
in the first place. Let's talk about the ethics of it. The whole
phone hacking business that is going on. It is nice that somebody
mention morals because they make a small point. Surely the principle
of privacy is not privacy somewhere that bad things happen and we do
bad things... Who has heard of someone doing something great in
private? You do something you are ashamed of, you are dishonouring
your wife, your line of cheating was dealing, and we have no other
way of judging whether or not our politicians will be able to cope
with difficult events that face them throughout the future of their
being in power. You have hacked phones. The only way we can judge
is by looking at their private lives and saying yes, he is an
honourable man, Tony Blair doesn't cheat on his wife, maybe he will
make it good Prime Minister. Tony Blair didn't have a mobile phone,
you could not do his phone. You did mind! Hacking someone's phone.
is in    honest enough to admit he has done worse. I interviewed him
and he admitted he did a lot worse than phone hacking and phone
hacking in this debate is the tip of a very murky iceberg. Is it the
tip of a very murky iceberg? suspect it is. We read all this
about Ryan Giggs, how much have we heard about phone hacking? There is
almost a media blackout. Why is that? Or that point, if you read
some newspapers, it is kind of like North Korea, you would not know
this phone hacking though it is going on. Absolutely, there is a
vow of a Murtagh. The papers in which you can read about this
subject are the smallest circulation papers. If you were a
regular reader of the red top tabloid, you probably would not
know unless you had seen it on the BBC about phone hacking at all. It
gets worse and worse and they write less and less about it. It never
used to be a crime until 2000. It used to be something everybody
could do and they were all happy about it. Showbiz tittle tattle,
people desperate to get into the papers and magazines in any way
possible. I am possibly sitting next to a good example. People like
Max Clifford are desperately hypocritical to go after the News
of the World for hacking into his own when he has made a fortune on
the basis of selling this kind of tittle tattle. He is saying you
should not do it to me. You are getting it from all sides, Max!
enjoy that. You think that because I dealt with the News of the World
for 30 to 40 years, they have the right... To listen to my phone
calls, is that right? Let's agree to disagree. A lot of the stories
you got from the celebrities that you made a fortune out of work got
through means that we would now say are against the Data Protection Act.
Not with my knowledge or insight, ever. If they were doing that, they
were doing that, but I was totally unaware of that and I was totally
unaware they were hacking my phone. I fell out with the News of the
World. I accepted the fact that a dull it was just a silly game.
him answer. I accepted the fact I was a fair target because I had
fallen out with Andy Coulson and I would not deal with the News of the
World. I still with the Sunday Times and the Times and the Times
because that is the heart of my business, along with TV and the
other media. When I found out, I sorted it out. I dealt with,
eventually, I got no help from the Press Complaints Commission, and I
got no help from the police. I sorted out my phone hacking
situation myself and finalised it and moved on. You have been playing
the game for so long, why do you suddenly see it as a crime and not
just part of the game? I do see it as part of the game. I played the
game with them and when they did that, I took them on and I sorted
it out. Sarah? You once told me that no newspaper in this land
would ever print about story about any of your secrets because you
were to respected. Do you think that is a way of keeping yourself...
That is not true. You only have to read the papers about Simon Cowell
to say... I said about you. course, there might have been
things come out about me and Spy catcher... Sexual things. The star
came up with something meant to embarrass me. Let's talk about
phone hacking. The PCC said there was no evidence anyone else at the
News of the World two years ago... Let me finish the quote. I started
so I'll finish. No evidence anyone else at the News of the World knew
about Goodman's activities, he was the first person finger on this.
Doesn't that show how useless the PCC is? Phone hacking is a criminal
act which can only be investigated by the police. The PCC has no
investigative powers. Why did it say? What they said at the time was
as they understood it at the time. It is alive criminal investigation
and you can't interfere with that. When that is completed, the PCC
will review it again. It has a committee working on it now. It
will be reviewed to see what they could have done at that point. The
PCC is not there to investigate The PCC took the line from the
newspaper group concerned. You have got the Press Complaints Commission,
the Press Standards Board of Finance which is totally made up of
media figures, the key person on the editor's code is the editor of
the male. It is like putting Harold Shipman in charge of the GMC. It is
a complete joke. It is an organisation for the media of the
media by the media, and the public   Lindsay will now say they have
all of these lay commissioners and the rest of it. I have heard the
argument so much. The Press Complaints Commission is not an
effective self  regulatory body and the only reason there is an
argument the PCC has totally failed. There are a majority of lay
commissioners. How many non media people? None. It pulls the strings
of the PCC. It pays their wages, it has the top media people running
the Press Complaints Commission. has taken an awful long time for
this to come out, two years. Maybe the end is the man to talk to about
this. Certainly the investigation... Are you useless or quite good?
Personally, I think we are trying to get to the bottom of what
happened. What happened in 2006 was essentially the job of the
Metropolitan police to carry out an investigation into criminal
behaviours. What the PCC did is something I am others are looking
into at the moment. Clearly we were misled, the wider public was misled,
and we need to make sure it doesn't happen again. You were misled by
the people who paid your wages. the idea that somehow the PCC is
governed by the press I would completely refute. Alastair was
making the point you were misled by the people paying your wages so
there was an unhealthy structural relationship going on. This is not
their job, it is something they do in addition to their main job so
the money that we receive is certainly by no means paying our
mortgages and daily lives so we are not receiving money we depend on.
We get paid because we devote time to this but personally I do this
because I want to ensure the press work to a high standard. I have
never met Paul Baker, never been contacted to tell me what to do. I
continued to exercise my judgment. So on times you have to stand up
and say this is a really bad more. Do you think phone hacking should
then be a crime? It never used to be. The people who made it a crime
in 2000 only did so because we were catching them with their
secretaries fiddling their expenses, and they were sick of being caught
out. Let's hear him out. In it was made a crime by the politicians
that we kept catching being corrupt and lying to us. We are talking
about it as if my colleagues are getting arrested and sent to jail
for writing the truth. Is this Stalinist Russia? Richard. I have
worked at the Daily Star, I have worked at various national
newspapers and the lies of tabloid journalists are not clean. I find
it hypocritical that at one moment you can be writing about the drugs
and affairs of other people, while the people writing about it are
involved in exactly those things. But you are not famous. Fine, I
know that, but morality does not make any sort of distinction.
you had had a three in a bed session may be with you, Nick,
maybe with Helen for example, we might be vaguely interested because
Nick is a lawyer on the television sometimes but we wouldn't have been
interested in your revolt    involvement. But it might hurt my
girlfriend. It is a slightly naive perception of what the public think
about the people who'd do these jobs. To reveal that journalists
are debauched and corrupt will not make front page news. In a very
gentle civilised way, Brian is trying to come in here. One of the
things this scandal tells us is that it is not just about
celebrities, not just about rich and powerful people. If you look at
the people they have been hacking, right down the list it goes to in
the Siena Miller case they were not just hacking her, they were packing
all of her ex boyfriend, her mother, her stepmother. They had reams of
numbers relating to her. They have been known to hark rape victims. It
is not restricted to celebrities and that is a big issue across this.
Everybody is vulnerable. If we talk about privacy and the rich and
famous protecting themselves, everybody is vulnerable. If you can
pry into Ryan Giggs' life, the law will tell you you can pry into
everybody else's life and that includes you and me, anybody who
might be a victim of crime, who might be bereaved. Chris Jeffries
is a good example. He was the landlord of Joanna Yates. All he
did was have a funny haircut and they decided to go to town on him,
find disgruntled ex pupils and so on. If it suits them, anyone can
wake up... You have a few accusations to answer. If anyone
else wants to say something, I will come over in a very gentle and
civilised way and bring you win. you want to live in a free and open
society with nice politicians like nice Nick Clegg and not Colonel
Gaddafi, you have got to have a system. What about the collateral
damage, the people involved, the children, the family's?
shouldn't be doing it in the first place, he is the one causing the
collateral damage. So you would say that about Gordon Ramsay for
example? Absolutely. What about people like Wayne Rooney's wife,
why do you think they get away with it for so long? Because of the
wives turned a blind eye because they have sold their souls for the
lifestyle. They are as bad as the guy doing it. Helen, you were a
professional, you were doing that as a job. Yes, I think the whole
thing we are talking about now is, to a degree the phone hacking thing
is taking it to a different limits, but the public wants to read
certain things and the men are going out and doing these things.
Until that stops, it will just continue. Adultery is not
restricted to celebrities, I'm afraid. It is happening everywhere.
It may be that adultery of famous people is more interesting. But no
one is interested. Ian. The press play a very important part in our
society, they have a very effective role, exercising power and that
comes with responsibility. My job as a member of the Press Complaints
Commission is to hold some of them accountable. I am not accepting
their behaviour in a whole variety of situations, but I think in
response to the general question, the press is not out of control.
There was a piece about Stephen Gately in the Mail which caused
huge offence. The judged on that was that there was no censor at all.
It is not about censorship. The PCC does not rule on grounds of taste.
The members of the PCC admitted it was not tasteful but it didn't
break the code. Because the code is written by the chair man who was
also the editor of the Daily Mail. At the piece was rancid. So that is
all right, rancid opinion, that is your job, isn't it? Rancid opinions
are fine, yes? Absolutely. If you don't like what she writes, don't
buy the Daily Mail. On the point you raised about politicians, the
MPs' expenses scandal was broken because money was paid to buy it
illegally obtained information. They broke the Data Protection Act
and no journalists were prosecuted. They were not prosecuted because
there was a clear public interest. When you talk about phone hacking,
if you had a politician's phone and found something in the public
interest, the CPS would not prosecute you. What about the
subterfuge recording Lib Dem MPs, through which we eventually found
out that Vince Cable had an agenda about Rupert Murdoch. Was that in
the public interest? The PCC ruled against the Telegraph. That was
because they didn't know what they were going to get before they went
out. The code is actually, what ever Alastair says, it is very
strict and clearly defined. In that case, the Daily Telegraph did not
break the code. That information about Vince Cable was surely in the
public interest? I think it was. Actually that would have been a
rare occasion when I think I was surprised from the other angle that
the PCC humbled at how it did. is wrong with bending the rules a
little bit so we can write the truth? We should be applauding
journalists for writing the truth. Are you worried about the general...
Have you had death threats? Many, but not from the police. I have had
a request to go to Scotland Yard to be interviewed under caution.
should go, it is your democratic duty. That is the first time anyone
has mentioned Scotland Yard in the context of this entire conversation.
I hold no brief for the PCC. They took Scotland Yard's analysis of
the situation. Which is the same. It is worth pointing out. Even if
the PCC had caught the News of the World bang to rights, there is no
power to fine, to do anything, and that is where the PCC fails
miserably. If I may talk to Richard, because you wrote this letter to
Richard Desmond. You were a daily Star journalist for a couple of
years and then you wrote this letter to the big boss saying I
have had enough. I don't want to do this sort of stuff any more, and
this is where you come in because you were teaching young journalist.
What was the worst you did? For me the real quitting point was making
up stories to do with Islam and Muslims, and really demonising a
whole section of the community. Cherry picking quotes, I really
felt it was blatant lies going in the paper every day, things that
MacLaurin at the cracks in our society. Can I make important
points about this. The PCC, you can be as vile as you want about Islam
and nobody can complain to the PCC because it has to be an individual
who was written about in a way that is damaging, and secondly Desmond's
papers have pulled out of the PCC anyway so they are covered in no
way whatsoever. How can you see that self regulation can continue
when one of the biggest publishers isn't even involved any more?
hope they will be back in, it is a real problem. It won't happen. You
need to have a system that is compulsory, that can find heavily.
No Sunday Express, don't Daily Express, no daily Star, no Sunday
staff. They are not ruled on by the PCC. They can ride whatever they
want. Over here is a man who teaches young journalists. Are you
worried about some of the things they will be compelled to do when
they join a newspaper? If yes, we teach undergraduates. They spend
three years with us and we teach them ethics, the more, have to be
responsible journalist, we teach them that journalism is something
you do in the public interest to make the world a better place.
only way is ethics, that is your message. Indeed. I really worry
that some of them do end up in these places and they are asked to
do scandalous things which they should not be asked to do. Let's go
accordions be used on this. A hand went up just as I said it.
purpose of the press should be to expose injustice, not perpetuate it.
For a gentleman like yourself, to admit himself that he has
questionable moral standards to ask as judge and executioner... No, the
people who act as jury are the people who take money out of their
pocket and pay for it. If you like it, you carry on buying it and that
is why the News of the World is still doing 3 million copies a week.
It is naive to say we have complete the mission over what we think. The
best influences public opinion and Wise and to fit    simple thing put
in place whereby if there is an inaccuracy or defamation printed
about somebody, why isn't the same prominence given to the apology?
The editors don't want it. Would that not be any easy thing to
instigate? Most of the apologies and adjudications are posted either
further forward in the paper or at the same place in the paper where
they were published. Clearly there is an issue about how much of the
paper you take up, but I personally don't believe in the argument that
the apology has to be the same size of the story. Would that not make
them think twice? Our evidence suggests editors think twice every
time they have to waste any part of the paper because they have to
publish an adjudication. I am glad Richard has brought up his reasons
for leaving the Daily Star, the letter he published was probably
the most articulate and principled thing I have ever read by a red top
journalist. It was about this bizarre the deal driven agenda that
was being displayed by the paper and its rancid at due to Islam. The
other great bete noire of the media at the moment other than Islam or
immigration is the benefits claimants. The PCC upheld the
complaint to gives the Telegraph recently which appeared on page two.
It was a story about people claiming infertility benefit having
been found to be 70% of them being fit to work. I present a radio
phone in and there are certain subjects that will light up your
switchboard. It goes off like a firework. It is a certain type of
caller. It depends how you ask the questions. 70% of people claiming
the invalidity benefit were fit for work, it was printed as fact.
Nothing left Denny wiggle room. I read this apology by accident
because I'm normally don't get to the bottom of the news in briefs.
It turned out that in this actual pilot scheme in these two pilot
schemes, 30% of people on invalidity benefit had declined to
continue with their claim rather than be examined. 30%, not 70%,
were ostensibly fraudulent and 39% of them had been found to be unable
to work but with help, possibly put in a position where they would be
able to work. You have created in the public's mind the notion that
70% of society's most vulnerable benefit claimants are liars,
defrauding the public and are taking money they are not entitled
to. The truth was 30%, the apology was that big and unless you listen
to my radio show, you would not know the truth. It is a very good
radio show! This would be easy to fix, the same prominence. There are
discussions under way. There have been paid one apologies that have
been put in. The Sunday Express over Tom Cruise. More than one. It
is absolutely under discussion. But these things... Why is it not a no 
brainer? Discussions have been going on for years and the editors
don't want to do it for obvious reasons. They are trying to sell
their papers. Sorry? Broadcasters, if they get something wrong, they
don't have to give the same length of apology... They are regulated.
would be fired if I got it wrong. Some people are arguing for tighter
controls, but Alastair Campbell, it is all very well having tidied
controls when the real exciting, dynamic conduit of information in
the modern age, the internet, Twitter, has no controls. Those
controls may come. Those controls may come? They may do, you may have
to do. The thing about the internet is it is international, there is no
geographical boundary. Anything done would have to be done on a
global basis. There is probably not the political will for that. We
were talking about President Obama, or whether he would be interested.
It is unlikely in the short term for that to change things. You have
to operate within the law as it is, then the parliamentarians have to
decide whether this change, and it is a change, means they have to
change the law. Twitter is great fun, it has a great way to convey
information, but it is not particularly high minded, is it?
All of these names, names of people who were not involved. It doesn't
have the same impact. I never mind if any of my clients are being
slagged off on Twitter because it doesn't have anything like the same
influence. There are various stars I have known that have taken out
injunctions and have been mention many, many times but the feeling is,
it doesn't have the same consequence as if it is on the
front page of a newspaper. Is that an old fashioned attitude? It has
to be responsible. The whole thing about this is responsibility. The
word is justification. If you are going to invade privacy, you have
to justify it, not just do it for the sake of circulation and tittle 
tattle for Bob I am saying that as somebody who has probably had more
stories than anybody. It has to be true. David Mellor in the Chelsea
strip, he wasn't wearing a Chelsea strip. I did not do the interview.
The Chelsea strip was embellishment. Helen, how do you feel about the
fact that the guy who has been injunction out at the moment which
involves you, the actor whose name shall remain nameless, we can go on
to Twitter and find out who it is, how do you feel about that? I think
it is a shame that the court but an order out for it not to come out
and an injunction has been put in for a purpose and then something
like a social network has stuck it out there. It has not affected me
at all, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. It is about there and it
has made a mockery. Do you wish it was there are generally speaking?
feel more sorry for the people that have been put out there that have
nothing to do with this. If it wasn't for Twitter, I would not
know the name of the game that has the injunction against you. Twitter
is very, very important. Most of the stuff on there is true.
reason we need a privacy law is because of the internet. The other
day I got my wallet nicked. I searched Google for wallets. For a
whole week, on every internet I went to, there were wallet adverts.
It is because my search engine result kept it. If you upload your
photographs to Facebook, Facebook owns your photographs. The amount
of information that corporations store about you, do you think we
need no privacy laws? This is why privacy is important. Two people
searching on Google will have different results because they know
a huge amount about you. It is not about journalism any more. It is
about corporations storing your whole life story. That is the kind
of privacy law we need? We need a privacy law which protects us from
corporate intrusion. I don't argue with that because we need a privacy
law to protect us from the government, as indeed it was
supposed to do in the first place. You're wrong on this. Privacy law
and the public interest test already let us know about
politicians. What we don't get to know about is what Ryan Giggs get
up to. You will never lose a case when you write a story about a
politician in this country, ever. Why internet journalism is a
problem, I don't know why everybody has such a downer on journalism, it
is a difficult job, we trained for longer than a doctor takes to get
qualified. Three years at university and two years...
didn't do that! Her the reason why internet journalism is so poor is
because they don't have any proper journalists, it is so expensive to
do a proper story. So expensive to do a proper story, to put the
resources into it. I was looking into an affair between the producer
of a CDC and one of his starlets. I drove all the way to Geneva and
knocked on his door and asked if he was getting divorced. He said yes.
I got paid ï¿½2,000 to do that because of the mileage and the
distances. That story had been running on the internet for months
previously and that was the first bit of genuine information, the
National Enquirer said he said this. But we have had months of
speculation and nonsense, but no one was rich enough to pay a single
journalist to go to Geneva and knock on his door and ask him a
question. It is really hard work being a journalist... Everyone is a
gem is now, everyone has a block. Pork is a little bit behind the
times. What you describe is accurate, but not necessarily lead
inevitable for ever. A Twitter well evolve. It already is evolving. The
way the two girls who had not had affairs used it, Gabby Logan went
public to deny it. That is self  regulation at work in the way the
PCC can't. I was accused last week on Twitter of having a super 
injunction out about my affair with Susan Doyle and I deny that
straight away. I thought she denied it! I thought the point... Dreaming
the impossible dream. I think that is absolutely right, the point
about his privacy debate. We probably are talking about the last
stages of the privacy debate, but the next one is where that
gentleman is taking it. That is why the G8, a couple of years ago   
weeks ago, Sarkozy called and the guys from Google and Facebook and
they are now saying they should be entitled to do this. Where is this
going? What kind of press will we have in 10 years? The times are
changing. I think... I don't think we can just talk about the tabloid
press, because the whole media has become more tabloid. Broadsheets
and television that now do stories that once only the tabloids would
do. It has become much more downmarket. The pressures of
competition are taking them further downmarket and I think there will
come a point where the public turns against it. What they think    they
think they are saving themselves with the sex and tittle tattle, but
I think they are destroying themselves and eventually online
media will become more predominant. And we need an independent PCC?
That is up for debate. But the PCC was set up 20 years ago because the
press was thought to be out of control. During egregious, awful
things like pounding Russell Harty as he lay on his deathbed and
making... They did that to Gail Porter last week. There are many,
many more restrictions on the activities of the press, even
though the people working on newspapers, there are few of them,
Veron more newspapers and more competition, they are under more
pressure. But something like Twitter it will change it again, it
is always changing. A Max. For I think the answer I hope is with the
Press Complaints Commission, but they do tend cent of what they
should do. Hopefully in the years to come they will have increasing
power and increasing independence and be able to do the things they
should be doing so that we get a fair and responsible and free press.
But the one thing I would point out is that with all the phone hacking
that has been going on and all the coverage of News International, it
has not spoilt their circulation. People will always want to read
about sex and tittle tattle. answer is with the public. As long
as the public want to know anything they can find out, they don't want
their private lives out there, but they want to know about everybody
else's, it won't change. James. Twitter will drive a coach and
horses through the in Continent injunction plea that we have seen
recently because High Court judges don't feel the sex lives of public
figures should be fair game. Anyone familiar with the tabloids of the
70s and 80s would arrive at its conclusion as to why High Court
judges might be keen to protect the sexual proclivities of high that
public figures. Whether or not the public appetite for salacious
tittle tattle will diminish, I can't see it happening. Would you
