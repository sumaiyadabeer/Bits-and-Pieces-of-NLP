Welcome to Limmy's Show.
Imagine you're in a record shop and you saw that.
You'd be like this...
Wouldn't you?
Welcome back to Adventure Call, where we rejoin Stevie on line two.
All right, Falconhoof?
Do you realise, Stevie, that you are on the verge
Aye. Can we just get oan wi' it, mate?
  That's half and hour I've been playing this, c'mon.
  Very well.
As you recall, we are in a marble hallway.
In the centre is a statue of Hermes.
To the east is a tunnel of no return.
  Right...
  And to the west is a maze.
Kiss feet of Hermes.
You kiss the feet of Hermes?
A pair of winged sandals appears next to...
Yes! Get winged sandals!
  I told you, didn't ah?
  I must warn you again, Stevie,
that I cannot receive your instructions
until I have finished describing the environment to the viewers at home.
Right, well hurry up then.
A pair of winged sandals appear next to the feet of Hermes.
What would you like to do?
Enter tunnel.
Are you sure?
Move! You're stalling for time.
  Aye, they try to squeeze every penny oot o' you.
  Very well.
The tunnel takes you north.
As you exit, it vanishes behind you.
You now stand before the chasm of fire.
To the east is a maze. To the north, at the other side of the chasm is...
the Black Ruby of Voldesade.
Yes! Jump the chasm.
Be careful.
The chasm cannot be jumped by mere mortals.
Aye, but I'm no' a mere mortal.
I'm wearing the winged sandals, so just jump.
  You are not.
  I'm no' what?
You are not wearing the winged sandals.
How no?
  You do not have them.
  Aye, I do.
  You do not.
  Well, where are they?
They are next to the feet of Hermes.
What are they daen there?
I told you to get them, I told you I wanted to wear them.
  You did not.
  Aye, I did!
No, you didnae... No, you did not.
You gave me the instructions to get the winged sandals
while I was describing the surroundings,
  and I made it clear that...
  Naw.
  Naw, naw, no, mate. That is petty, that is petty.
  It is not petty.
I advised you that I could not receive your instructions until...
But you heard me! You heard me tell you
to get the winged sandals,
and you left them behind without warning me,
just to prove a point.
I did warn you, I did warn you.
No, look, here's what we're gonna do, right?
You could enter the maze to return to the marble hallway.
Right, and add another 50 quid to my phone bill?
Naw, mate, here's what's going to happen, are you listening?
  Yes.
  I'm going to jump over that chasm of fire.
I'm going to reach the other side.
And I'm going to get that Black Ruby...
  You will not.
  I better, mate.
I'm going to get to the other side and I'm going to get that black ruby.
And I'm going to get my two grand.
You will not make it, traveller.
I better mate, I'm warning you. Jump the chasm.
You will need the winged sandals.
I've got them. I told you to get them, I've got them.
  Now jump the chasm.
  Traveller...
Jump the chasm!
OK. You jump the chasm.
You make a pitiful jump into the flames...
Nawwwww! You better no' have, mate!
  ..You are burnt to a cinder. You are dead.
  No!
You're dead, mate, you're dead!
You've just cost me two grand!
You are a dead man. I'm going to find out where you drink
and you are a fu...!
We're ready to take another caller.
My name is Falconhoof, and I will be your guide on your quest.
  Will you be ma da?
You know what I hate?
I hate that when I want crisps...
I get chips.
When I want fish and chips...
they come wi' fries.
I hate that the flats are noo called apartments.
I hate that sweets are now called candy.
And I hate that instead of nippin' oot to the shops, you nip oot to the convenience store. I hate it.
I hate when we use American words in place of words that we've already got for they words.
Just because it's cool. Well, tell me, is this cool?
There you've got an old woman, and she's needing her prescription
for her chronic back pain and her bad heart.
But she's no getting it because she's looking for her chemist,
the same chemist she's been gaun tae for the last 30 year.
But she cannae find it, because there in its place is...
Lloydspharmacy.
Lloydspharmacy! Some trendy cocktail bar, some trendy clathes shop called Lloydspharmacy.
Lloydspharmacy, one word.
And she's heading up the road, confused, thinking she's losing her marbles,
and she's gaun to her bed wi' her back killing her, and she's dying in her fucking sleep.
Noo, that's no cool, because that's oor granny.
That's your granny.
That's a'body's granny!
Whoo!
Hey!
Shit.
I wanna have dinner with Gershwin...
You want to have dinner with Gershwin?
The composer, George Gerswhin?
He's been deid for aboot 70 years.
What ye gonnae dae? Dig his corpse up and stick it at the end o' your dinner table?
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch...
You want to watch Rembrandt sketch?
He wouldnae let ye.
Artists are notorious for no letting anybody see their work before it's finished so...
I want to talk theory with Curie...
Curie? Marie Curie?
You want to talk about the theory of radioactivity with Marie Curie?
Donna, you wouldnae have a clue what she was on aboot.
Even if you could speak Polish.
Ooh, impossible, I guess...
You said it.
What's goin' oan here, like?
We need to talk.
  What aboot?
  I want to split up.
  Split up? What for?
  I'm fed up. Really fed up.
I've been fed up for years. We don't go oot, we don't dae anythin'.
I don't understaun, this is oot aw the blue.
I thought we were getting oan. What's happened?
Nothing's happened, that's what's wrang. I feel like...
I feel like I'm...
We're no...
We're no what? What's wrang?
Och, I don't know.
I'm talking shite, just forget it.
Is everything all right?
Aye.
  Hello, reception.
  Cathy, have the police called today?
  No.
  Have they been in the building at any point?
  Not that I'm aware of. Are you expecting them?
No, no, not at all, just checking, thank you.
That's no call for complacency, the police could walk in the door at any moment, and you don't have a story.
Hello, officer, how can I help you?
Er, Mr Mulvaney, do you reside anywhere near the Drumchapel area of Glasgow?
Drumchapel? Nowhere near it, fortunately. Er, why?
Ah, well, eh, last night an incident occurred between the hours of...
I see, well, that's, er, that's quite depressing.
It's incidents like that that give Drumchapel a bad name.
I hope you catch the chap.
Er, well, Mr Mulvaney, we actually have reason to believe that it was you who...
Me?
Are you joking?
Officer, I'm 62 years of age.
Why on earth would I vandalise a bus shelter?
Er, well, written on the bus shelter was a name and it said...
But there must be thousands of Mulvaneys out there   what makes you think it was this one?
Oh, that's good, that was... PHONE RINGS
And if I was to write my name on a bus shelter, officer, I don't think I'd use a lighter. Cathy?
Mr McMillan rang to say that the accounts are waiting for you now.
Oh, that's great. And, Cathy, if the police do arrive, you can just send them right on in.
No bother.
But, officer, there must be thousands of Mulvaneys out there. Oh, that's goooood.
There are girls in your area!
Girls in your area!
Right here, right now!
Girls!
Oh,
sometimes it's just a bit too...
pow! Pow!
Do you know what I mean?
All right, I tell you what we're gonna do, we're gonna get a divorce.
For what you did, we'll get a divorce,
I'm gonna get the kids, and I'm gonna bring them up to hate you!
Computer   locate this man.
Located.
  On screen.
  On screen.
Computer, activate the teleportation portal.
Activated.
Computer   position the destination portal just behind that lassie's arse, eh?
Positioned.
Oh!
Oh, no, that's just childish. This is childish.
If you're still using a phonebox in this day and age,
then you're either a drug addict
or a drug dealer or something like that.
Fact.

Yeah. Do your little turn.
Dance, dance, dance!
Yo, daddy o.
Oh!

No, him.
Aye, these blondes. You know, these blonde lassies.
That's aw you hear aboot  
a leggy blonde, a sexy blonde, innit?
  Aye.
  Aye, well, here's what they don't tell ye.
See when wan aw them comes ower here frae Sweden   cos that's where they're aw come frae  
they cannae believe their luck.
All of a sudden, everybody wants their wicked way wi' them.
Whereas back hame they don't get a second look.
  Do you want to know why that is?
  Why?
Cos see in Sweden,
d'you know what a blonde is?
What?
A ginger.
Blondes are ginger.
Shit.
'Fucking...
'I was in ma kitchen, right?
'Checkin' to see if my t shirt was dry, right?
'And I just burst oot laughing.
'Cos on the label of my t shirt,
'it said "George" cos I got it frae Asda.
'And it was as if, every time I leave the kitchen, everything in the kitchen springs tae life.
'Like Toy Story.
'And his name's George.
'I was pissin' masel'.
'Just imagine the slagging he must get from the rest of the kitchen,
'like that, fuckin'... Georgy Porgy pudding and pie kissed the girls and made them cry.
'But then I thought, "Naw, maybe no."
'Don't me wrang, I've got nae doubt that his nickname's Georgy Porgy,
'but it might be one of they nicknames that they don't dare call him to his face,
'like Joe Bananas.
'Cos if ye ever called Joe Bananas "Joe Bananas",
'he'd fuckin' go bananas.
'Well, maybe if ye call Georgy Porgy "Georgy Porgy",
'he fuckin' goes bananas.
'But then I thought, "Naw, maybe no."
'Cos it's no as if a t shirt's gonnae be the hard man of the kitchen.
'That would probably be...
'the kitchen knife.
'But then I thought, "Naw, haud oan."
'Kitchen knife in a fight against...
'..the frying pan   frying pan would win.
'Kitchen knife in a fight against the chopping board   chopping board would win.
'Chopping board widnae even feel it.
'Chopping boards are made to no gie a fuck aboot kitchen knives.
'Kitchen knife in a fight against me?
'Aye, the kitchen knife would win. But I'm the only wan in the kitchen the kitchen knife would win against.
'And I just thought that I bet the rest of the kitchen are onto that,
'and pure take the piss oot the kitchen knife, bullyin' it, grog oan it.
'And that got me worried.
'Cos it reminded me of they schoolboys you get in America that get bullied.
'But then they come into school wan day and kill everybody.
'And cos I'm the only wan in the kitchen the kitchen knife can kill, aye, that got me worried.
'So I just thought, "Look, you've came in, you've checked your t shirt,
' "it's no dry yet, just get oot and leave them tae it."
'Noo, I'm no sayin' that my kitchen actually does come to life when I leave, right?
'I'm no mental or anything.
'But see as I was walking oot,
'see ma frying pan,
'I gave it a wee dunt.
'I gave it a wee dunt in front of the kitchen knife.
'Just in case.'

Until I realised why. Look.
Nae pubes.
Noo it doesnae bother me at aw.
Ah!
Well, ladies and gents, that's the end of the show. Thanks for watching.
But before ye go I'd like to leave you with a wee story
aboot how ma auntie lost her sight.
She was aboot eight years auld.
An' she was sneakin' aboot her maw's bedroom,
just tryin' on her makeup, and tryin' on her high heels, usual stuff that wee lassies dae.
An' she came across her maw's contact lenses.
Noo, back in they days, contact lenses were made o' glass.
Really dangerous to wear, especially for a wee lassie.
But ma auntie didnae know that.
So what she did was, she put this lens, this piece o' glass, on her eye.
A piece o' glass, it was the wrang size, wrang shape for her eyeball.
Then she blinked.
And what actually happened wis, and this is horrible...
What actually happened wis...
Look at ye.
You'd love to know, wouldn't ye?
You'd love to know.
Here's me aboot to tell ye how a wee lassie lost her sight efter puttin' a bit aw glass in her eye.
And there's you, perched on the edge of your seat, like that,
"Oh, yes, cannae wait to find oot what happens next.
"Do continue, please, do go on."
You know what the thing is an aw?
I just made it up. Just...
I don't know.
What's wrang wi' us?
End o' the show.
