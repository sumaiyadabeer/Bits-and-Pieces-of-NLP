Time to vote off the weakest link.
In an impressive first round,
Alex is the strongest link as he banked all the money for the team.
Statistically, the weakest link is Maggie, but how will the votes go?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Debbie.
Amy.
Wayne.
Farley.
Wayne.
Amy.
Slim.
Slim.
Slim.
What do you do, Shirley?
I'm a part time shop assistant, and I do karaoke as well.
  Where are you shop assistant?
  In Longniddry in East Lothian.
  Have you got any talents?
  I sing.
Can you sing professionally?
Well, when I went to Zambia, I ended up doing an album
and I think, for Zambians, it's quite professional
but I don't know how it would sound here. I don't think it's professional for here.
  Sorry, you've been a pop star in Zambia?
  Yes.
  And you were so successful
you've come back to be a shop assistant?
  Hmm.
  Just like Lulu, really.
  Yeah.
  What can you sing?
  DJ Sammy Heaven.
  I don't understand what you said, but just sing it.
I'm thinking about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free...
No tune to that, then(?)
Why Slim?
I had to vote somebody off and I think there's only room on the podium for one Scots person.
Is he Scottish?
Yes. I can tell by his skirt.
  What do you do, Wayne?
  I'm a scenes of crime officer, Anne.
  Are you the forensic part?
  Yes.
  Yeah.
So why aren't you in the white boiler suit?
It's a bit warm for those sort of outfits.
  So you never have the white boiler suit on?
  I try and avoid it, but sometimes it is necessary.
But in Midsomer Murders, they always have one of those white boiler suits on.
  It's not quite as glamorous in real life.
  When you get home in the white outfit,
  does your wife clean it for you?
  I don't have a wife, Anne.
  Ohh. What do you have at home, a budgerigar(?)
  A dog.
  A dog?
  And a husband.
  Oh, you've got a husband?
  So, does he wash your whites?
  Not at all. I do all that myself.
  And what else do you do?
  Um...
  You haven't made any pop records in Zambia, have you?
  No. I'm a bit of a karaoke singer myself but...
  Oh, are you?

  Oh, your voice is worse than Shirley's?
  Quite possibly, yes.
  What can you sing?
  Kingston Town by UB40.
  Can you? OK, then.
When I am king
Surely I will need a queen
And a palace and everything Oh oh.
  Is that it?
  It's about as good as it gets, I'm afraid.
  Why Slim?
  To be fair, I'm jealous of the beard.
  Where are you from, Farley?
  I'm from Bournemouth.
  Are you?
  Yes.
  What do you do in Bournemouth?
  I'm a door supervisor.
  Which door are you supervising?
Various different doors all over the place.
Do you take the doors with you, or do you find them there?
  No, I just stand in front of them.
  So you're a bouncer?
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  And are they clubs?
  Yes.
  Clubs in Bournemouth?
I work in a little town called Wimborne,
  just outside of Bournemouth.
  And that's got lots of clubs?
  It's got one.
  It's got one club.
  Yep.
  So you work on one door in one club in Wimborne?
  Yep.
  Yes.
Because it's Wimborne, you throw them in
  rather than throw them out?
  It happens more often than you'd think.
What are you checking for?
I'd check your ID. I have to ID anyone that looks under 25.
  Yes, so you'd need to check my ID?
  Absolutely.
If you had a large bag, maybe I'd ask you to open your bag
to see if you were trying to sneak in any alcohol.
Why would I bother if I can get it inside?
  It's cheaper, isn't it, from the shops.
  Oh, good tip. OK.
  Why Slim?
  He just seemed a little bit hesitant on his questions.
That's the only thing I can think of.
Slim, you are the weakest link, goodbye.

I think Farley has got quite a good chance of winning
