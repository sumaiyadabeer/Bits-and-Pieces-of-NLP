Here are nine contestants about to play for £10,000.
Only one of them will walk away with the money.
Eight of them will leave empty handed after they're voted the weakest link.
Welcome to The Weakest Link.
Any of the nine people here in the studio could win up to £10,000.
They don't know each other.
But to get the prize money, they have to work as a team.
But eight of them will get nothing,
voted the weakest link.
Let's meet the team.
I'm Daniel. I'm 30 and a solicitor from Bristol.
I'm Gary. I'm 41, a company director from Pontypridd, South Wales.
I'm Elaine. I'm 67. I'm from Doncaster and I'm retired.
I'm Denise. I'm 38.
I'm a consumer relations agent from York.
I'm Ben. I'm 21. I'm a student from Kingston.
I'm Karen. I'm 41.
I'm a clerical assistant from Leigh on Sea in Essex.
I'm Arthur. I'm 56.
I'm a part time lecturer from Tiverton in Devon.
I'm Justine. I'm 28.
I'm a housewife from Northampton.
I'm Paul. I'm 36. I'm an antique dealer from North London.
Now, the rules.
The aim is to answer enough questions correctly
to reach your £1000 target within the time limit. The fastest way
is to create a chain of nine answers. Get one wrong, you break the chain.
And you lose all the money. If you say "Bank",
the money is safe.
But you start a new chain from scratch.
Only money that has been banked
can be taken forward.
Round one lasts three minutes.
We'll start with the person who is first alphabetically
that's Arthur. Let's play The Weakest Link.

One of you gets nothing. Vote off the weakest link.
At this stage, the strongest link is Karen,
the only player to answer all her questions right.
Statistically, Justine and Denise are joint weakest links.
But who will lose in the vote?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Ben, why Justine?
  Are you questioning my judgement?
  Yep.
She wasn't particularly great.
  And you were particularly great?
  I thought I was good.
I'd certainly question your judgement.
Gary,
  why Justine?
  I know we didn't win much
  but I remember she lost us a lot when she didn't bank.
  Denise,
  how do you think you did?
  I could have done better. I'm nervous.
  That's not much use on a programme like this.
  No.
Well, you were statistically as bad as Justine. But it's votes that count.
Justine, with three votes,
you are the weakest link.
Goodbye.
When they show the cards and you see your name,
you do feel pretty bad.
It isn't very nice to see people voting you off.
One question I got wrong was the Tom Cruise film question.
I knew it was Interview With A Vampire. But I couldn't get the words out.
Round Two. Of the £1000 you could have won in that first round,
you put in the bank an embarrassingly low £170.
Eight of you left. Ten seconds off the clock.

Who should be sent packing?
One of you gets nothing. Vote off the weakest link.
The strongest link is Daniel who got all his questions correct.
The worst player is Elaine
who gave two incorrect answers and lost the team money.
Will the voting reflect the facts?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Daniel, your favourite hobby
  is barbecuing.
  One of them, Anne.
  That must be handy for general knowledge questions.
  Not really.
It seems to have held you in good stead. You were the strongest link.
Why Denise?
  I think she was the weakest link. Hard to keep track...
  She wasn't. You didn't keep track.
  Gary, why Denise?
  I thought she was very nervous.
I think she'll get even more nervous as things go on.
  You're not nervous?
  Absolutely petrified.
  Good.
Arthur, want to get rid of Denise, do you?
I think she's nervous. She said she was nervous in the first round. That's coming through.
Denise, your specialist subject is cinema?
I like cinema, yes.
  You don't know anything about it.
  I've been unfortunate.
By getting questions on the cinema, your speciality?
Just unfortunate with the choice of questions.
You were not statistically the worst player.
But with four votes, Denise,
you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I feel disappointed that I've been voted off,
seeing as I wasn't the weakest link in that round.
I wouldn't like to say who'll go next.
I feel that although Daniel started off very strong,
he seems to be getting nervous. He's getting more hesitant.
Round Three. You could have won £2000. You have in your kitty...
You're down to seven. We're taking ten seconds off.
We start with the strongest link Daniel.
Let's play The Weakest Link.

Who is buckling under the pressure?
It's time to vote off the weakest link.
The strongest link is Gary with four right answers.
The weakest link is Paul who lost the team money.
But will the other players have seen this?
Time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Gary, how do you think you did that round?
I think I did quite well.
  Why Paul?
  I remember the money was up quite high
when it got to him and he didn't bank.
Karen, how's it going for you?
Not bad.
Why Paul?
Again, the money. It sticks in the mind.
So, Paul,
you're saying hello to someone called Bab?
Hardly worth the bother. We're sending you home.
You WERE the worst player. You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I'm annoyed being voted out so early because I didn't bank.
I was trying to get us up to £1000, right to the top.
Elaine will go next. She's not too good on entertainment.
She's had a few hard questions.
Round Four. There's £950 banked so far
out of potential prize money of £3000.
Six of you left. Ten seconds off the clock.
You have 2½ minutes. We'll start with the strongest link Gary.

Whose lights need to be turned out?
Vote off the weakest link.
The strongest link is Arthur who banked £120 for the team.
The weakest link is Ben, who gave the most wrong answers.
But will the voting reflect reality?
It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Daniel, you can be quite stupid
about Shakespeare and still become a solicitor?
Yes, it's not a pre requisite.
Why Ben?
It was the Hanson question.
It was such an annoying song, he should have known it.
  He might be irritated with you for not knowing Shakespeare.
  Might be.
  Ben, where were you?
  I don't know where Daniel was.
I didn't answer the Hanson question.
Where were you in that round?
Miles away.
Exactly.
Why Daniel?
It wasn't a particularly good round.
  I felt he did as badly as me.
  He didn't. Nobody did as badly as you.
Arthur, why Daniel?
He IS a solicitor so I'm surprised he's lasted so long.
Let me give you some facts
to help you along.
As the strongest link, you have the choice of either Daniel or Ben.
You can change your mind.
In that last round, Ben statistically was the weakest link.
So, as the strongest link, Arthur, will you get rid of Ben or Daniel?
Ben's a student. He needs the money more.
  I'll say Daniel.
  Daniel, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I was a bit gutted, really.
That was the poorest round I'd had. But up to then, I'd done OK.
I was disappointed but I did badly in that round.
It was unlucky that Arthur had to make the decision.
He seemed to have a chip on his shoulder about solicitors.
He maybe doesn't know how much a criminal solicitor earns.
Round Five. Your total so far is...
If you'd hit your targets, it would be £4000. Five of you left.
Another ten seconds off the time.
We start with the strongest link Arthur.

In that round, you managed to put in your kitty only £100.
You could, of course, have had another £1000 in it.
Who should sling their hook? Who is too slow to stay?
Time to vote off the weakest link.
The strongest link is Arthur again, who gave three right answers
and banked money for the team.
The weakest link is Gary,
who lost the team the most money.
But will his team mates have worked this out?
It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Arthur,
why Elaine?
Elaine had a bad round. She's done well before but she had a bad round.
  Ben...
  Yes?
  Why Elaine?
  I felt she was weaker than I was.
Statistically, of course, she wasn't the worst player. Was she, Gary?
  No.
  You only got one question right.
  Why Elaine?
  We were as bad as each other. I can't vote for myself.
You weren't as bad as each other. You were worse than Elaine.
Well, she was the next worst to me.
Elaine,
what makes you think that Germany is a European city?
I don't know. I was confused. Sorry.
You don't have to be confused any longer.
You are the weakest link.
Goodbye.
I feel peeved because Gary was worse.
Although I will admit I felt the weakest link in earlier rounds.
I think Ben will be the next one to go
because he's the youngster of the group.
The others will pick on him a bit.
Round Six. So far, you've won £1240
out of a possible £5000. Four of you left.
We are cutting ten seconds off the time.

What a disastrous round for all of you.
You only answered five questions correctly.
And you banked just £90.
It'll be hard to decide but who should sling their hooks?
One of you will leave with nothing.
It's time to vote off the weakest link.
The strongest link is Karen with the least incorrect answers.
In a reversal of fortune, the weakest link is Arthur
who got all his questions wrong.
But will his previous success save him from the vote?
Time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Gary, why Arthur?
He didn't answer anything right.
  Do you remember YOU getting three questions incorrect?
  Only too well.
  Ben, why Arthur?
  Up to now,
he's been one of the strongest players, but he had a bad round.
  Arthur...
  Disaster.
This is a general knowledge game, not a home for the bewildered.
Why Gary?
I think Gary was probably not as bad as me but almost.
  No one was as bad as you.
  I know.
You didn't get a single question right.
The team have decided you are the weakest link.
Goodbye.
I'm very annoyed. I thought I was going to win
because I was the strongest link for three rounds and I was warming up.
But I wasn't. I was warming down.
Now I've gone, I think probably Gary will win it.
I hope Ben will win, even though he voted me off.
Round Seven. You have £1330 so far
out of a possible £6000. Three of you left.
Another ten seconds off the clock. We start with the strongest link Karen.
Let's play The Weakest Link.
Start the clock.

In that round, you banked a trifling £60.
You only answered six questions correctly.
Now, in Round Eight,
you treble what you bank.
So there is £3000 to be won.
The question is...
Who do you want to make an example of?
Who have you had enough of? Whose knowledge is not fit to remain?
It's time to vote off the weakest link.
For the first time in the game, the strongest link is Ben,
who banked the most money.
The weakest link statistically is Gary.
But at this crucial stage, will the voting follow the facts?
Time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Karen, how do you think you did?
Not very good at all.
  Disastrous.
  Yep.
Why Gary?
  I think he was on a par with me.
  Ben, why Gary?
I just didn't think he was up to the standard,
not that there was a particularly high standard.
Yes, I was going to say. What standard was that?
  Pathetically ineffectual.
  Gary...
  did you feel you were pathetically ineffectual?
  I was worse than that.
With two votes, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I think my lack of knowledge was exposed.
I can't believe I got the Alcatraz one wrong. I went there this year.
I think Karen will win. She started off shaky but she's got stronger.
Round Eight. So far, you've won...
You could, of course, have won £7000.
Ben and Karen, just the two of you left.
You have only 90 seconds. But whatever you win will be trebled and added to your total.
So £3000 is at stake in this round.
We'll start with the strongest link that's Ben.
Let's play The Weakest Link.
