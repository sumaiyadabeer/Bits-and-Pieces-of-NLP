Has an original point of view
  And I say, hey!
  Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day We can learn to work and play
And get along with each other
You gotta listen to your heart Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm of the street Open your eyes! Open your ears!
Get together, make things better By working together
It's a simple message And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself For that's the place to start
  And I say, hey!
  Hey!
  What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play And get along with each other
What a wonderful kind of day, hey! What a wonderful kind of day, HEY!
Hey, DW!
  Hey!
  Whoa!
OK, this is for the title.
Don't forget the sundae.
The winner gets a big pig at the Sugar Bowl with extra everything.
You're on!
On your mark, get set...
..Go!
Whoo hoo!
tree house, here I come!
Agh!
Did I do it? Who won?
Who cares? Look!
Oh! Our tree house!
..It was completely destroyed. Now it's just a big pile of wood.
But that's impossible. That treehouse has been around for years!
We've angered them.
We're sorry, aliens. Here, take our pie as a peace offering.
Aliens had nothing to do with it, Buster. It fell because of the snow.
  Where are we supposed to hang out now?
  My place!
  It's very conveniently located.
  Yeah, for you.
We can't go to someone's house!
The cool thing about the tree house was no one owned it.
  I have a 60" glass screen TV with 300 channels.
  I'm there.
Remember our first day in the tree house?
Sorry, Dora Winifred, this place is only for big kids.
Ah!
That was a good day.
Yeah, I'm sure gonna miss that place.
  So when are you gonna build a new one?
  New one?
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation.
It seems like you kids need another tree house.
  You don't understand, Mr...
  You can call me Frank. I'm an architect.
I've been hired to design the new art gallery in Elwood City, see?
That's going to be a building?
Well, it's just a preliminary sketch, but, sure, why not?
Who says a building has to look like a box?
Our tree house was kind of boxy,
but it was the best place to hang out in the world.
Who knows? If you put your heads together,
you might be able to dream up something even better.
Ask your parents to give me a call if you get any ideas. I could help you.
OK, how about this? A castle tree house.
Castles have been done before.
All right, how about a spaceship tree house?
  They've got something like that at the Chicken Lickin'.
  Fine,
  let's hear YOUR ideas.
  I don't have any yet.
I just think it should be something different, something new, like...
  ..like this!
  A mouldy crust of bread?
No, Arthur, a mouldy pizza crust.
  It's from the very first pizza my mom and I shared with Harry.
  So?
Don't you see? We could have a pizza tree house.
Shaped like a pie, the windows could look like pepperonis and...
'Wait, the windows could actually be pepperonis!
'If it's not raining, you could tear the windows off and eat them.
'And there'd be hot and cold running tomato sauce.
'And big comfy mozzarella chairs!'
Ah!
  That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard!
OK, maybe it can't actually be made of pizza,
  but it could be shaped like a pie.
  No way! It'll look really weird.
  I don't think so.
  I'm not taking a pizza tree house design to Frank.
Then maybe we should work on this alone.
It just doesn't make any sense. Who ever heard of a pie shaped house?
Hmm! Pie shaped.
  What are you writing?
  I'm collecting ideas that'll satisfy everyone.
So far, it's got to have an art gallery, an underground passage,
  and a wrestling arena.
  How will you fit an arena on top of a tree?
Details, details!
Hey, Brain, what would you like in the new tree house?
Oh, you don't have to bother designing anything   I've done it.
  What?
  Yes.
I ran into that architect and I've come up with a plan
  that will benefit the entire community.
  What is it?
Sorry, Arthur, I'm not at liberty to discuss the project.
Come to the unveiling on Saturday at the Sugar Bowl.
May I have some toothpicks, Mrs McGrady?
Thank you.
Huh?
That know it all! We'll see who has the best design.
I need the glue to dry faster!
Atchoo!
Agh hhh!
OK, we'll put Binky's arena here and Sue Ellen's pagoda there,
and George's woodworking shelf over to the left next to the sauna.
Oh, yeah, and it all has to be pie shaped.
Oh! I can't even see the tree any more.
Oh! This is pointless! There are just too many things to include.
Oof!
Huh?
That just might work.
Can we eat yet?
Just a minute, I want this drawing to really capture pizza.
There! What do you think?
It's very...
pizza ish.
Oh, it's too simple.
We should've ordered more toppings.
Arthur was right   a pizza tree house is a dumb idea.
Maybe I should work with calzones.
Whatever you do, it'll have to wait till after dinner. I'm starving.
Wait! Stop!
That's it! That's it! Don't move, mom!
I couldn't decide whether to do a spaceship or a castle,
so I combined the two. It's a space castle tree house.
I bet that hasn't been done before.
Actually, it reminds me of the work of Spanish architect Antonio Gaudi.
  It does?
  It's a compliment, Arthur.
Gaudi created some of the most amazing buildings of his generation.
  Look at his church of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.
  Awesome!
  That's amazing.
  What did you come up with, Buster?
I know it sounds kind of silly,
but, well, it's a pizza tree house.
At first, I imagined it as pie shaped,
but then I thought, "Why not separate the slices,
"and you could climb from slice to slice on ladders made of cheese?"
Cheese is not the best building material, Buster.
Oh! I guess the whole idea is pretty ridiculous.
No, it isn't.
I made a building once that looked like a pair of binoculars. See?
A great building can be inspired by anything.
The question is, can it be built?
I don't think one tree could support all that.
That's why I decided to use 10 trees.
I couldn't fit everyone's wishes into one design, so I spread it out.
That way, Binky can have his wrestling arena...
..Sue Ellen can have her art studio,
and so on and so on,
and they'd be linked by bridges, so we could visit each other.
Hee hee hee!
I like how you used the surrounding space,
but there's no place for you all to hang out together.
Isn't that the main purpose of your tree house?
There's room for the whole school in my design.
HE COUGHS Presenting...
the world's tallest tree house.
Hey, wait! That's not a tree house   it's built on the ground.
True, but it'll bring millions of tourists to Elwood City
and revitalise our sluggish economy.
It's a bold vision, Brain, but that would cost a fortune to build.
I know. I spent three months of allowance on the toothpicks alone.
Atchoo!
And I got a cold waiting for the glue to dry.
Your ideas are great, but I don't think you have your tree house yet.
That only leaves one option. We hang out at Muffy's.
Or you could go back to the drawing board and try working together.
Strong lines, a harmonious composition   I love it.
I knew you could come up with something new that you'd all like.
Actually, it's pretty much what we had before.
We just couldn't improve on the original design.
Find a design that reflects your vision   that's what you did.
And we built it ourselves.
How can you beat that? Here, it's a poster of something I designed.
If you're ever in Spain, you should check it out.
"To my friends in Elwood City, Frank Gehry."
That was Frank Gehry? I don't believe it!
He's one of the greatest architects of our time.
This is the museum he designed in Bilbao, Spain,
which people from all over the world travel to see.
Whoa! And you thought my pizza house was far out!
