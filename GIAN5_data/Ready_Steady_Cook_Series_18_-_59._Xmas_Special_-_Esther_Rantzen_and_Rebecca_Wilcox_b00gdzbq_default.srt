Hey! Hi, everybody! How are you? Thank you, brilliant!
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Christmas Ready Steady Cook!
Some great dishes coming your way, courtesy of our chefs!
Let's meet them, with our rather nice guests, yes, I'm excited!
Ladies and gentlemen, joining Paul Rankin in the Green Kitchen,
it's TV presenter, Esther Rantzen!
And joining chef Nick Nairn in the Red Kitchen we have her daughter,
the wonderful presenter, Rebecca Wilcox!
  Always a pleasure to see you.
  And you, Ainsley.
  Looking good!
I can't believe you presented, "That's Life", for over 20 years,
and you're still just doing it! You still look as vibrant
  and as gorgeous as ever!
  Isn't he gorgeous? Does he say that to you?
  He's a real charmer, he does flirt with me.
  Honestly!
I see you at your charity dos, you're always looking glam!
I've brought a little reminder of the show, cos a new generation
might have come along that couldn't remember "That's Life."
Go on, do your bit to the camera!
As this is a cookery programme, I thought we ought to do a special clip
which involved a cat called Mimi
and her loving mistress called Elsie.
The cat passed onto the great mouse pasture in the sky,
and Elsie decided to send her off for a bit of taxidermy,
or, as we say in the kitchen, for a bit of stuffing.
We asked Anne Green, club secretary for White Chinchillas,
to sum up their special quality. She said,
"They have outstandingly beautiful, deep emerald eyes.
"An expressive face, sweet and intelligent at the same time."
Which is not exactly how Mr Harvey
re created Mimi.
She arrived wrapped in this...
I'm letting the cat out of the bag!
Little Maxie is a boy and Mimi was a girl.
So there should be some kind of chemistry
even though Mimi is a little past it.
Maxie, this thing is a cat, Maxie!
Now let's just look... can you see any recognition?
Well, as a memorial, it certainly can't be compared with the Taj Mahal!
That's lovely!
Special, special memories!
And she became immortal, once seen, never forgotten!
That's one of thousands, isn't it? It was just one of those things,
  every Sunday night, the whole world seemed to tune in.
  Yes.
When I look at some of the programmes on air, "Britain's Got Talent",
things like that, I see little fragments of the performing dogs,
  talented children...
  Been there, done that, got the T Shirt!
And we've got the bag!
Let's have a look inside, Esther.
OK, what have you brought along for our chef today?
Mmm, lovely!
It's got to be a bit of turkey!
It's a bit of turkey, little bit of
nice, smelly cheese. I love Camembert.
  Lovely, yeah.
  Cranberries,
which is nice. I wanted Marsala, but I couldn't afford it, cos...
  Maderia's lovely!
  Do we like it?
Broccoli's good for the antioxidants.
And no show with me is complete without one of them,
  or one of those!
  Life's not complete without a good old root veg, eh?
How much did you spend, Esther? £7.49.
That's not too bad, allowed to spend up to £7.50
for the good old bistro bag, but Chef, what do you think?
Yeah, really terrific. I think we're going to divide the turkey
into two. I think with one we'll do a fairly traditional.
I love that!
Cranberry orange chutney, that sort of thing.
The other one we'll stuff with a bit of Camembert
  Right.
  The vegetables...I'd like to do a carrot and parsnip mash,
a traditional Northern Irish thing.
We have that on Christmas Day.
So you don't roast the parsnips around the turkey?
  No, but we might do that. We'll do some cream potatoes...
  No!
and then we'll do something exciting with the Camembert too.
They're debating it.
Let's hear it for Esther and Paul. Thank you!
Hello, how are you? Mmm, as gorgeous as your mum!
I tell you! "How To Look Good Naked",
but how good are you in the kitchen?
Um, better than I am naked!
  Are you really?
  That's for sure!
You disappoint me! Are you quite good?
Do you get out there and express yourself,
or do you have to open up a recipe book and go through each detail?
I would love to say I was good, but I actually think I'm pretty bad!
You're going to be fantastic!
  I do well when I'm told what to do! So...
  Look, now we're talking!
Go on, give it a bit of a shake!
let's have a look at what we've got here. Talk to us about this lot.
These are my 'favouritist' things in the world, but I can't cook them.
Also, this I really don't know what to do with, but it tastes very nice.
Scallops, a nice bit of butternut squash there, OK.
  Almonds, and er...
  Oyster mushrooms, bit of pak choi,
and you like chilli?
  I love spicy food, but I've had a chilli squirt in my eye...
  We have to be careful.
  ..which really hurt!
  What about coriander? No, not your thing!
  Don't you like coriander?
  No!
  This is all crying out for coriander.
  It's such a shame!
  Convert me!
  Or basil and mint?
Maybe work well with that Asian vibe.
I get things stuck in my teeth, which is a problem.
  How much did you spend?
  Seven pounds 53,
nearly three pounds over?
Three pound over would be lovely, would be a gourmet bag.
A great, great bag! What do you think, Chef?
Fantastic bag, I love scallops,
one of my favourite things.
They'll go really well with the Asian style. The pak choi,
the oyster mushrooms, the chilli,
nice little sort of soy honey dressing thing.
We'll roast the butternut squash.
and make some into a soup. Some of it, we'll do something very creative
with, it'll come to me in a minute!
The almonds, again we'll do something very creative with,
something very imprecise here,
because I'm making it up!
  I like it!
  It'll develop...
  As we go!
Could be a pudding, I've seen him do puddings with butternut squash.
Ladies and gentlemen, Rebecca and Nick!
OK, ladies and gentlemen! Great food coming your way, courtesy of these guys.
When I say... ready, steady, let's cook!
  Incredibly Christmassy!
  How nice is that?
  How Christmassy are you, darlin'?
  Thank you.
  You look pretty good.
I love that, that's really Christmassy, the red and green?
  Brilliant. Well done, Esther!
  Thank you.
  Where are you going, Esther?
  I'm just examaning what is available to us.
  Didn't you say you were going to mash something?
  Oh, yeah.
  We're going to do that Irish carrot, parsnip, mash type thing.
  Mmm!
Which is really lovely, and it's part of a tradition in our house.
Have you got lots of kitchen utensils at home, and stuff?
  Is it possible to peel that one also?
  You see,
I'm left handed, so I normally delegate this sort of chore.
  Right, then.
  Two things I'm not good at...three things!
Milking a cow, knitting and peeling things.
I always say it's cos I'm...
  'Nobody saw it, no!'
  What did you do, Nick?
  'Nothing!'
  'Nothing!'
Just my squash exploded, and a bit disappeared over there.
  But I brought it back and wiped it.
  All right, then.
Follows the ten second rule, Nick, if it's not on the floor
  for more than ten seconds...
  It's five!
  ..you'll have to use it!
Oh, brilliant!
  What are we going to do?
  We're going to cut some nice escalopes.
Turkey suits this kind of thing, you know?
  Escalopes...
  Do you have to stroke it?
Did you stroke it lovingly?
  Which?
  The turkey.
Did you not see me? Like this, I did stroke it!
I was kinda like that cat thing that you had there.
So stroke the turkey...
Hello, do you recognise him? Kinda the same, you know!
  Um...
  Yes?
You just draw it through.
  'And dropped it!'
  Nice!
And, like the cat, you going to stuff this, then?
Yes, like the cat, we're going to stuff it!
  Yes, lovely!
  That's what I was getting at!
We're going to stuff it with sage and Camembert.
A little bit of Camembert might leak out here, but that's quite nice.
  You know, that cheesy stuff that leaks out into the pan...
  Mmm!
  And goes all gooey!
  Very nice indeed.
Do you do much cooking at home at Christmas, Esther,
  or all year round?
  Well, to be honest,
I'm more the pierce film and place in microwave
school of cookery.
You see, I live, not entirely, on my own, but my kids,
that one over there, has gone off in a flat by herself,
so I don't cook for anyone but me and it's boring cooking for yourself.
Except at Christmas time when you cook for everybody.
Then its gets more elaborate. Do you also celebrate Hanukkah?
If it's possible to celebrate anything, I will.
I will celebrate everything simultaneously.
If the opportunity presents itself, do it!
  Let's have a party!
  You're my type of girl, Esther, that's what I like!
  Stockings, light the candle!
  Mmm!
  I did have a catastrophe one Christmas.
  What happened?
The family came around and I decided I would cook.
I was doing the Christmas pudding, got all the way to there, no problem,
not a hitch. Rushed to the fridge,
a little bit of drink taken, took the delicious white concoction
in it's glass bowl, spread it over the pudding...
it was mayonnaise!
Did you wash it off, and get on with it?
My mother, who was adorable, and had lots of drink taken,
  and was about 85 at the time, ate the lot!
  There you go!
  There's always someone to eat it, isn't there?
  Very nice story.
OK, Chef, what are you doing?
  You've stuffed that just with cheese?
  With cheese and sage.
We're after a little bit of that Christmassy feel going on.
  Lovely!
  I'm just going to put a bit of foil around it, just in case
it wants to open. As meat starts to cook, what it might do
it sorta wants to change.
It takes a bit of energy.
  I'm just gonna...
  It's a Christmas present!
  You're gift wrapping it.
  Ok, yeah.
  Sorry, didn't mean to point the parsnip!
  Don't point parsnips at me!
They're getting on famously(!) Let's see how Nick and Rebecca are getting on down here.
Don't forget we've got scallops this end, lots of juicy scallops!
  Hasn't started happening yet!
  All getting a bit...
  Wow!
  I'm doing things!
  You are!
  We're gonna roast some squash
with garlic and some rosemary.
  I'm getting burnt!
  Just toasting these almonds
to make an almond cream to go in the soup.
  The soup is a classic.
Butter, bit of onion, bit of garlic.
Vegetarian, vegetable stock cube going in there,
for those of vegetarian persuasion,
and a little bit of boiling water.
We'll simmer that for 15 minutes,
and then liquidise it very quickly,
and serve it with the almond cream. Keep stirring, or it will burn.
Are you caramelising this, to get a bit brown?
I want that lovely, crispy thing, you know, fry just until crispy.
  Wow!
  Just a classic little
stir fry in there, and then we chuck in some of these oyster mushrooms.
Mum was saying she's a bit of a microwave queen and that
you've moved out of home.
  Yes.
  Are you a ready made meals girl, or trying to be more creative?
I used to be addicted to ready meals.
All I could do was pierce and toast, in terms of the kitchen.
But now I try and do stir fries and stews, and stuff.
  You don't try, you're doing it!
  I'm doing it!
  Doing it beautifully!
Are you more more organic now?
Are you more aware of the type of food that you buy?
I'm conscious of what goes into food.
I've done a documentary about it, the types of meat you can get.
I try and eat pescetarian, cos I'm worried about it.
Pescetarian's very trendy these days,
isn't it? I'm very trendy, and very sweaty as well.
And you also call yourself a beauty junkie, where does that come from?
I've always been a cosmetic addict, I have drawers and drawers...
That comes from Mum bringing home wonderful things from the TV?
She had some lovely stuff, and it's mainly gone into my handbag!
Did you hear that, Mum?
You wondered what happened to that lipstick...
  Yeah, what happened?
  Becs has got it here!
It looks so good on her, what can I do?
  Aah!
  Don't get the sympathy vote!
  Competitive mother and daughter!
  She knows she's gorgeous!
  Why did you go into TV?
I think it's in the genes!
Like doctors give birth to doctors, and lawyers to lawyers, she gave birth to a toothy presenter!
They made it look fun, Mum and Dad, and I always wanted to do it.
I started behind the camera, had the chance to leap in front and I did!
Remind us again who Dad was?
Dad was the amazing Desmond Wilcox,
who made many BAFTA winning documentaries.
  Dearly departed, of course.
  Lovely!
  And you just miss him, don't you?
  I miss him. It's the onions!
  I know, I miss my mum.
  Ooh!
  Especially at Christmas time, yeah!
It's interesting when you talk about people who have parents who perform,
cos my dad was an entertainer, a professional pianist...
  What happened to YOU?
  It's great, he's still alive!
  Don't say that!
He'll take the huff!
I'll tell you! Nick, were your parent chefs, anything like that?
My father was an actor, and my mum was an artist.
God knows what happened to me!
I think you're great!
  Scallops, mate.
  Loving them, loving them!
These are hand dived scallops.
There are two types of scallop, the most common one,
95% of the scallops we eat are dredged.
Dredging's bad as it binds them together, cracks them,
fills them with sand, suffocates, and can kill them.
It's also bad for the seabed as well.
Environmentally very poor. About 5% of them, the diver
swims down, picks one up and puts it in a sack.
To open them use a sharp knife and just scrape it down,
the two shells, curved shell, flat shell,
down the flat side, OK? Open them up,
  pull that...
  Looks disgusting!
  Delicious, delicious! Open them up,
and take the flat shell off.
Then use a spoon next, that's my best tip for this.
The spoon mimics the shape of the shell.
There's a bit of connective tissue here. Can you see it?
That does the opening and closing thing. That's the muscle.
This is the bit we want, the meat, down here you've got the little roe,
and that black bit is the stomach.
  We don't burst that, full of black goo.
With the spoon underneath, out it comes. Now, watch this.
You see, this is the whole secret.
You can see this little line here
between there...and there... which are two different muscles.
Just put your finger through.
  It's like a little handbag?
  That's the worst handbag I've ever seen!
Fingers and thumbs here, push up
from underneath, push down with your thumbs.
This bit comes out nice and cleanly.
Like so! Very, very simple!
Would you like to have a go?
  Come on, Becs!
  But it looks like, feels like, snot!
Just past halfway now, guys!
Put your fingers on there,
  two thumbs on the top.
  Errgh!
Push up underneath with your fingers, put this thumb over...
  This thumb over?
  Push up with your fingers...yeah, look at that!
  Round of applause!
When we come back, we're going to find out exactly what Nick is doing with his scallops.
  Thanks for that, Chef.
  Pleasure!
  A master class in opening scallops.
Always a very good tip, you can buy them fresh at your fishmonger
and it does taste different from the frozen variety in the bag. Chef!
  Tell us what you're doing here.
  Merry Christmas!
  And to you!
Not quite a rosti? How are you preparing this?
No, it's rosti, absolutely!
We've taken the potatoes Esther grated for me, beautifully,
into a pan with a little bit of oil, but what you want
is to see the fat, or batter,
ticking over around the edges when you're doing a rosti.
  I like to put a bit of butter...
  Eight minutes to go, eight!
Goodness! We've got to get the souffle started.
We're going to put it in late
because by the time we get the tasting ready...it needs to sit.
What do you want, Chef? Egg whites, egg yolks?
  I would like... Two yolks, two whites.
  OK, lovely.
Just break these up,
we've got whites in there. You ready for doing a little bit of beating?
  Yes, yes.
  All right, that will happen very soon.
Not usually game for a bit of beating, not my taste!
I know! But there's always a way around things, isn't there?
  I'm sure there is!
  Ha ha!
Lovely! What do you think made That's Life such a success?
It was the first, well, reality show.
It was the first interactive reality show. Everything we did was based on
viewers' letters, viewers' jokes, viewers' pets, as you saw.
  It was hilarious.
  It was hilarious.
Do you know what I like about this kitchen?
I like there's a woman with a glass of wine,
and there's two men doing the work!
That's the way every kitchen should be!
  She's a true alpha female, isn't she?
  That's brilliant!
Do you want us to...
  Strip off?
  ..Wear less, and just have the aprons?
Yeah, we could do that! And lie under the Christmas tree!
Five minutes to go, guys, less than...!
  Perfect!
  Oh, what's he doing with the Camembert?
This is all coming together. What about this egg white,
what do you want with this?
Fine just the way it is, Ainsley,
  it's absolutely fine.
  Esther, hang on!
  Ooh! Nearly lost the sauce, there we are,
  I shouldn't be allowed to touch anything...
  Don't be silly,
  you're doing fine.
  ..with a glass of wine in my hand.
It's Christmas, my love.
Larger bowl, Chef? Here we are. What about your charity work?
You've been dedicated to "ChildLine", which you set up,
  for many years. Are you still involved in that?
  Absolutely.
Listen to children on the phone,
telling really tragic stories. The most recent shift I was on,
there was a young volunteer counsellor who was talking to a kid
who was standing on the parapet over a motorway
wanting to jump, but, at the last moment,
she made a phone call to us. 0800 11 11.
Christmas is a tough time for some children.
  Absolutely, and families.
  And families.
They think every other child in the world is happy except them.
But ChildLine is there, counsellors are there,
for any child that feels unhappy,
lonely, isolated, miserable, frightened,
  ring that number and talk to us.
  Someone's going to be at the end of that phone.
Absolutely, and it's amazing when you talk about a problem it does actually
help you take one step towards solving it.
  Starting to deal with it.
  Absolutely.
Round of applause, ladies and gentlemen! Fantastic!
  Brilliant!
Time, dedication, and speaking of time, three minutes to go.
Will Paul be able to create his souffle in three minutes?
  Not in three minutes!
  I don't think so!
  You don't take them out
  when we say. Because by the time you taste them, they will drop.
So you have to put them in late.
God, that's so brilliant! He is amazing.
  Lovely!
  Cranberries sizzling away...
Let's go to the other side, see how the chef's getting on.
He's finishing off the turkey escalopes. Turkey escalopes, and scallops down this end!
Barbecues, we're done with that. Look at the tempura...
  I made tempura!
  Wow!
There you go! Fantastic! Here we are, look at this!
Didn't she do well with her tempura?
Very, very nice indeed!
Cook the scallop on one side only,
so we've got them not overcooked.
That's really important.
Season them now, a bit of salt and pepper, bit of lemon juice.
What are you steaming, Chef,
  in the bamboo over there?
  Have a look, two delicious looking
scallops in the shell with sesame,
soy, and honey. It's a delicious combination,
  incredibly healthy as well.
  You've got two minutes to go.
Do you need that soup whipped up?
we need that soup liquidised. The hand blender is on the other side.
  A blender?
  That's cream for the soup.
Here we are, straight into there, in we go.
The almond cream is toasted almonds and double cream.
  Oh, look!
  All of that is blitzing around there.
  If I put that there, can you manage?
  I can do that.
Go on, then! Hold that bit there.
The chef will get you going. One and a half minutes to go now.
Everything has to start coming together.
We've got steamed scallops, tempura.
We've got escalopes and souffles
going on down there, cheese wrapped
in beautiful turkey, all sorts of things.
Will the chefs get it on the plate in time?
I don't know, could be very interesting let's see it unfold!
  Put it in the oven now...
  One minute to go!
  Yes, yes!
  How's that coming on?
OK, let's get it out.
It is very quick, yep!
It's happening to this mash!
Coming up for the 40 second mark,
Very good salad is here...
I'll disguise it as something else.
30 seconds now, 30 seconds!
Bring a bowl for me, it's done, it's beautiful, fantastic!
20 seconds! Audience, get ready to help me countdown.
Will the chefs get it out?
Ten...
nine...
eight...
seven...
six...
five...
four...
three...
two...
one...
Stop...cooking!
I thought they'd never get there! Let's check out today's menu!
In the Green Kitchen, Paul and Esther have come up with
turkey roulade stuffed with herbs and Camembert
with Esther's rusticcarrot and parsnip mash and cranberry sauce.
Turkey escalopes with cranberry red wine sauce and roasted vegetables.
A beautiful rosemary potato rosti,
and finally Cambembert, cranberry and sage souffle.
In the Red Kitchen, Nick and Rebecca have produced
butternut squash soup with roasted almond cream.
Steamed scallops with sesame soy and chilli,
scallops with Asian style mushrooms,
roasted squash with chilli salad,
and finally, Rebecca's tempura vegetables with fresh chilli chips.
OK, come on, let's go and have a bit of a taste, shall we?
  Look at this!
  Da da!
Timing's spot on!
Are you happy, overall? Presentation wise?
Presntation wise, it's beautiful!
If I'd had another 30 seconds...
Mmm...!
This is the genius thing for me, because who can make a souffle so that it's
at perfection the moment you need it?
You try it.
That is crucial, cos if you put it in too early
when it's ready, it doesn't really hold it.
If you have to hold it you have to switch your oven off and open the oven door slightly.
  I like this sort of combination,
this cheese and cranberry thing. It works quite well, especially with a little sugar,
a little sage, maybe chives and onion would also have worked in there...
No, don't tamper with perfection. That is divine.
There you go. Try something else. Go on.
  Who's gonna eat the souffle?
  There'll be plenty of time for that.
That's the little escalope I pounded out   a little salt and pepper,
then in went little bits of cranberry, parsley,
again there's sage in that.
The chutney we make with red wine, sugar, orange juice and orange zest.
You were doing that with eight arms all over the place!
  Perhaps it was the wine again.
  Wonderful!
That's another one. You've got roasted vegetables there.
  This is altogether a little more simple.
  Mm hm.
If you didn't... Turkey is great for flash frying.
  Mm hm.
  You get those nice big breasts...
  And you flash it.
  Yeah.
As you would.
I think, ladies and gentlemen, she's enjoying every mouthful. Let's hear it for Esther and Paul.
  What is your mum like?
  I know! Try growing up with her.
  I tell you what!
Very, very lovely. OK. It's Rebecca's turn now.
She's in for a bit of a scallop feast here.
  A gastronomic treat!
  Yeah!
  A quick touch of the old soup...
  I think we'll start here.
  Steamed scallops. We took them out of the shell, cut them in half, put them back in again...
  Nice.
Soy, honey, sesame seeds, sesame oil, lemon zest, lemon juice,
  steam them, 3 minutes, and the result is?
  Mmm!
  Mm!
  Which is good.
  Go on, straight into that one.
A stir fry here. Onions, garlic, chilli,
  pak choi, mushrooms...
  That's amazing.
  Really good.
  Try... Oh, you have.
  This is all Rebecca's own work.
  I know.
She made the batter with self  raising flour,
ice cold sparkling mineral water, plenty seasoning, a lot of chilli,
and we've got vegetables in here   the pak choi, the stems, herbs,
  oyster mushrooms, and we also have rows of scallops.
  It's so good.
It's so light and delicious and yummy.
If you want any of these recipes, please check them on our website.
  The soup.
  Go on, then.
Roast butternut squash. Look at the colour of it.
Lovely toasted almond cream to go with it.
I want to bathe in it, it's so good!
I've got to say I'd join you, Rebecca, and so would you, Nick!
Ladies and gentlemen   Nick and Rebecca.
Well, it is Christmas, isn't it?
OK, who are the studio audience going to be voting for today?
Will it be a Green Kitchen win with Esther and Paul,
or a Red with Rebecca and Nick?
The choice is theirs. Please pick up your keypads and all vote now.
Are you in the mood for beautiful scallops cooked many different ways,
or tender succulent turkey   maybe even that souffle? I have no idea.
OK, computer. Sort this out. Who has won today's 20 minute challenge?
You can see it's a Red Kitchen win!
Come over here now.
Winner!
  Ah!
  What can I say?
  Well done to lovely Rebecca. There you go.
  I won!
  I know!
You can put it with all the other mums' awards she's got at home.
  This is yours now though, isn't it?
  This is mine. It's all about me.
  Your mother made you that way. She's a winner too.
  It's her fault that I'm this monster.
Absolutely.
And obviously we'd like to make a donation towards your favourite charity, which is?
  It's got to be ChildLine.
  I thought it would be.
Thank you. Happy Christmas.
  Thank you.
  Well done, Chef.
  Always a pleasure!
  And our lovely Esther.
Now, my love...
  You've got your glass of wine.
  Yes.
  When you've finished that and you fancy a cup of tea,
you'll have to use your Ready, Steady, Cook mug!
How lovely is that?
  Thank you.
  It goes with your apron.
  So it does!
  Well done.
  My pleasure.
More food coming your way, courtesy of our chefs and the Quickie Bag challenge.
Let's say a very big thank you to the gorgeous Esther Rantzen and her daughter Rebecca Wilcox.
  Well done.
  Thank you.
OK! Let's meet today's Quickie Bag challenger.
  We're joined today by Christine Tilbury. Hello, Christine.
  Hi.
  Welcome.
You run the Cordon Vert Cookery School at the Vegetarian Society.
  Yes.
  Tell us a little about the Cordon Vert Cookery School.
It is the culinary school of the Vegetarian Society.
We train chefs to produce imaginative and wonderful cuisine.
Why is that so important now?
There's a lot of vegetarians in the UK and a lot of chefs have no real grounding in vegetarian cuisine.
  It used to be omelettes everywhere you went.
  It still can be.
  Really?
  Mm hm.
  I didn't realise that. When I go to restaurants, I sometimes go for the vegetarian option,
cos it's so interesting now. You're training people to come up with wonderful ideas.
  What would you prepare for a vegetarian Christmas dinner?
  It changes every year.
  One of my favourites is a chestnut pate...
  Mm hm.
..and in the middle it's laid with fresh figs and a lemon zest with pine nuts
and I'm gonna wrap it all in filo pastry
and tie it up with a leek ribbon and serve it with a cardamon, red wine reduction.
  You've got some ingredients there.
  I have.
  Thank you.
  Miss Tilbury, will you come along and have a wee taste afterwards?
  I'd love to.
  Yeah!
  From the Cordon Vert Cookery School, thank you!
  Thank you.
  Gentlemen are you in the mood for...?
  Always in the mood, Ains!
  Yeah?
  There we are.
  Wooh!
  We have a wonderful selection today.
I thought Christine gave some lovely tips about what to do for Christmas
  and you've got filo pastry in here too, so, guys, get your thinking caps on...
  Mm.
And pine nuts, figs, feta cheese, filo pastry, peppers, tomatoes and a large bag of watercress.
What would you do with this little lot? We're about to find out. First up, Paul Rankin.
My big thing with filo in the Quickie Bag
is to bake to filo separately,
  a little sugar, a little butter...
  It's brilliant. I've nicked it loads of times.
One of those I would do with Feta, figs, honey and pine nuts.
The other one I would do with caramelised onions, roast tomatoes, balsamic vinegar.
And I think it's possible to make a ten minute watercress soup.
Nice, bright, green and fresh. We'd probably garnish that with some roasted yellow pepper.
There you go. Very nice choice.
Green button for this man, but you might want to press your red after this description.
There's a lovely fig tart in here.
You could caramelise the figs in butter and sugar
and then do a scrunched up filo thing   paint the filo
with butter, sprinkle with brown sugar and bake in the oven.
There is a lovely stuffed pepper,
with a pesto style stuffing with feta, pine nuts and watercress.
  Then there are parcel things...
  Parcel things?
  You know you always wrap things up in filo?
  Yeah.
And one always wants to get a parcel at Christmas time.
  Absolutely.
  It will probably be tomatoes in there.
  Mmm.
  And feta cheese.
  Yeah.
  But there'd be a hat.
We could make... No, no, let's make a...
  ..Filo Christmas cracker!
  Oh! They're getting silly now!
  No!
  Christmas cracker? I like the idea of that!
OK, Red or Green, the choice is yours. Please pick up your keypads and vote now.
Let's see which way they're gonna go. So far they're impressed fairly equally. Even Stevens here.
The reds are coming back a little stronger.
OK, computer, sort this out. Who has won today's 10 minute Quickie challenge?
By one it's a Red Kitchen Nick Nairn win.
OK, Chef, your ten minute cooking time starts now.
Could you make me a watercress paste? half of this, half of that, half of that.
  Garlic?
  And garlic. In your spare time, that lovely soup you promised us?
  Ains, can you unwrap the filo and start buttering it up?
  Certainly.
  On there.
Melted butter...
Half of it I'm gonna do with caster sugar for the top of the figs.
I'll get the figs on.
Pan on there for the figs. We're gonna make a little caramel. We'll need some butter for that.
  Um... Butter, butter...
  Lovely. What's he gonna get you to do?
  The pesto and the soup.
  You're taking your time. You're being very slow!
You're gonna land me in the poo!
  Come on!
  Come on, Mr Rankin!
  Get enthusiastic!
  I love being able to relax when cooking.
  You're dawdling. Come on.
  Do you know how many Goody Bags I've done this season?
  I know,
but this is the most important   you and I together. We don't get to do this very often.
  We'll make it extra special for my mate!
  Come on!
Prove we're mates by beautiful cooking and fast cooking
and concentrated cooking.
When do I never do that? I always concentrate.
You were wandering about looking in a daze.
That's my vibe!
I think these boys have been for a few Christmas spirits. They're having a moan.
Are two layers enough? Guys, I'm just buttering up the filo pastry here,
so that's going to make it lovely and crisp...
We're gonna stuff that with chopped up tomatoes and some watercress.
  I'll put one more layer on, then.
  That's a bowl for the tomatoes
  It doesn't matter which way it comes out here.
  That can be crumbly.
  One of the dangers...
  We're gonna crunch a lot of that up...
One of the dangers of cooking at Christmas
is you tend to have a glass of port or sherry or wine or something.
I'll put the onion on for you, cos... Oh you've taken it out.
  Have you got the onion there?
  Onion where?
  Onion...
  You want onion in the pesto?
  Eh...
Wine would be absolutely fantastic! There we are!
Why don't you just pour some wine and be useful?
  Come on. You're not doing much else.
  We've got eight minutes to go.
We're gonna put the figs in, Ains. A mixture of butter, sugar and they'll caramelise up beautifully.
Then we're going to scrumple up some filo and pop that on top, like so,
  and pop the whole thing in the oven.
  So, the filo on the top,
I'll take some here, and you can be quite messy with this.
  What do want here? Basil, fresh thyme?
  Yes, basil,
some feta, a few pine nuts.
  Seasoned up...
  Paul, have you got the feta?
  He has.
  There we go.
  Thank you.
  Shall I toast some pine nuts?
Don't bother, cos you just burn them.
I used to try that, but every time I did they burnt.
Who put the butter in here?
I put the butter in to put pressure on you   if you don't get the onion in soon
the butter's gonna burn.
Listen, I am so in control here.
  Yeah, yeah, right.
  I put very little onion in my watercress soup.
Is that because you can't be bothered, or is that part of the recipe?
No, in the three star Michelin Gavroche,
where I worked for three years, we didn't put any onion in our water cress soup whatsoever.
  Potato?
  We put potato, water and watercress and that was it.
Was it you I nicked the idea off  
of putting a little spinach in at the end when you liquidise it to give it colour?
  No, that was Phil.
  You're not gonna get a great crunch off that.
  I filled that a little too much.
  What about some sesame seeds on the outside?
No problem at all.
We're looking nice now, with the tart. The figs are starting to caramelise,
and when we pop it in the oven the filo cooks incredibly quickly.
The sugar in the filo starts to turn to carbon...
  A little spiced paprika on that.
  That'll be nice, Ainsley.
  Lovely.
And then we'll pop the whole thing in the oven.
  Six minutes to go.
  Fantastic.
  Lovely. OK.
  So the watercress soup is coming on...
  Six minutes to go.
That will be enough time for that lovely cracker, ladies and gentlemen.
  I've got to get my stuffed pepper in.
  Lovely.
  How's that pesto?
  Pesto's done.
  OK. Could I have the pesto, please?
  You may have the pesto.
What about the remainder of the tomatoes?
A couple of tomatoes in here, at the bottom   they melt down into the peppers which is very nice.
We'll get a pan to put that on there...or a tray or something.
Those pine nuts are toasting, Paul. I don't know what you're gonna do with them.
Your watercress is cooking away nicely
  and I need to put some of the pesto into... If I had a spoon...
  Just a couple into the bottom.
  OK. There you go.
  I might do a little salad cos there's a bit left over.
  All right.
Put the tomatoes there. I'll leave the stalks on some of them, too.
  That's quite pretty.
  The pesto should form a nice crust over the top of this.
The cheese in the pesto starts to caramelise nicely.
We could use that pesto to make a dressing for the salad, so we've got a fig and tomato...
  Any feta left? Toasted pine nuts.
  There should be lots of feta left.
Give me a cloth please, cos we don't have enough room. Thank you.
  Does this thing work?
  What thing?
  This thing.
  There's a robo cube there if you want.
It doesn't work very well for doing soup.
You want a hand blender, Paul.
  This'll work.
  We do have a Quickie Question, today.
And it's appropriate, because it's Christmas time, that we get the children involved.
Please welcome Adam Geest. Adam, all the way from Bishop's Stortford.
  How are you doing?
  Good.
  Yeah. Do you want to be a chef when you grow up?
  Yeah.
  Yeah. That would be quite exciting
and I bet your mum's going to be delighted. Is that right?
  If he could cook like you, yeah!
  Oh! What would you like to ask our chefs?
  Normally I only use egg whites at home...
  To make meringues and things?
  Yeah.
But I always have left over egg yolks and we have to chuck them out because we don't know what to with them.
So, what could I do with them?
There you go. Egg yolks.
Hollandaise. Hollandaise sauce.
Custard. Do you like custard?
Quick recipes for hollandaise sauce and custard, boys.
Three egg yolks in the blender, tablespoon of lemon juice, tablespoon of boiling water,
melt butter until it's almost boiling, start the liquidiser and pour the butter on.
Delicious hollandaise. The butter has to be really hot so it cooks the yolks
  and the hollandaise ends up nice and thick.
  Don't pour the butter all at once?
  Just a steady stream.
  A steady stream.
  Season it up. A little salt and a little cayenne pepper really brings the flavour out.
Paul, creme anglaise?
Three egg yolks, three tablespoons of sugar, whisk it together,
about 250 ml of milk, a little vanilla essence,
boil your hot milk,
add it to your egg yolks, put it back in the pan and stir it just until it thickens  
not until it scrambles.
  They're talking about coating the back of the spoon. Know what I mean?
  Yes.
You don't want thick globby custard like Mummy makes!
  Does Mummy make thick, globby custard?
  No.
  How's her custard?
  Smooth?
  Yeah.
  Smooth and gorgeous! Make sure she helps you when you
when you do all those things as you're dealing with hot butter and hot milk.
Give him a round of applause! All right.
  82 degrees centigrade.
  What's that?
  82 degrees centigrade for the custard. That's the point that it just starts to thicken up.
We'll make a nice salad here   the tomatoes, the figs, some parsley,
we'll put a little onion in as well, finely sliced onion.
OK. We've got a couple of minutes to go. Is he making the dressing
  or do you want a pesto dressing?
  Could you turn that into a dressing?
  Certainly.
  I'm going to add a little finely chopped onion.
  I think you've got the whisking stuff there. You're OK?
  Something's burning.
What about your top shelf, Nick? Filo pastry.
I'm going to check it in two secs, but I think it was the pine nuts.
  I'm sure that's a little bit brown there.
  The Christmas cracker is looking cracking.
So, Ains, if you could dress the salad and serve it, that would be great.
  Paul, how are you doing with that soup?
  It's ready.
Bowl over there. We've got the toasted pine nuts to go in the salad.
In they go there. How much longer have we got?
Literally about a minute and a half.
Have you got any glasses?
  Mm hm.
  I like...
  We've got martini glasses. That'll do.
That's the lovely thing about watercress soup   it's that intensity.
  A glass of martini.
  Thank you.
Shaken not stirred. Not stirred, not shaken.
  OK. We've got one minute left.
  For you, darling.
  Is it OK if I drizzle a little cream on the soup?
  Yes, please.
  Could you dress the salad please, Ains?
  Yeah.
  Are the pine nuts in?
  Yeah.
  I don't put all of it in. Just literally coating...
  Look at that!
  Mmm.
  Is that not delicious?
That is less than ten minutes to make that tart.
  OK. 40 seconds to go.
  We've got Ainsley's Christmas cracker.
  Let's get this here. A little dressing for this, maybe. Ooh!
  Lovely.
  A Christmas cracker.
  A little salad next to that.
There we are, Chef.
There we are. Mm hm.
  Yeah, just a little bit on the side.
  Can I steal some of those pine nuts back?
  Yeah.
Blowlamp. The thing's not toasted up properly. Is the blowlamp there?
No. Doesn't matter.
Oh yeah. Can you get that going?
  Ten, nine, eight...
  What are we doing?
  ..seven, six, five, four...
  Glaze.
  This?
  Yes.
  ..three, two, one, stop cooking!
  Oh!
  Ting!
  Welcome back Christine from the Cordon Vert cookery school.
  How are you?
  Fine, thank you.
  You gave us our bag full of ingredients.
You are used to preparing vegetarian food. What do you think of these efforts here?
  It looks colourful, it looks fresh. There's plenty of texture there.
  What about the taste?
  I should open cookery school!
  Get out!
  What would you like to try?
  I think I'm going to try this...
  Christmas cracker.
  Yeah.
  Shall we pull it?
  A lovely little bit of cracker.
  The cheese is inside there.
  Mmm.
We stuffed that with cheese, tomato   it would be nice with a bit of that fig salad.
If you're doing something like that,
the stuffing needs to be something which doesn't need to be cooked.
If you're putting mince or chicken in, you'd need to bake it for much longer.
  Thank you. Mm.
  There we are.
  The moment of truth. We've got soup. How does that taste   flavours coming through?
  Mm.
Let me have that.
  The fresh fig...
  Do you want fig?
  Oh, yes, please.
  I'll give you fig!
There we are. There we are. Caramelised.
  Hot, hot, hot. Give it a little...
  Please do, yeah.
  Go on.
  Mm, mm.
  It would be nice with blue cheese, wouldn't it?
  Mm!
  Equally nice! Oh.
  Hot!
We're looking for a few more moans and who better to invite back than Esther Rantzen and Rebecca Wilcox.
If you'd move round there, my love. Come on in here, girls. OK.
  Ready for a little bit of a treat, here?
  Yes.
  A pescetarian   almost a vegetarian.
  You'd like that?
  That is nice.
  Have a bit of fig tart.
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, all the recipes are on our website.
Please do check it out.
From Paul, Nick, Esther, the beautiful... Where are you?
  That was amazing!
  Try that. That is stonking.
  That is so good.
  Have a go.
