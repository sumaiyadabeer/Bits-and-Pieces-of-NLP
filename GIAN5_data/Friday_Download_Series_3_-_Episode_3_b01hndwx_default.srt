'Give it up for your Friday Download presenters!'
  Welcome to Friday Download.
How was everyone's week? Because I've been revising and... Yeah.
  Awww!
  Revising's good!
I'm revising for everything you could possibly think of!
My school loves going, "You've got an exam next week."
  My school does that.
  "Here's ten pieces of homework."
  My GCSEs are over in 19 days.
  That'll be good.
Have you got a calendar where you cross them out?
Every morning, like...
OK, well, I think it's probably about time
we got on with the show, have an hour off revision.
  Fair enough.
  OK, so now it's time to welcome today's guest.
She was a member of N Dubz...
..the winning judge of last year's X Factor...
and now with her solo career, everyone give it up for Tulisa!
  Take a seat.
  Wherever you want.
  So, as Dionne said, Little Mix won X Factor.
  Mm hmm.
How was it, knowing that you'd just done X Factor as just a judge
and you just beat them?
I can't lie, it was quite a good feeling, yeah.
Did you look at the rest of the judges, thinking, "I won"?
Yeah, Gary was looking pretty smug on the night.
I didn't think it was going to happen,
so when it did, I was like, great!
Little Mix are coming on later in the series,
  if you just want to say hello.
  Hello, muffins!
You're going to be performing later on in the show, Young.
  How is it, being a solo artist?
  Er, relaxing!
  You like it more?
You enjoy different things about being in a band
and different things about being solo.
I enjoyed performing more with N Dubz,
but doing interviews, it's easier by myself.
  I can imagine, with Dappy!
  Cool. Well, thanks so much for coming
on the show, it's really great to meet you.
Thank you for having me.
Here's what's coming up.
Aidan puts the boys through their paces in Dance Download...
Up, down, boom, boom!
..Richard scores a home run in Weekend Download...
It's double trouble for me in Style Download.
Oh, my goodness, it's your Olly Murs music tributes.
And Tulisa performs her number one single, Young.
We're young, we're young, we're young
I said forgive us for what we have done...
Hello and welcome to the Games Download. I have the lovely Georgia
and Aidan with me and we'll be
doing Dirt Showdown as our first game today.
So, basically, it's just a game involving cars where you get to
race around muddy tracks and bash into or avoid each other.
It's quite easy to get the hang of,
  so, Aidan, you're just going to kick it off.
  Let's go.
There's tons of different cars that you can use in the game.
  You've got stuff like pickup trucks, vans...
  How do I brake?
  The left trigger, yeah?
  Ah.
The game mode we're doing just now is actually a traditional race.
Can you play against your friends, or is it one person?
You can, you can do different types of multiplayer.
You can either play online or split screen.
And they've also incorporated
some sort of multiplayer games like Capture The Flag.
I love Capture The Flag! I just want to point out, I'm first.
  Oh, well done, you're doing well!
  Well done!
  Just casual.
So, there's 50 different game modes, they take place all over the planet.
  Oh, oh! That was completely on purpose.
  You're back in first.
Will he get points for doing that? Or is that not in this mode?
  In this mode, you would get a boost for crashing into other cars.
In which case, that would help him get to first.
Well done, Aidan. So, what did you think of that?
  I actually really liked it.
  Yeah?
  Yeah, but it was really easy to turn,
which is a bit of a shock on racing games.
Usually you've got to, like, brake and then swivel round.
As I say, it's not just a racing game,
you've got all types of different game modes.
One potential downfall, you basically
  have to work yourself up.
It doesn't completely ruin the game,
but if you want to just dive in and have fun straightaway,
it might not be the game for you.
OK. See, I'm quite patient.
I want to dive in, so I don't think I would be happy with that.
Right, so that was Dirt Showdown,
and we're very lucky to have had a look at that,
because it's a TV exclusive, it's out in two weeks
and that's the first time it's ever been seen on TV.
  Oh!
  So that's pretty cool. Anyway, now on to today's gadget,
which we are incredibly lucky to be able to have,
because I know I always say this, blah, blah, I'm the the gadget man.
But, this is just, like, ridiculously exclusive.
  This isn't out for ages, yeah?
  I'm excited!
  So, it's called Sphero.
  Is it because it's a ball?
  Well, yeah, I suppose!
  A sphere.
It is just basically a remote control ball.
And it gets controlled by a Bluetooth from your smartphone
or your tablet or something.
  Pop it down on the floor. What's your favourite colour, Aidan?
  Green.
Could I just have the lights down in the studio momentarily, please?
Right, I'll give you a couple of greens to choose from.
  How's that green?
  Oh!
  Bit darker?
  No, a bit... Oh, that one!
  That one?
  That one.
  Sure you don't want that one?
  No.
  You want that one?
This isn't an exaggeration, it's got every colour in the spectrum.
  That's awesome.
  I'm going to move it about a bit.
You can control it in lots of different ways.
You can control it with the tilt sort of mechanism.
You can also control it with a traditional joystick.
Or you can control it using sort of old school tank controls.
  If you would like to have a fiddle...
  Thank you.
  This is the one with the tilt, right?
  Yeah, that's the tilt.
  So you just...
  Oh, wow!
  You work your way round with it.
  Does it make a maze?
  You could make a maze and you could have fun.
  Go!
  Do an S.
  An S?
  Get in and out... A figure 8.
  Now, go round this leg now.
  OK! Yeah, got that.
  In the middle.
  Go through.
  Now, round the other way.
  Sorry!
  You are amazing at this.
  Thank you.
  Sorry!
  Because it's early in the development of this little
bad boy, there isn't much you can do with it
and it is a bit of a simple concept, and the apps are a bit dull.
But I couple of months down the line, I'm sure this concept is going
to come out with something much more interesting, do you see what I mean?
These guys like it, I like it, audience, do you like it?
  Yeah!
  OK, that's good.
So, that's the end of the gadget. Hold on to that for me.
Georgia!
No, it's not actually quite the end of the gadget.
Just to demonstrate that these are shockproof and waterproof.
So, that's just another little aspect.
  Can you not drop it again, that scared me!
  I won't drop it again.
Anyway, that was Orbotix Sphero.
We'll probably be seeing a lot more of that in the future.
Now, it is time for Tyger Versus,
so let's have the rest of our presenters.
  Hiya, nice one. I'm Cel.
  Boom!
  It's all good.
Tyger Versus is the part of our show
where we have a bit of a competition.
The score for the series so far is 2 0 to me,
so it's all to play for.
So, before anything else,
we need to find out what we're playing today.
  The secret envelope?
  Secret envelope.
There's a secret envelope holder in the audience,
please put your hand up.
  Show yourself!
  There he is. All right, mate, what's your name?
  Rowan.
  Hi, Rowan. I'm Tyger. Can I have the envelope, please?
Thank you. Now, may I just confirm that you haven't shared
  the contents of this envelope with anyone here?
  No.
Brilliant, thanks. So this is top secret stuff.
Round of applause, well done, Rowan!
And I can now inform you guys that today's Tyger Versus
is a bow and arrow target game.
Five arrows at the target to score as many points as you can.
The outer ring will score 10 points,
the inner ring will score 20 points
and the centre of the target will be worth 30 points.
  He's the man for this!
  It won't be me.
So, could we please have a look at the randomiser to find out
  who I'm up against?
  I reckon Georgia would be good.
It's Richard.
  Oh, no!
  Rick, best of luck, mate.
  Let's do this.
  Positivity.
OK, so, we're going to take it in turns,
stand at the back of the block.
  Do you want to go first?
  No, I'm just getting ready.
  Right, let's go first then.
I bet this is harder than it looks.
Ooh!
10 to Richard!
Richard! Richard!
Go right a bit! Go right a bit!
  Still got one more.
  Eye of the tiger!
Eye of the tiger! Go on, mate!
30, you're in the lead! Eye of the tiger!
You've got to get a 20.
  Oh, it's even!
  It's even!
  Ooh!
  OK, to settle this, you've got one more arrow each.
The rules are, highest score wins, however, if you both land,
say, on the 20, it's whichever arrow is closest to the centre.
You've got one arrow each. Tyger, you're first.
  Stand in the same position.
  Take the same position.
  Eye of the tiger!
Keep your intensity.
Tyger just got 20.
Richard, you know what needs to be done, you need to get 20 or 30.
If it's 20, it's got to be closer than Tyger's. The last arrow.
He shoots, he misses! It's ended.
Tyger Drew Honey has taken the points.
  Unlucky, Rick, good game, mate.
  I tell you what, that's the most fun.
Anyway, so, yeah, I did just beat Richard there, which means the score
is now 3 0 in Tyger Versus, and that is the Games Download complete.
What did the salad say to the fridge?
Close the door, I'm dressing.
Welcome to another Dance Download.
I'm going to teach you a routine to Bluey Robinson's Showgirl.
This is what it looks like.
Oh, so incredible
Just the way you roll
Straight up on your toes Oh oh oh oh
You just made the show My lovely cameo
Now you're in the spotlight
Girl if there's a ticket I'd like to buy it
Wouldn't miss you for the world
So many ladies want the world but they don't compare to you
Cos you're more than some dressing room excitement
You deserve an encore Can you hear them screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah?
Showgirl
Don't know it but you make me want to scream your name.
Now to help me teach you this routine, I've got two people with me.
First of all, as always, it's Richard.
What's going on?
And also we got Tyger.
  Cheers, mate.
  How are you?
Right, now. You're going to learn today a small routine.
  Funky routine, by the way.
  Get this stretching going on.
Right, first we've got to stretch to the left, to the right.
Now, let's go. Right, routine looks like this.
Yeah.
  Yeah.
  You're going to have to break that down slow for me.
Right, all it is at the start, you just flick your wrists.
  Just little wrist flick.
  Just flick it.
You're going to go flick up, then flick down.
  Hang on, hang on. Do that bit.
  Little flick up.
  Just go   woo!
Woo! Up...down...up...
One leg out as you come up.
  As you bring it down, the other leg pops out, just like that.
  Ah!
Then one, two, point across, point across.
  Three, four.
  How many points do you want?
Then up, down, boom, boom, boom.
Down, bring yourself down. And then stamp up.
What's that?
  Where does this come from?
  What?
  Is there not a point at the end?
  There's not a point at the end.
  So many points, it was confusing me.
  We'll try it to the music,
I'll tell you when to come in, and I want all of you to have a go.
Oh, so incredible Love the way you roll...
Ready? Five, six, seven, eight
One, two, three, four,

  That's hard! So you lean back?
  Yeah. Ready?
Three, two, one, go! One, two, three, four .
One, two, three, four.
Up. One more time.
Showgirl
Don't know it but you make me want to scream your name.
I am completely lost!
I really don't think I did that to the best of my ability.
  Practice makes perfect.
  It does.
  So I want you to go home, do your homework first.
  I will.
Then practise, come back, and show me what you're doing.
  I will do.
  Everyone's going to do that, actually.
I'm there, man. You know the swag's coming up.
So that is dance download complete.
Welcome to TV and movie download.
First up is Britain's Got Talent, the live final. It's gone so fast.
After seven rounds of auditions, five live semifinals,
the final is this weekend, and it's down to ten finalists.
They will be hoping to follow
the likes of my good friend George Sampson,
Diversity and Spellbound, to be crowned
the Britain's Got Talent winner.
However, guys, the power is in your hands.
You can phone in and vote for who you want to win.
Let's have a little look at what's been happening this week
in the semifinals.
  Welcome to the first live semi final of Britain's got talent.
  Here it is!
  That will be a number one hit record.
  Your voice is sick!
This is what I've been waiting for all my life.
Ashleigh and Pudsey!
You're such a fantastic singers.
Congratulations, you could be winners on Saturday night.
Next up is planet Earth Live.
And I know the word that's making you excited, thinking,
how are they going to do this live?
Yes, I love my animal documentaries, and this one is done live.
You're sitting in your room,
and the show is going to be what's happening there and then.
One minute you're watching some black bears in Minnesota,
and hang on   we're off to North Africa to watch meerkats.
Then   live!   we're going over to the Amazon
to watch some otters. I can't wait to see the action.
But things might not go to plan.
You never know, we might see things we didn't want to see,
cos it's live. Well, I'm excited,
so let's take a look at a little clip.
These stealthy and relentless predators are everywhere.
Little Dali could disappear in the snap of a jaw.
Luckily for Dali, he has seven grown up brothers and sisters
acting as bodyguards and keeping watch.
Working as a pack, the whole family piles in to attack the cayman.
And the Cubs are getting caught up in the thick of it.
The otters aren't going to let him get away.
It's almost as if they're taking their revenge.
Now onto movies, and first up it's one for you older ones,
but it is Dark Shadows.
Guys, it is starring Johnny Depp. I know, I can't wait.
It is the new Tim Burton film, and I'll explain a little bit about it.
Barnabas Collins, Johnny Depp's character,
is a really successful businessman in America.
However, he breaks a witch's heart.
Bad idea, Barnabas. We all know this.
And she turns him into a vampire.
However, 200 years later, in 1972, he arises and thinks,
"It's all a bit different."
He's thinking, "Oh, my gosh, this is different."
He realises his business has been taken over by some relatives,
and they're not doing what he thinks they should be doing.
So he thinks, "I'm going to sort this out." Will he do it?
You'll have to watch to find out.
Although it has got the usual Tim Burton Gothic take on the film,
there are some really funny moments in it,
such as when Barnabas is trying to fit in with this new society.
That's quite funny. He's like, "I'm cool, I'm cool. No, I'm not.
"This isn't right." And it is an all star cast.
Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter,
Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz.
Just can't get much better. Here is a sneak preview at Dark Shadows.
If I can't have you, I'll destroy you and your family.
Missed me.
I shall restore the family business to its former glory.
Burn, baby, burn.
  Fight on, Barnabas. Fight on for us.
  And fight, I shall.
  Love me.
  Never.
Dark Shadows was originally a TV series,
and when Johnny Depp was younger, he wanted to play Barnabas Collins,
so it's like a little dream come true, there.
I'm always rooting for you, Johnny.
Now, Tim Burton, he's taken a little bit of a break from Johnny Depp
with this new film, Frankenweenie.
It is a black and white stop frame animation where a boy,
Victor, brings his dog Spark back to life with monstrous consequences.
Shouldn't have done it. I told you, Victor,
you don't bring Spark back to life.
I really like how it's a classic take on the Frankenstein story,
so let's take a look at Frankenweenie.
Sparkie!
I can't believe it!
Your dog is alive!
Sparkie, sshhh! Easy, boy.
I can fix that.
Little fact for you, this was actually a short film 28 years ago,
made by Tim Burton, so this has been long in the making.
Maybe another little dream come true for Tim Burton.
We're throwing the dreams out today, aren't we?
It is out later this year, so keep an eye out.
OK, and the movie on TV this week is The Princess Diaries.
I love this film, I think it's brilliant.
Mia, she's just an ordinary schoolgirl, bit of a geek,
but suddenly she finds out she's the Princess
of a small country in Europe.
So she goes over there, and her grandmother,
played by Julie Andrews, trains her in ways to be royalty.
She teaches how to speak, how to dance,
and how to, you know, do things properly as a princess.
However, does Mia want to leave her old life behind
to become a princess? You'll have to watch to find out.
It's a really fun film that you can sit down and watch with the family.
Let's take a look at The Princess Diaries.
When walking in a crowd, one is under scrutiny all the time.
So we don't schlump like this.
We drop the shoulders, we think tall, we tuck under,
and we transfer the weight from one foot to...
No, princesses never cross their legs in public.
Why don't you just tuck one ankle behind the other,
and place the hands gracefully on the knees?
Ah!
And that's TV and movie download complete.
Still to come on Friday download...
  Cos I don't know
  Don't know

  Bang! Bang! Bang! Oh, I'm excited.
  Bob is your uncle.
  20, that's good.
No one likes exams, right?
That's why I went to help Beth and Liza make revision fun.
Here's what happened.
When you think of twins,
you might think of two people who are quite similar. Not these two.
  I'm Beth.
  And I'm Liza. We're twins but...
  We're pretty different.
As always, they don't know I'm coming,
so let's see if I can sneak in without them noticing.
Hi, guys.
I see you're watching Friday Download. That's very impressive.
  Great to meet you.
  Hello.
I guess I'd best explain why I'm here.
I understand that you guys need a bit of help with your revision.
What seems to be the problem?
My problem is I hate maths and I need quite a bit of help.
OK, no worries.
I just need something to make revision a bit more fun.
  OK, so stay motivated?
  Yeah.
That's a fairly common problem. Don't worry.
I have some ideas that will make revision a bit more
fun for both of you.
However, there is a catch.
I'm not going to tell you what we'll be doing
and you have to figure it out for yourself.
The only thing I'm going to say to you is maths bingo.
You have two minutes to go off
and look for stuff around the house you think will help us make that.
  Great. Off you go.
OK, guys. What have we got?
We guessed it was some kind of bingo game so we got all of this.
This is good. Card is what we need and pens are good, as well.
We won't be needing a calculator and I don't know what these are for.
You did well. Well done.
Because we thought bingo was an old ladies' game,
we brought Grandma along, as well.
It's a lovely thought but I'm afraid it's not that kind of bingo.
Maybe next time, Grandma. I'm very sorry.
Maths can be boring at the best of times
but a great way to make it fun is by turning learning into a game.
Bingo is a really popular game.
The idea is to cross off numbers on a piece of card as they're
read out by an announcer.
The first one across the card is the winner.
We're done. You'll know the rules, yeah?
  Yeah. Excellent, let's play maths bingo.
  Are you ready?
  Yeah.
First, what is 9 x 9?
What is the square root of 144?
6 x 6?
Square root of 49?
15 + 15   10 x 2?
100 divided by 2   5?
Bingo!
Surviving your exams is easier than you think when you know how.
Stress doesn't do anyone any good
so give yourself a treat once in a while, like your favourite snack.
Make sure you get enough sleep and you'll be fine.
We were completely shocked. We were watching Friday Download
  and Georgia walked in.
  It was such a big surprise.
There we have it. Everyone's happy. Well, all except Grandma, that is!
Style download complete.
Welcome to this week's music download
where I'm joined by the one and only Aidan Davis.
  Thank you.
  This is like your new home.
  I have officially decided.
This is my second home, this box.
Are you excited to hear this week's music picks?
  That's excitement right there.
  Do you like Men In Black?
  I do.
  This is the men in black...
That's not the song I'm going to be talking about
but it's Pitbull with Back In Time.
It's a theme tune to the new film.
Let's save the world Men In Black
I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit' solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future we have to go back in time
Baby, oh, baby
Oh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one...
Aidan, a little birdy told me you absolutely love this song.
It's not the actual song, it's the beat that gets me.
  The guitar bit?
  Yeah, I love the guitar.
It's actually a sample, I heard.
Pitbull, he's not the most credible rapper on the scene.
There are loads of other rappers who are doing well.
All the songs he does always do well.
  There's no doubt that this one will do well.
  Every song he does goes...
  What do you think of the video?
  I love the Men In Black things.
I think that's why I enjoy watching the video.
I see Will Smith, I'm like...
In the video, they have snippets of the film Men In Black III.
If you want to see what the Men In Black trailer is like,
make sure you watch Friday Download later on in the series
when Kel will be talking about it.
I think you might like my next pick. It's a bit of a girly girl's pick.
It's the Saturdays with 30 Days Of Love.
Each day you're not here
Feels like a thousand years
Need a magician to make time disappear
Once you're near I won't let go
You're what I need and all I know
I can't wait to say I'm coming home, home, home, home
30 days to us 30 days to love
Each second I'm here thinking what I wanna do
What I wanna do, when I get to you
One month, four weeks, too many hours...
When I first heard it, before I knew it was the Saturdays,
you automatically know it's a Saturdays song.
  They've got...
  Their stamp on it. What do you think of it?
I think it's a bit girly, but I do like it. Again, I like the beat.
  It will do well.
  They were on the show.
Exactly, they were on the first series.
Which reminds me, Frankie, you did get my number
so please just ring me.
  Do you want to hear my next one?
  Yup. Let's go.
  My next one is Matrix and Futurebound featuring...
  Luke Bingham.
Called All I Know.
Reach to the sky from the bottom
Living out the dreams that have all came true
Trying to reach to the stars from the heavens
Never givin' up like ya thought I'd do
Reach to the sky from the bottom
Living out the dreams that have all came true
Trying to reach to the stars from the heavens
Never givin' up like ya thought I'd do
This is all I know
This is all I know
I ain't going to stop till I reach my goal
This is all I know
And I know that I need it
This is all I know.
If I'm honest with you, I didn't like it when I first heard it,
but it's grown on me.
  The video catches you straight away.
  Does it?
The intro to the video, you think, what's going on here?
It's a bit dark. Then the song kicks in. If you just hear the intro...
No, that song's wicked. For those who don't know who Luke Bingham is,
he's a new singer/songwriter.
I think this could get him well known in the UK.
  I know him. You know him.
  Exactly.
Now all you Friday Download viewers know of him.
My next pick, we love them.
They're Bajan and it's Cover Drive with Sparks.
Them boys got all the talk
But they don't know a lot
You know my every thought
That's why I make them walk
Oh, and I'm ready to go
On my mind, I can't wait any more
Happy to see you setting me off like sparks
You ignite all the colours inside my heart
On the doorstep like we'd never been apart
Hope you know that I'm happy to see you.
I love this song.
When I first heard it, I did not know it was Cover Drive.
Did you not?
No. It was a completely different sound.
I think it's still got that sound in it.
If you hear their songs, you kind of know it's Cover Drive.
You can hear the Bajan esque. If that's even a word.
Bajan esque, new word. You heard it here first.
Amanda's voice, you can definitely hear it.
  As soon as the tune kicks in.
  There's a little similarity.
I think she sounds like Rihanna.
That's probably because they're from the same place.
Everyone's going to love my next pick. It turns you into a Belieber.
I know this song.
It's been out for a while, but we've finally got the video.
We can finally speak about it.
I think this is my favourite song of the year at the moment.
It's Justin Bieber with Boyfriend.
If I was your man I'd never leave you, girl
I just want to love you and treat you right
If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, never let you go
Na na na, na na na, na na na
Yeah, girl
Na na na, na na na, na na na
If I was your boyfriend.
My final pick, she's been hanging out with us today,
  she's got an amazing single...
She is an X Factor judge
and she's going to perform it for us right now.
Everybody, it's Tulisa with Young.
Oh oh oh oh ah
Oh oh oh oh ah
Forgive me for what I have done
Cos I'm young, yeah, I'm young
Forgive me for what I have done
Cos I'm young, yeah, I'm young
I don't mean to frighten you off
It's just fun, it's just fun
I don't mean to frighten you off
It's just fun, it's just fun
Oh oh oh oh ah We live on the edge of life
Oh oh oh oh ah We don't even compromise
Oh oh oh oh ah
We rush because we're out of time, time, time...
Come on, everyone.
Forgive us for what we have done
Cos we're young, we're young, we're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cos we're young, we're young, we're young...
Get ready to jump!
Come on, everyone. There's one word you've got to shout.
Ready, guys. Young! Ready for the jump.
One, two, three, four, go now!
I make mistakes that I learn from
Cos I'm young, yeah, I'm young
I'm sorry I'm not even done
Cos I'm young, yeah, I'm young
Don't worry 'bout what I'll become
It's just fun, it's just fun
I scream at the top of my lungs
It's just fun, it's just fun
Oh oh oh oh ah We live on the edge of life
Oh oh oh oh ah We don't even compromise
Oh oh oh oh ah
We rush because we're out of time, time, time...
Get ready!
Forgive us for what we have done
Cos we're young, we're young, we're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cos we're young, we're young, we're young...
Get ready, here comes that jump again, everyone.
I want to see you jumping.
And I want to see you screaming one word.
That word is young. One, two, three, four, jump!
Forgive us for what we have done
Cos we're young, we're young, we're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cos we're young, we're young, we're young.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you. Everyone give it up for Tulisa!

Welcome to Fail Download. I am a bit of a dog fan.
This week this fail is based around dogs
because I have found some that are not very good at being dogs.
They're being silly. Let's take a look at their epic fails.
First up it's a dog whose bark is worse than his bite.
Here's a nice young Doberman failing to be a very good guard dog.
He should be helping to protect his family home, but he's not
doing a very job working out what things he should be guarding against.
He actually thinks a little cuddly toy is a real dog.
Yes, he is spending all his energies standing up to a little harmless toy.
He's going to be dog tired if he keeps going much longer.
Next up is a very cute but not terribly clever Dachshund puppy.
There he is just checking his swag in the mirror.
Hold on, he does not seem to understand
the whole idea of a mirror.
He is thinking to himself, "What is this?
"It's another dog who looks exactly like me
"in a room exactly like the one I'm in.
"Oh, and he's moving at the same time as I move. There he goes.
"I move, he moves. It's as if we're the same dog."
Yes, little fellow, it's a mirror. Someone please tell him  
it'll send him barking mad.
Bella, if you're watching at home, I do not want to catch you doing that.
That's an epic fail.
Any dogs watching at home   I'm warning you.
That's Fail Download complete.
Welcome to Hot Or Not.
We are lucky enough to be joined by the gorgeous Tulisa.
Hot Or Not is a part of the show
where we all suggest a topic and between us we have to decide
  whether it's hot or not.
  You're going to go first if that's all right?
  Early mornings.
  I cannot be dealing with those.
  I am sitting exactly where I am.
I do love my bed.
  We're all on Not Hot.
  Why are we all saying that is not hot?
  Tulisa, you go first.
  Cos I would rather be in bed.
  Yes.
  I reckon I could stay in bed all day.
  I have done it.
  Without moving.
  Really?
  Have you not had a day where you just lay in bed?
  I once slept for 16 hours.
What's the latest you have ever got up?
  7.30 at night.
  Nice.
  That is what I'm talking about.
  Did you then have your day as night time?
  Yes.
That's why I get into a routine. I am a night owl.
  I think that's definitely not hot to be fair.
  Yes.
  Not hot.
Sorry, early mornings.
  OK. Can you be my assistant?
  Yeah.
I'm going to move over here for the space.
My hot or not is eating apple cores.
  With the pips in?
  Yes.
  That is disgusting.
  No.
  It's not very nice.
  I'm going to go to the not.
Does anyone want a bit?
No! I can't swallow it. I'm really sorry.
  Just spit it out.
  I'm not hot.
  That's not hot.
Definitely not hot.
  My one is hula hooping.
  That's so hot!
Tulisa, you said you think you could hula hoop.
  Do you want to give it a go?
  Come on.
This is the bit when I regret giving the big talk.
I haven't done this in years.
  I can't hula hoop.
  I think that's hot.
  It took me ages to learn.
I'll have a go. This is a weird one.
  I can't do it.
  I can do it, I just don't like it.
She's got it.
  Did you know that that is one of the best forms of exercising?
  Really?
For the core.
What is the basic appeal of a hula hoop? I've never got it.
  It's all about the hips.
  Have a go.
  You never know until you try.
I try all the time in shops when I see it.
You can't just spin it around.
You got to rest it against your back.
  And then spin.
  Yes.
  You're getting a bit closer.
  I'm getting there.
  That is hot.
  Yes.
  Sorry about that.
My turn. Mine is a web suggestion.
I got the card here. It's from Coral Bouncy Butterfly.
  Coral Bouncy Butterfly.
  Coral Bouncy Butterfly.
It is, talking to yourself. And I'm going to go on the not side.
  I do it all the time.
  Freaks me out a little bit.
  Does it?
  Yes. I do it a lot.
My mum does it and it freaks me out because I am like, "What, Mum?"
And she just keeps talking to herself.
She doesn't tell me what she's saying to herself, so I
think she's got secrets she keeps to herself.
When I'm cleaning I usually count as I clean
so every item I pick up or put away I go,
"One, two, three." Sometimes out loud. It is freaky.
I have heard that you learn your song lyrics by talking to yourself.
Is that true?
I guess so cos you'd have to sing them out loud,
but that would be singing to yourself.
  Everyone does sing to themselves.
  I sing to myself.
That's pretty normal.
That is hot.
I'm next and because I'm a gentleman
I'm going to pass it over to India, who is over here.
  Tell us your topic.
  Meerkats.
  Meerkats.
  I love meerkats.
  They're so hot.
  Let's move over.
I used to love them but then that ad campaign started
and now they just really get on my nerves.
Come on. How cool is that?
  He's a meerkat(!)
  It means no worries for the rest of your days.
  One of my nicknames is Hakuna Matula.
  Why do you like meerkats?
I just think they're cute. They just...
What do they do? Just a little rise.
They are always on the lookout. I love that. Whoa!
Meerkats are hot. That was Hot Or Not. Thanks ever so much, Tulisa,
for joining us. You made it fantastic. Hot Or Not complete.
  I've got a little joke for you today.
  A little joke.
  Just a little joke.
What do you call a woman with egg and bacon on her head?
  Egg bacon head.
  No.
Caff!
Or Cathy!
We have all seen baseball in movies but do we know how to play?
Let's check out how I got on when I went to learn.
Welcome to Weekend Download.
This week I'm going to take it American style. Yes.
I'm going to play baseball.
You're probably wondering where they sent me. New York, Los Angeles?
No. North London.
All I've got to do is find the guys teaching me. They're over there.
  Right, guys, you all right? I'm Richard.
  Hi, I'm Lee.
  Wicked.
Right, boys, tell us about what you do
  and why we're here.
  We are in the GB under 18 baseball team.
  I thought it was just American, this sport?
  No. English play it too.
  There's clubs all over the country.
  Yes?
  Yes.
There's one question I've got to ask. Can I wear the same gear as you?
  Yes, definitely. Let's get kitted up.
  Let's do it.
I'm ready. Where's my bat? I'm ready to go.
Hold on a sec. We've got to warm up first.
  What?
  We've got to warm up. Got to jog, stretch, it's really important.
I don't like the sound of that. Jogging. Serious?
So we're all warmed up. What do I need to know first?
Basic rules of baseball   two teams, nine in each,
three outs and an inning, one team bats while the other fields.
Wicked. So, what am I doing first?
We'll start with pitching.
Hold the baseball with two fingers across the seams
and your thumb underneath.
Here's the rubber. Your back foot goes against this.
Bring your arm back before you push forward with your legs.
So going back
and forwards.
Right. So when do I call strike?
  That's the umpire's job. Leave that to him.
  Right.
I thought I'd be in charge of that. What about touchdown?
  Wrong sport. That's American football.
  Oh, yeah. Sorry.
There you go.
You want to go down there and I'll throw?
  Yeah, I'll catch it.
  Can you catch it?
I've got a powerful throw, you see. You ready for this?
Ah. Needs to be harder than that.
Oh! He's good.
Ah!
Oh, sweet!
  Right, so what's next?
  Batting.
  Got a bat for you.
  It's all good.
First, for safety reasons, you need a helmet.
First of all, the grip. You want to line your knuckles up on each hand.
  Pressing that way. So if you point your fingers out,
they're parallel, like that.
Now the stance. You want your feet nice and wide.
Then stand off the plate a bit. The ball will come here.
Don't let it hit you.
Then your hands up high, and your elbows up,
then, as he's going to throw the ball,
bring your hands back and then forwards.
I can see a home run coming.
You look ready to face some live pitching.
Do you want him to come in and throw some to you?
Yeah, let's do it.
Ooh!
Run for that one!
It's not bad. It's quite easy, this, innit?
You're getting good. Fancy a game with the rest of the team?
With the Great Britain team? Heh, yeah, well, I'm not that good.
Don't worry about it. You'll be fine.
All right. I can try. Let's do it.
Right, I'm getting ready for my first game. I'm going in to bat.
Wish me luck.
Play ball!
Right, time for me to get pitching.
See what this guy's got.
So, here's what I've learned today in a few basic steps.
How to start playing baseball.
Step one   get yourself a bat and ball for as little as £20.
Then get down the park with a mate to practise.
Step two   pitching and batting.
To pitch, put your two fingers over the seam like so.
Then raise your arm back and throw at a medium pace.
Gripping the bat, make sure you have a firm grip, knuckles to knuckles.
Point both index fingers and they should be parallel.
Then pull your arms back, raise your elbows to shoulder level
and make sure you've got a nice, steady swing.
When you're batting, always have a helmet on.
You can get one for about £15.
Step three   the rules.
As a batsman, you get three strikes
and then you're out.
The aim is to run to each base until you're all the way round.
The team at the end with the most runs is the winner.
Richard was pretty good.
He should start playing baseball at his local club.
  Run for that one!
  Richard's done well for his first time.
If he keeps at it, he could be good.
Know what? I think baseball is my new favourite sport,
even if the best part was wearing a glove.
If only I can work out how to get it off.
See you, guys. I need help.
Now, I don't think I'll be making the GB squad any time soon
but I think I look cool in all the gear. What do you think?
Eh? Yeah? OK. Well, that's Weekend Download complete.
We're here at Star Download, with the wonderful Tulisa.

So not at the top, you're not second
but you beat Carly Rae Jepson, so she's not going to get called.
For the second time.
Hoo hoo!
I'm joking!
Sss! Burn.
So that is Star Download complete.
  Welcome to Music Tribute Download. I'm here with Georgia.
  Hello.
This week, you guys at home
have been performing your version of Olly Murs' single Oh My Goodness,
which he performed here at the end of the last series.
  It was awesome.
  It was amazing. And actually, the music video
was filmed in a shopping centre, so they had to film it
when it was closed from 9pm to 9am in the morning.
  Night shoot.
  Yeah.
  Killer, killer.
  By the way...
  Yes?
Keep an eye out for Henry Ruff from Nottinghamshire,
who superimposed himself running backwards on a rollercoaster.
  I will do.
  So many things there.
Here we are   Oh My Goodness.
Don't know
If I can stop now
If I can stop now
I'm going too fast, heart first
My head just can't slow me down
And I don't care
If you don't break my fall
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for
I'm rolling downhill, no brakes
Can't go back now, it's too late
Oh
It's too late to look away
And unfeel what I feel for you
Look away
And unsee what I see in you
I'm going to go for it
I hope you're ready
Cos I don't know
Don't know
If I can stop now
If I can stop now
I'm going too fast, heart first
Henry, mate, I hope that running didn't tire you out.
  You were just going on that rollercoaster.
  He was. Also,
did you see Emily Hallett from Winchester,
  who was wearing an "I love Olly Murs" hoodie?
  I did.
She was rocking the Murs, looking suave. I love the Murs.
  Nice.
  So...
  Should we do it together?
  Together.
  Right, one, two, three.
