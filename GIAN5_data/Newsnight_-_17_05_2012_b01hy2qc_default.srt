Athens the rain is flooding in, the money is flooding out. Tonight an
agency lowers Greece's credit rating even further.
Here in the birth place of democracy, more and more people are
rejecting mainstream democratic parties. I will be finding out what
that tells us about Greek society. The G8, the big industrial powers
are about to meet in America, all say they want a solution to the
euro crisis, but can any of them actually produce an answer?
Should this controversial trial of GM wheat in Hertfordshire go ahead,
or be torn up. For the first time we bring
together scientists and GM opponents to debate whether this
plea should be heeded. We know we cannot stop you taking the action
you are planning to take, but please reconsider, before it is too
late, and before several years worth of work, to which we have
been devoting our lives, will be destroyed forever.
And just when you thought it was safe to go back into the financial
are mounting out. We will ask Nassim Nicholas Taleb,
Good evening, today one journalist wrote that the Greek crisis was
reducing our leaders to the figure in Edvard Munch's Scream, howling
in despair, with little ability to affect events. As the most powerful
people on our planet make their way to America for tomorrow's G8, the
eyes of the world rest on an election in a small country whose
results may affect all our tomorrows.
First we report from Athens. Handing over the Olympic Flame for
Princess Anne. It is a torch of unity and peace, but the Olympic
Flame was entrusted to its latest temporary keepers today. By a
nation that itself is deeply divided, on the edge, some fear, of
more social strive. Everyone knows Greece is the birth place of some
of Europe's most cherished values, including the idea of
representative Government. Why then, here of all places, are so many
people now rejecting mainstream politics, even questioning the
democratic system. Is it simply a protest at falling living standards,
or does it tell us something more fundamental about Greece itself.
Among the newly elected MPs sworn in today, were members of extreme
right wing party, Golden Dawn, regarded by many as Neo Nazis. They
are entering parliament for the first time, with 7% of the vote.
Today, gay activists were marking the international day of action
against homophobia, in an Athens bookshop. They are worried that
discrimination, and even violence against minorities of all kinds may
now increase. We fear a rise of the far right, especially now that we
are having a far right party within parliament. The gay community is
afraid about the challenges these people will impose on the
legislative protection of the rights of gay people, especially
the gay youth. We have come to think of ancient
Greece as a stronghold of enlightenment. But attitudes here
are as complex as the country's multilayered history. A society so
confident and outward looking in antiquity, was forced to turn in on
itself during the long centuries of otman ox passion, that ended only
in the 19th century. Greece was liberated partly by its own
patriots, but only by the help of foreign powers. Greece has always
depended on the kindness, or lack of it, of strangers. That has made
the Greeks susceptible to humiliation, that has occurred and
recurred in Greece's history on many occasions. Nevertheless, I
would say that Greek political leaders and politicians, in general,
were made of very good stuff. That's what saved Greece from many
a difficult decision in the past. Not so today. Today our politicians
are not up to it. That's perhaps why, in a city district of Athens,
they voted against the main parties, accusing them of caving into the
European Union over the bail out terms. This is a stronghold of the
radical left. Inside the district, these graphic designers have left
their jobs in the mainstream media, and set up an independent co 
operative, it is one of many ventures across Greece, designed to
create alternative economic and social networks, forming islands of
freedom, as they put it, outside the despised state. Their aim,
above all, is to help those impoverished by the crisis.
Everybody gets together and brings food and cooks together, for a
minimum, a small price, or most of the time for free. But there can be
entertainment, like through free cinemas, or theatrical plays. So
people need real solutions to their every day problems. That comes
through collectives or through self organised projects. They are
growing and spreading all over Greece, like a virus in a way.
The rot in the system set in soon after the collapse of the military
junta, that ruled Greece for seven years up to 1974. The hopes that
came with the return of democracy, couldn't all be fulfilled. The man
who dominated Greek politics in the 1980s, the socialist, Lucas
Papademos, delighted many    Papandreaou, delighted by railing
against America and others. undercurrent of somebody is out to
get you, the conspiracy theory, the friend foe division, has been
fighting the fires of Golden Dawn, Syriza and the far left. It is the
frame of mind, the way of thinking that our ills are not our own, and
brought upon us by others. Long before the flame reaches London,
after its journey around Britain, Greece will have yet another
parliament. But few expect it will be one that can restore the Greek's
confidence in their political system.
We can join Tim now. Give us a sense of what it feels like there
tonight what are people preparing for in the next couple of days?
are preparing for the new elections on June 17th. The opinion polls
certainly suggest that the left  wing grouping, Syriza, the party
grouping that rejects the terms of Greece's pail out, will do even
better in these coming elections. Although, some people think
actually the polls may change, the final vote will be different, and
perhaps Greeks, if you like, will draw back from the brink and return,
perhaps, out of fear of the consequences, to the mainstream
party. While we are in this limbo, we have further news of the
developing liquidity crisis here. What we have heard today is now
Greek patients in pharmacies will have to pay for the first time up
front for their medicines, that is because of the enormous arrears,
the enormous amounts of money that pharmacies are owed and haven't
been paid by the state backed health insurer.
World leaders are heading to America for a G8 meeting tomorrow.
Here is our diplomatic editor. Fresh fears you assume of contagion
tonight? Absolutely. Some strong elements of deJay have you last
night over Greece. FITCH has downgraded Greece to triple C, and
France was worried about losing triple A. People are talking about
a slow motion run on the banks in some parts of Spain. I don't know
if that is some talk. There is disagreement over how tough we
should be with Greece, on whether the package put forward by Nicolas
Sarkozy and Angela Merkel last year, should be stuck to. Or whether the
new formula of Francois Hollande, more of a growth based approach
should be adopted. How are the key eurozone leaders reacting then, we
see it as Germany versus the rest of southern Europe? Increasingly it
is looking like Germany versus almost everybody. Strong hints
being given out today by Downing Street that David Cameron also
favours a solution of looking more at growth, of trying to help Greece.
In that sense he could make a very favourable first impression with
Monsieur Hollande tomorrow in America, as a possible ally. They
have a huge number of things to talk about. The really key issue
that still divides people in the EU, is the funding of the called
firewall, or the big bazuka, the funds that could be needed to
protect the banks, and where exactly the money is coming from
growth. Some suggestion that is there could be compromises over
structural funds, and structural redevelopment, Hollande says the
European bank should issue its own bond, and Britain has said things
in the past. The gerplgs are adamant they don't want to do that,
because they will end up paying for it. We talk about the eyes of the
world, is America immune to this, we are looking ahead to the G8 at
Camp David? They are absolutely not immune from it. There seem to go
signals that President Obama may be joining that gang in putting
pressure on Angela Merkel. Because he too is worried that if things go
wrong over the next few weeks with a possible Greek exit, that could
impact the US economy, carrying them back to a double dip, while
many of the economic indicators at the moment are OK. And the
Europeans are heading over to reassure him that they will come up
with something. There is a very important meeting in Europe next
week. Meanwhile, we have a message of reassurance from the President
of the European council. I believe that in spite of all the
difficulties, and we are not complicit in had the challenges, we
are on the right track. I bring you a message of confidence. We are
doing a root and rang reform. have Mario Baldassarri, an Italian
senator who sits on the budget committee, David McWilliams, an
Irish economist, our guest from Skype, and Chrystia Freeland from
the USA will be joining us a little later.
David McWilliams, if I can start with you, we know Ireland has taken
the bitter pill, how do people there see the drama in Athens?
look Atkinson thens, people are nervous    at Athens, people are
nervous and see it moving towards an end game in Athens. We also
realise, having gone through four years of this ourselves, that the
three big issues aren't solved, there is too much debt, no growth
and no political leadership. As a consequence of that, and
particularly the legacy of debt, the economies continue to weaken.
We in Ireland can understand exactly what is going on in Greece,
not least because we are clearly not in a situation quite as bad as
Greece, but in a broadly similar situation when people have too much
debt, they don't want to spend. When the banks, as you heard from
your correspondents have too much bad debt, they don't have the
ability to lend. And consequently, imposing austerity on a country
where the people don't want to borrow, and the banks don't want to
lend, is almost like putting an anorexic on the diet, and expecting
that person to put on weight and get stronger. Ultimately from the
Irish perspective, we have seen the legacy of debt, and the fact there
is no political leadership, leading to the growth rate falling, this
increasing the level of unemployment, and increasing the
agitation of people. Let me ask, with your anorexic on a tkwriet, do
you see that as a    diet, do you see that as a fiscal referendum on
the pact, will you say no to that? Many Irish people will looking at
what is happening in Greece and Spain at the moment. They realise
that the game is in play. In that sense, as your correspondent was
saying, Germany has to shift. We are moving towards probably a grand
bargain in Europe. Therefore, the fiscal treaty in Ireland may well
be seen by many Irish people as an opportunity to express our
dissatisfaction, which is what is going on. This has changed over the
last couple of days really. Because of what's happening in Greece, and
because of what's happening in Spain. Briefly you think there will
be a no vote there? I think the polls will narrow very dramatically
over the course of the next ten days. Interesting to watch that.
Let's go to Spain and pick up the story there. There was a rumour of
a run on a major bank there. Do you think your own Government can bail
out the banking system? I don't think it can, I don't think it can
find the funds needed to bail out the entire banking system, in Spain
we have a two tier banking system, there are solvent banks, large
institution, and we have what is left over, left behind from the old
system, being transformed into banks, while this is happening they
still have governance problems, and we have these big, big problems
with Bankia, whose balance sheet is about 38% of Spanish GDP.
Essentially it is worth nothing. That was the bank that was not
really run, but which was having a large flee of deposits. A lot of
people, frankly, are saying Spain is next in line. How big a bail out
do you think you would need? know the way we see it from here
today, at this point in time, May 17th, it is not that we need a 50%
of GDP bail out like the ones that have been served for Greece and
Ireland and Portugal, but it is rather something more to the tune
of maybe 50 billion euros, to bail out the banking sector, the damaged
part of the Spanish banking sector. I don't think right now anybody in
Spain is thinking a major bail out with a major intervention from the
IMF, the ECB and the European group institutions. Mario Baldassarri,
the Italians, Italy would love to see Germany bail out Greece, right?
Well, you know, the key point is that we are playing some kind of
sado masochistic end game since the beginning of the Greek crisis. The
key point is we have to cheer up what we are talking about. We are
facing a crisis of a small country, 11 million inhabitants, over 320
million Europeans. It is like a crisis in a council asking to go
with the dollars and the United States and the Federal Reserve. We
don't yet have the United States of Europe. And actually we need to
behave as we would have already have the United States of Europe.
Which is asking French for financial equilibrium, but giving
them some kind of Marshall Plan to readjust not in ten months, but ten
years. This should be a United States of Europe. This is something
that Germany has to understand. think that Germany has been unfair
on Greece so far? Well, the point is this, two years ago, if you had
given Greece 40 billion euros support, and then ask it the day
after, asking Greece to take under controlled administration the
accountant with Greece, with 40 million euros two years ago, the
situation could be faced at that time. Now it might be that it will
cost 150 billion euro, and maybe Greece will go out of the euro.
point is it is very politically sensitive, you listen to Ireland,
to Spain, to Italy, if you were a German taxpayer now, you would be
saying why is this burden just falling on us? Because it would be
a disaster for Germany. Germany cannot behave a single country,
without facing the globalisation. Europe needs to have the United
States of Europe. Germany may lead this process, but take the
responsibility, not only to save Greece, Spain or Italy, whatever.
But to save the future of Germany. Can you say, David McWilliams why
the Germans would feel they have got shafted, they got a pretty bad
deal here? You have to look at it from the German point of view. The
German point of view realises there is three reasons they want the euro
to stay in place. The first is, they do a huge amount of trade, the
lion's share of their trades with the rest of the eurozone. This
gives them stability. The second idea, a new damp mark, if it came
around, would dram    Deutschmark, if it if it came around would
dramatically decrease trade. The Germans like all the capital
leaving the periphery, Italy, Spain and Ireland, is going to Germany.
They are getting a free lunch in terms of their own interest rates,
they are falling dramatically. They have three big reasons to stay in.
The way I see it, it always seems that Germany is a bit like a very,
very good, house proud neighbour n a bad estate, in a bad
neighbourhood. Increasingly what is happening is the neighbours are
behaving more delinquently, than the Germans need to deal W they
need to the fix the thing. Therefore, they have a price. The
price is, what price is Germany willing to pay for their neighbours
to clean up their act. That is really where we are going right now.
Chrystia Freeland is nodding as you speak. I want a US perspective. It
was interesting to hear from Mark, that Obama is also pushing for more
support from Angela Merkel. Why does America have to care, it's on
the road to recovery now isn't it? Traditionally America doesn't care
that much about Europe, particularly this year with an
election season. Europe has been pretty far off the political and
economic agenda. But, with the crisis intensifing in Europe, a lot
of people, particularly in the White House, close to the President,
are really starting to worry that what happens in Athens and Berlin,
could play a bigger role in deciding the US election in
November, than anything that happens in the United States. So
Barack Obama in particular, is desperate for Angela Merkel to fix
this. So the suggestion is the other side would be quite happy to
see everything going belly up? think no political leader will ever
say he wishes ill on the world, but certainly, I think it is true that
if the global economy gets a lot weaker, and with it the US recovery
gets knocked off worse, that certainly is good for Vladimir
Romanov and bad for Barack Obama. The    Mitt Romney, and bad for
Barack Obama. The other interesting thing is playing into the American
debate, is whether you should be focusing on austerity and cutting
budgets, or stimuli. Both sides claim Europe as vindication of
their views. We are running out of time.? In a couple of words, will
Greece stay in Europe? I think not. Mario Baldassarri? I hope question
   yes, because the alternative would be very costly for everybody,
including the United States. David McWilliams where do you sit on
this? I don't think the Greek also stay in the euro, I don't think
they can possibly do that, their economy is too weak, they will move
in the next few weeks away from the euro. That is what the politics are
telling us. Javier Diaz Gimenez? I'm hoping the Greeks will find a
way to keep the euro area together. Thank you for joining us. Could
destroying a field of plants be the same as burning books. That is what
scientists are claiming in the face of action by protestors being
threatened in ten days time in Hertfordshire. Scientists there
admit they can't prevent the plants being destroyed, but are pleading
for it to continue. We have the head of the project and a leading
activist Take The Flower scam back    Back.
This is GM wheat, the first of its kind in the world. It is being
modified to repel aphid pest, which cost farmers millions in lost yield
and damage to crops. Researchers want to test it in open air, the
opponents say the trial is a risk, some plan to destroy it. Prompting
an unusual YouTube plea from the team that created it. We know we
cannot stop you taking the action you are planning to take, but
please reconsider, before it is too late, and before several years
worth of work, to which we have been devoting our lives, will be
destroyed forever. We appeal to you as
environmentalists...Toby Bruce is one of the researchers. The wheat
has an added gene, that makes it release a chemical signal, similar
to one aphids produce naturally, to alert one another to danger.
idea of these plants is to rebel the aphids, but attract their
natural enemies. In this demo, if a drob of the alarm signal is dropped
here the aphid, they crawl away, at quite a pace. With what are
spectacular lab results, the next test is to see if the modified
wheat works outside. The head of their serial transformation lab
told us they are having to take extraordinary measures. The fence
is there for two reasons, to protect the trial from foxes and
rabbits that might want to eat the plants. But also to prevent access
to unauthorised humans. That includes the protestors, they have
installed CCTV, and an infrared beam around the edge of the field.
It is not easy to get close to these plants. But security is
expensive. A quarter of the project's total cost, so far.
Opponents say the work should stay in the lab, because out in the open
there is a risk that GM pollen will travel beyond the test field. But
the scientist say the risk of that happening is tiny. Wheat is self 
pollinated. It is not pollinated by wind or insects, excess pollen will
fall to the ground, it is heavy and has a short life span. Once outside
the flower it will last an hour or less. The experimental plants sit
inside a buffer zone, designed to lower the risk of any GM pollen
escaping. Peter is a conventional farmer in Lincolnshire, and a vocal
critic of this trial. He grows wheat and rears gloser All Spot pig
   Gloucester All Spot Pigs, he questions why the scientists are
testing a wheat that is rarely grown in the UK. Spring wheat, a
variety used for the trial, is only 1% of the UK wheat crop. This is
winter wheat, that is the 99% we depend on to feed the animals and
the people. The test may moven to winter wheat, but Peter is not
convinced this is something he needs at all. If aphids become a
problem in spring wheat, and they don't always. I have access to
selective insecticide that is are reasonably safe to use with bees
and ladybirds and others, and only cost �2 an acre. He wouldn't go so
far as destroying the GM wheat, but is he concerned that such crops
pose a threat to farmers' livelihoods. In America a small
trial in rice ended up contaminating the whole United
States rice harvest. There is potential for enormous damage.
incident with GM rice, not an isolated example of contamination,
prompted temporary bans in 2006 in Japan and Russia, on rice imports
from the US. After trace amounts of a non authorised GM rice was found
in commercial supplies. Protestors objected to research
trials, partly because of that leakiness in the food chain, when
GM crops was first planted out in the UK some ten years ago. They saw
this as a technology being forced on consumers, who didn't want it,
and which put multinatural co  operations in charge, not farmers.
Europe entered a decade of stalemate over GM agriculture.
Elsewhere the planting of GM crops has increased steadily. The latest
figures from the industry indicate that some 160 million hectares of
GM crops, such as soya bean and maize was grown across the globe.
The top growers were the US, Canada, India, China, China growing four
million hectares, little was grown in the African continent, apart
from three million hectares, Europe is banging back, with one million
of hectares grown last year. Many scientists take the view that since
such a volume of GM crops has now been grown, and eaten around the
world, any serious problem would be apparent by now. Where the harm to
human health, or widespread impact on the environment.
The National Farmers' Union says we will need every tool in our tool
box to meet future food demands, including GM crops, that can cope
in dry conditions, need fewer pesticides, or offer nutritional
benefits. We see a lot of it as being public good. One of the
things we can do is offer something that maybe industry would never
come up with, the reduction of the use of chemicals. We need to prime
the pump with new ideas to give alternatives. First of all, it is
giving choice in the overall system, so that we can actually do some
public good, by reducing pesticide use. I think the general public are
certainly interested in that. But campaigners argue there has not
yet been the systematic data collection, to be certain of the
effects of GM. We're not saying stop doing research on GM, but we
won't be in the lab until we fully understand how genes work, how they
relate to the environment and each other, and what makes them tick. We
don't know all that yet, and we shouldn't introduce things into the
environment and food chain until we have a pretty good understanding of
it. Way beyond what we have at the moment.
Some campaigners say there is a third way. Scientists have decoded
entire genetic maps for staple crops. Here you see a model of the
way rice genes interact. This means they can select plants that carry
desirable genetic traits, and breed from those, rather than adding in
extra genes. Meanwhile the scientists concede they don't have
all the answers, which is why they want to conduct the GM experiment,
the protestors argue that the trial represents a threat to British
farming. And if the scientists won't stop it, they say, they will.
Here in what is a completely GM  free studio, our guests are with us.
It is great to have you all here. Thank you for coming in.
We heard from a speaker who said he certainly didn't want to stop the
research, even though he was against GM. Are you going to let
this trial go ahead? I certainly believe in the power of non violent
direct action, in illustrating something that is a really
important principle, that is this is the sort of science we don't
want progress to move in the direction of, because it is really
dangerous. I appeal very strong    I feel very strongly it is
important to look at the wider cultural and social implications of
GM ago tulure, I think it is a very dangerous stamp of validity when
you look at the trial. Would you stop it, you will uproot the plant?
I will stop it. I would like to decide on the day if it is a valid
action. I believe it is important to state you will do that sort of
thing, in order to get on Newsnight and talk about it, and say can we
enter into a debate about this. People have been writing lots of
letters, people have been entering into consultations, all the GM
protestors have been saying for over a decade, we don't want
Government research to be focused on GM technology when there are
other things available. We need direct action to stop that. We have
a mandate by achieving the research grant for doing this work. It is
top science, and it is in the direction of producing food in a
more sustainable way. We are using GM only experimentally at the
moment, it is not going into the food chain. It is not part of a
commercial development. What do you mean by sustainability. What I mean
by sustainability, is if you can deliver crop protection through the
seed F you can have in the plant its own way of dealing with pests,
then you don't need to drive a tractor over the crop with a spray
on it, and the carbon footprint. There is holistic ecosystem
management. As you know, we work in Africa in just that way, because,
in fact, there, people are not buying fertilisers, and not buying
seed, so you can't deliver it in that way. We use companion cropping,
as you may in organic farming. me ask you something, you said this
was purely for science. But you said in the past that companies are
keeping a watching brief, and you are wined and dined heavily by
academic groups in the UK. There is money to be made for you out of
this? Not for us, we do our work to get grants for research, elite
research, which we get during the process of competitive tendering,
as it were, with due regard to our peers and what they consider it.
There is no way this is science for science sake? No, I said it was in
the direction of sustainability. I have explained why it is leading to
a sustainable approach to agriculture. In your terms, in your
terms, we have other terms of sustainability. If you want to go
out and companion plant, in a wheat crop in Britain, you will have to
put a lot more labour in. I'm a full time farmer, I know farmers
all around me who do companion planting, they plant banks of wild
flowers along the edges of the field, and mounds for wild flowers,
they do it here. I'm going to bring in Lawrence, you have spoken and
thought a lot about organic farming, this, in a way, sounds like it is
the grown up version, the green version of GM, a decade on, isn't
it? Not at all. My background is organic farming, I'm involved now
with a group of citizens concerned about GM, not necessarily opposed
to GM, but concerned about GM. Our concerns about this trial. First of
all, we don't believe it is necessary secondly, we don't
believe that the process of    necessary, secondly, we don't
believe the vetting process has been adequate. And thirdly, if we
are talking about grown up ecology, this group and other research
groups, reported 2005, a three year trial, a million pound of tax 
payers' money spent, looking at ecological actions, dealing with
aphids, without as youing GM and chemicals, looking at the farming
systems, the hedgerows, the surround of the fields, this hasn't
been taken into account in the trial. Are you saying, stop that
science now, we have had enough? I'm saying this trial is
unnecessary, on a crop that really doesn't suffer from aphid problems.
You don't like this kind of science at all, right? As was said in the
film, I think the GM research really needs to be done in
controlled environments, when you take it out into the field, it
raises bigger problems, bigger risks, and those need to be
assessed properly. Our regulatory system doesn't do. That we need a
question about need. We need to be clear here that we are talking
about a controlled environment. In a sense this research is going on
in a experimental setting. It is not a controlled environment.
let her speak. The thing they are looking for researchers to find out,
are the very answers to the questions that you are posing. If
we cut off that research lion, we aren't going to answer it. It is
foolish, I agree...Does It matter that the public has consistently
shown itself to be against this kind of testing? I think there is a
change in climate at the moment. We are getting a tremendous amount of
support. I'm very sad that some people are not supporting us, I'm
very keen to engage in further dialogue on this, to explain our
point of view. We are certainly looking at an experiment, we have
chosen wheat, because it is our most important crop, and aphids are
the most important pests on it. We can work on winter wheat, as you
know we have it in cond,    condenza. Aphids are not a problem
in winter wheat. Last year we had a big problem in aphids in spring 
sown wheat. Our out of the last six sea ons there is no aphid problems
in the UK. Four out of the last six seasons. Aphid transmit a virus to
wheat, that is transmitted by aphids in the autumn. That becomes
a problem because of early drilling, you can deal with that problem.
Let's step back, because the point of the winter and the summer, is
that summer wheat tends to be a crop that is grown more in the USA.
It is something that they use more, which suggests that what you are
planning long term. There is no conspiracy here, we are very keen
to see how this kind of approach works. Winter wheat would be a very
nice model, it would be a lot more expensive to be the experiments
initially on it. We are doinging it in spring sown wheat, in a variety
that can be grown as a winter wheat. If you are looking at this properly,
and talking about serious ecological interactions to deal
with aphids, this trial should look more at the margins of the field,
the hedgerows. What gives you, wait a second, what gives you the right
to say this kind of trial, this kind of science should not go
ahead? Because I have a lot of experience and I feel very
passionately about it. I'm a farmer myself. My family has a farm in
Iowa, and I have directly seen the impact of GM agriculture, and the
intensive affect on our family farm in Iowa. It is very much about the
land in one sense, and now farmers are being pushed and pushed and
pushed to cultivate huge margins, and go to the edge of the fields to
get the maximum amount about fields. You are making moral decisions the
whole time? We can sit and "cherrypick" all kind of stories,
there are mixed stories. Just let Tracey talk? Which is is actually
why it is that it would be much more valuable for you guys to be
involved in a debate, rather than come in and rip up the experiment.
There is an awful lot of information. You don't seem to be
wanting to go on the debate with us, we have offered a debate on Tuesday.
We would like a more thorough debate. We think the debate should
precede you destroying the experiment, if that is what you are
doing. If we didn't threaten it, you wouldn't have asked us.
least see the results of the debate before attacking the crop. That
sounds positive, it soupbtdz like you won't go ahead with ripping up
the crop, but would rather debate. I'm not going in either direction.
Do you think it will succeed? think there are many problems with
doing experiments in the field. We have to do the experiment, we have
done a lot of work in the lab. Experiments don't work the first
time. We have to see how it stands up to the rigours of the outside he
can kolg. I think it would be a very good    Ecology. Farmers have
beenest iting this sort of thing for centuries, they have been work
   this sort of thing for    testing this sort of thing for
centuries. What do you make of the National Farmers' Union who say we
have to use every tool in the tool box to fight growth in population
and starvation, they don't count, the National Farmers' Union don't
count? They are working on a lower level. You have to look in the
farming press, many conventional farmers have come out and said this
trial is irrelevant. We had one farmer on the video earlier. This
trial is irrelevant, this work is irrelevant. This is not true.
asked whether people are for origins, I think we need to stop
asking people that question. What GM does is opens up a very exciting
and interesting area of research, that may provide answers to some of
the most pressing questions. We can't blank it. Has your mind been
change bid this discussion? I would like to discuss it further, and I
would like to encourage you to look at the wider social implications.
We have done, and we will discuss it with you as much as you like.
Thank you very much indeed. If you understand the complexties
of how the trader they call the London Whale, lost his bank JP
motoring began three billion dollars and counting, you are doing
better than us. Has the world got wiser with the risks and rewards
that dominate highens if, or are we still in danger of the    dom
dominate, are we still in danger. The portfolio has proved to be more
risky and volatile to the economic edge than we thought.
Today JP Morgan admitted their losses amount to at least $3
billion and could be more. They were caused by the trader, Bruno
Iksil, who earned the Monday Kerr "the London Whale," because of the
size of the transactions he did. Ina Drew quit the bank this week as
it fought to contain the losses. It is hardly the first financial
scandal to hit the markets. Earlier this year there was a collapse of
MF Global, after billions of pounds of disastrous bets went wrong.
There have been sweeping changes to bank regular gaigs, but critics
argue big bonuses, big risks and big losses seem as common as ever.
Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Professor of Risk and Engineering and author of
The Black Swan is in New York and talking to us this evening. It
feels time and time again we have seen this happen. Why do the banks
let it happen, do they not know about it, turn their back on it or
do they not understand it? I think all three. Primarily I think
incompetence, they don't seem to know what they are talking about
when talking about risk. We have known since 1998 that two of the
tools used to manage risk don't work. We have had the tragedy of
LTCM, Long term Capital Management, a firm that got the wrong name,
that went bust relying on these tools. We kept using the same
methods. In 2007 we discovered these methods of risk don't work,
they were relying on the risk metrics. So it is nonsense, they
are using the wrong tool, it is part of a system, it would happen
else where building bridges, and telling us these bridges can landle
500 trucks and they break at the third truck. Visibly we are    can
handle 500 trucks and they break at the third truck. Visibly we are
using tax payers' money as a back stop. They don't want to learn.
I want to get on to that in a second, that is key. Looking at
this example, it is a very complicated derivative system, but
broadly, this man, the London Whale, was trying to balance the risks. He
was trying to make it impossible to lose. Why would that go wrong?
Number one, it is based on a big illusion, the fact that we
understand the risk of rare events. It is a business they shouldn't be
in, it is too complicated for them. We have known the business is too
complicated for Wall Street, for the banks, or all banks, we have
known it is very complicated. They should get out of that business. JP
Morgan should concentrate on lending money to farmers, or
whatever, car loans, that is the business they should be in. They
shouldn't be using my money to play in a way that is too dangerous and
complicated for them. JP Morgan has ten times the risk of the original
hedge fund. Do you say they should be more regulated or they should be
allowed to go bust when it goes wrong? Both of them. When the event
happens, I'm against you know nationalisation, and I'm against
centralised Government. I'm against regulation. I was a derivatives
trader for 20 years, and it gained regulation. I wanted a following, a
skin in the game, people who make money, if they have the upside,
they should get a bonus, and people should be down with the down side.
Hedge funds had that. The risks that are pure risk, gambling, if
you like, these risks should be borne by hedge funds with up sides
and down sides. Banks, if we are bailing them out, they are ustill
fees, why not treat them    utilities, why are you treating
them like utilities. You know you will never convince the banks to
leave that side of stuff alone. If it didn't happen as a result of
Liam mans, it is never going to happen   ly mans, it is never going
   Lehmans, it is never going to happen? There is a saying, you will
never convince a general that the war isn't happening. You can never
ask an industry, you have to force it on them. We should never have
bailed out the banks so easily in 2008 without explaining them, de
facto, you are civil servants. If you are bailing them out, they are
civil servants. They went to pay themselves the highest level of
bonuses in 2010, it is an insult to our intelligence ,ing these metrics
is an insult to our intelligence. Do you think the banks should not
have been failed out at all at that point, knowing what you know about
the way banks operate and behave? Two things should have been done,
the first thing is, we didn't bail out Lehmans, we saw the effect,
then came Citibank, we should have then bailed out Citibank on the
very stiff condition, explaining them that you know, you are de
the taxpayer, you are no longer a free entity. I don't mind risks
being taken. You are an idealist? I'm not. I'm not an idealist, I'm
someone who doesn't want to be paying $14 million for this lady,
Ina Drew, more than the Mafia, I don't want to keep paying her that
money for taking risks. Could you convince a politician into saying
that? Politicians, visibly, don't have the courage to face lobbies.
But the public is convinced that they don't have the information.
Thank you very much. That's all from Newsnight tonight. This summer
some, and just to get you in the right mood for bed. We will leave
you with one of her biggest hits. Oh I feel love
I feel love I feel lovele
