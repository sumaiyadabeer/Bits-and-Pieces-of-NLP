Well... I've swum the English Channel.
Most open water swimmers, if they've done the Channel,
they then look for something that they can do that will be unique.
It's almost like charting new territory.
You want to do something that no one else has done.
About a thousand people have swum the English Channel since 1875.
Nine people, I think, have swum between Scotland and Northern Ireland,
but no one has swum between Scotland and the Orkney Isles and I want to be the first,
to be a trailblazer for other swimmers.
Right. So the shortest distance from the Orkney Isles to Scotland, the mainland,
is from here in Boroughness to Duncansbay Head, that's six and a half miles.
I mean, ideally it would be great to swim into John O'Groats, but the pilots, I think, at this stage
and then I'd have to try to swim in to Scotland.
It doesn't matter where you land, as long as you land somehow.
I said to him, "If you want to swim the Pentland Firth,
"we've got to go up there and we've got to be prepared to stay
"for as long as it takes to do it".
'I met Frank 11 years ago.
'We were both freelance journalists at that time
'and I was active in the NUJ, the journalists' union,
'and I was chair of the freelance branch, and he came to one of our meetings.'
Well, you know how when you meet somebody, there are the stages that you find out things
We were driving somewhere and we got talking about cold water swimming
and we found out that both of us had this love of jumping into cold water in the middle of winter,
and that was just amazing cos that was something I've always done.
I always loved seeing Frank swimming, it was like...
He's most himself somehow in the water.
All vessels are requested to navigate with extreme caution and pass at a safe distance.
In my lifetime, I've crossed the Firth about 20,000 times,
but I'd never say that I know it completely
and every crossing I learned something new.
I do have the utmost respect for the Pentland Firth
and I think anybody that doesn't is a fool,
but you'd be amazed how many people have gone through the Pentland Firth on small boats and survived,
not knowing that it was just there to get them.
Probably the strongest tides in Britain.
Definitely. Maybe the strongest in the world, or one of the strongest anyway.
It's a funny bit of water.
It's not like going open sea conditions or going where there's no tide.
If it's rough in one place, then ten minutes later it'll be different, it'll be OK, like, you know?
Making the decision whether to go or not is usually the biggest problem
because if you decide you're not going and the weather gets better, you feel like a fool.
And if you decide to go and you can't get in here, for instance, that's even worse.
People on board and you've got to take them back again. That's even worse.
When I first heard about it, I was quite astonished to think
that anybody would contemplate swimming the Firth   I know how difficult it is to cross on a boat.
I think I was 48 and I thought, "I want to do something before I'm 50."
I wanted to get back to training, swimming in the open water,
and it gave me such a sense of being alive again.
The English Channel is a unique swim.
You know, people from all over the world come to do that swim, and for me, age 50,
it's the greatest physical thing that I've ever done
and it took me 16 hours, 48 minutes and 20 seconds.
And the 20 seconds were the best 20 seconds of my life.
It was great. Crawling up on that beach is absolutely magical.
They dropped off Ros, they took her ahead of me
and she swam in with a waterproof camera down her costume, so it was great.
You know, when I got up onto the beach, she was there
and there's a photograph of Ros and me and I've got my goggles up like this on my head
and, you know, people say, "Oh, you look so happy." I was so exhausted, the tears were running,
you know, down my face.
I was absolutely sobbing with exhaustion
and, you know, you feel you couldn't go another 100 metres and, of course you probably could,
but at that moment I felt that was it, I couldn't have crawled another 100 metres,
but I had made it, you know?
I remember when it really started.
We were sitting in this sort of grey Orkney day
and looking out over the hills of Westray and the Bay of Pierowall,
and then we were looking out at Papa Westray and Frank mentioned that he'd quite like to swim to it,
and then he swam between Papa Westray and Westray...
And that was really I think when...
I think that was the night when the germ of the idea of swimming the Pentland Firth really began.
I really, really love that place and the idea of swimming between Scotland and a place that you adore,
that's the icing on the cake, that's magical because it's not just a stretch of water,
it's swimming between two cultures
and it's swimming between places with a different history.
I want to add to that history.
How exciting   we've got here.
My little heart's going like this.
Poor Ros, she keeps waking up and she says that I'm swimming in my sleep.
A strange thing, I was dreaming about it last night
and I couldn't...I was swimming, but I couldn't find a place to land.
I don't know what that means. Everywhere I was trying to land, the waves were crashing on the rocks
or, you know, the water was splashing up on the cliffs.
So I don't know if that means something.
So I'm going to hope that tonight I dream about swimming smoothly into John O'Groats harbour
and walking up the road for a pint.
The conditions have to be right and I don't know what right is for a swimmer
because nobody has any experience of crossing the Pentland Firth at one and a half knots,
which, apparently, is the speed that Frank swims at.
The only other person I heard about in that area was someone that fell off a tanker,
who got picked up by a coaster that was following it.
The Pentland Firth has been described as the worst piece of water in the world.
There's not a soul I've talked to that's sailed through there has anything good to say about it.
You can see the change in their face, you can see the blood drain when they reminisce.
The currents that go by there are... well, on the chart here at nine knots...
with spring tides, nine knots, nine knots...
there's one at 12 knots.
And you get half as much again in extreme conditions.
It's not like an even sea,
it just comes in at all angles, nasty stuff.
You can't beat experience as far as this type of work goes.
I like to think I've enough knowledge to steer clear of the worst things that can happen.
It's just a graveyard for ships.
I've been reading a book about the building of the Scottish lighthouses
and there was a reference in that to the Pentland Firth being known as "Hell's Mouth".
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please.
Would you please listen carefully to the following safety announcement?
"...violent and dangerous when the tidal stream is opposed by gales in the opposite direction."
In some ways, it puts into words the fears that you have underneath
about what's happening in the water, beneath the surface.
It just suggests to me, at certain times of day, that we just couldn't cover that stretch of water.
We'll have to rely on the wind blowing in a particular direction,
as well as the tide going in a particular direction, as well as the currents being right.
If any of them are not...you know, if any of these are out of sync,
I think we're in deep trouble and it would be impossible.
I've been across that stretch of water lots of times on the ferry, and even on the ferry you think,
"Wow, you know, is it possible? Could anybody swim this?"
I'm going to have a go.
I really, really am determined to do it, yes.
I've got to do it before I'm too old.
Turning to the left or what?
  Never mind under there!
  No, no, I think you need to get right up...
This is St Mary's and that's the pier, so we're on the end of that pier...
and I'm trying to see if I can see where this pier that he's going to swim to is.
See you in a bit then, Ros.
So he's still going further out, is he?
  He's going to swim across to the other pier.
  What? And no rescue boat or whatever?
He'll be all right in this. It's not very far.
  Would it be half a mile?
  Probably, yes.
You can have an initial body shock where you can't breathe and, you know,
you feel very uncomfortable in the water,
but the long term effect is the most dangerous and that's hypothermia.
Lots of people have to get pulled out because they don't know where they are and it's very dangerous.
Hypothermia can make you feel warm.
It gets so bad that people begin to feel comfortable in the water
and they don't really know that they're dying.
The one thing I've been able to do is withstand the cold,
but the problem is that once you're over 50,
your circulation starts to deteriorate.
Now, I'm beginning to feel it, you know, you feel it in your toes, your hands start to seize up,
so you swim like a claw, so you begin to realise that time's running out, you know,
so that's why you've got to do things while you still can.
Will you manage to reach down?
I don't know. You'll have to stand up.
Oh, aye, that's great.
Oh, God!
I'd said earlier in the day that I was going to try to do an hour,
but in my own mind, I'd secretly said,
"It'd be great if you could do an hour and a half, or two, and then, you know, you'll feel reassured."
He always says he feels much better after the first half hour or so,
or after the first hour he often says, "I didn't get into it for the first hour."
So he's probably just beginning to enjoy it now.
Whoo! How long is that?
  Three and a half hours.
  Three and a half?
  Yes.
  Oh, that's good.
  Hmm, how are you?
  Gee whizz.
Cold?
Aye, that was freezing.
  Well, well done, that was fantastic.
  That's a good measure, isn't it?
  Yes.
I can still talk, that's another good sign.
Of course, I really admire Frank.
When I see him in the water and when he swam the Channel, it was just unbelievable.
There he was for 16 and three quarter hours.
He never let up, he never slowed down, he never for a second lost his focus.
He was just swimming with everything in him, absolutely determined to do it,
and that's incredibly impressive, I really admire that.
And knowing that...
if it was at all possible, he was going to do it.
It's not like the English Channel,
where the water goes one way for so many hours
and another way for so many hours. You can account for that,
so if you get carried sideways for a few hours and the tide turns, you get carried back.
So you're going to end up where you want to go. Pentland Firth's not like that.
There are so many tidal streams and eddies.
Initially, I was astonished to think that anybody would try it.
In fact, I was quite concerned.
When Mungo spoke to me about someone swimming the Firth, I thought, "It's quite dangerous."
Depends if you can time it right, and how strong the ebb comes in,
you see, it'll go down that way and it'll start to carry you
a bit more that way, and further down, it'll carry you that way.
By the time you get across there, it will be ebbing.
It will be, and unless you're going to run across on the surface.
  Really?
  Yes. I guess it's... it doesn't stay slack and it's a long way.
We don't know how much help you're going to get from the tide   that's the problem.
Or how much hindrance you're going to get at the other side.
If he goes out north of the Lother, like, off the back of the creel,
he won't make it out by there.
The tide will pull you on top of the Lother because you can't swim fast enough to get it by there. No way!
You couldn't even row across there to clear the Lother.
  I came over there one day...
  Passed Swona?
  Heading this way.
..and I was doing 15.8 knots that way.
Gee whizz.
  There's a lot of tide there.
  Yes.
'It took Mungo months, I think, to work out how he might approach the swim.
'To be fair to both Mungo and Gordon, they were enthusiastic, but they didn't minimise the dangers.
'All the barriers that we might face were indeed placed in front of us
'and I think that first meeting really brought it home to us why no one had done this before.'
By the time you get down there, the tide will be carrying you down,
but once you get further down, you'll find that it's turning, and it's swinging round
and it'll start to push you back, which is ideal in a way, as it will be taking you back towards the land.
You don't want to be too far up that way when the ebb comes in, you want to be down there.
The tide's going to be your problem, how far you're going to be carried off course.
What's the sea temperature in the Channel?
Well, you'll laugh, it's 16 or 17, you know.
  It's a lot warmer, but I know that.
  That's almost about twice what it is here.
  I know that.
That's what I drink my coffee at.
When people get hypothermia, usually they swim in circles or they go backwards,
they don't know where they are
and what we'll do is, we'll work out some questions in advance that Ros can ask me,
like my telephone number or, you know, how many children I have,
  or what my wife's name is, all these sorts of things, and if I get it wrong...
  She'll leave you.
  She'll leave me in the water, yes.
  If you forget her name, you've had it.
OK, well, I'll speak to you about half past two
and we'll just... see how it's...flowing then, OK?
  How was your swim?
  Fantastic this morning.
  Was it good?
  Yes, it was really good.
  Was the water nice or...?
The wind is warm this morning, so it was much nicer being on the beach.
It was a bit wavy, but not bad, but there was a lot of seaweed.
He said tomorrow the wind's going to change and come from the south east, which is worse.
That's going directly against the tide that we'd be in,
he said, but Tuesday might be OK.
I thought I was ready to do the swim.
I'd prepared myself to cope with the temperatures, you know.
There was a phone call every night and then Gordon Wylie said,
' "Sorry, it's cancelled. The weather forecast means it's not on."
'Or, "The winds are going to be too high."
'Or, "I'm not prepared to take you out, it's too dangerous."
'So that was very frustrating for that first tide.'
Ah ha. OK. Look, thank you for that, that's...
You know, that's sort of drawing on your experience.
We need to know that.
Well, shall I phone you tomorrow? Oh, yes. No, I mean for Wednesday.
I mean for Wednesday. Phone you about this time for Wednesday?
He's just, he's down at Burwick
looking out, he says, it's absolutely hellish.
All the preparation was really for that first neap tide
and unfortunately the weather
just meant that every single day the swim was ruled out.
Hello, it's Frank here, how are you?
I'm just phoning to see whether you think there's any chance that we could go tomorrow.
Or, you know, what your views on that are.
He said there might be a chance on Thursday.
The tide will be stronger, which is a problem,
but the weather looks better.
But he said there will be four or five days on the next tide in two weeks, you know.
Bloody hell!
The longer you have to wait, the more frustrating it can be
and if you're coming to the end of a tide and there's one day left
and they say, "Well, shall we go or shall we not?"
you'd obviously want to take the risk, you know,
  even though the conditions might not be suitable.
  I think it was very difficult for him to deal with.
He was still not sure whether he would ever get the chance to try.
Because, as Gordon Wylie said,
there'll be at least one day in the year that you might be able to swim,
but the problem is we can't wait for 364 days to find out when that will be.
Waiting for the swim is one of the greatest occupational hazards of the swimmer.
It's almost like the tides and the weather throws it back in your face and says,
"How dare you think you can take us on."
You have to be psychologically able to wait and wait and wait
and wait just for that chance.
Some people, seemingly some of the fishermen,
have been talking on the radio about this crazy idea of swimming the Pentland Firth, you know,
had anybody ever heard of anything so ridiculous?
And yet others, the ferry pilots
and people who have bigger creel boats,
they think that it is eminently possible
and you just have to get the tides right,
but that doesn't explain why nobody's done it before.
If it was possible, I'm sure it would have been attempted more frequently.
This is at the slack water, this is the slackest it will be,
and you still see that turbulence going out there.
We've had to delay for nearly two weeks,
until there's another neap tide coming up
and we hope that we'll be able to make the attempt then.
In between, we've been doing lots of practice swims
and trying out the water, going out with the boat,
trying to swim in different conditions
and now we're narrowing down the place that we may...
be able to set off from.
From here, do you think?
Yes. Don't throw it too vigorously.
  Look at that buoy...
  Yes, look how it's pulling that buoy.
It's making a wake.
I wanted to see if the water would rush down past this headland because if it did rush down,
then you would know it would be unsafe to swim out from here,
or even to attempt to be dropped here.
But I'm going to talk to Mungo now and see if we can
do a trial swim from here, maybe tomorrow evening.
Storms have hit the north east of England, there's been flooding,
there's been torrential rain,
city centres have been under two feet of water and, um...
I'm just worried now that tomorrow, being Monday,
it's all going to catch up here
and it's going to be difficult to get out.
A whole year of training and not to have the chance, I mean,
that would be absolute torture.
If we don't do it this time, we'll have to wait another fortnight.
The temperature will maybe start dropping
and the darkness will be coming in.
We've really got to do it now or it's...back to the drawing board.
It's got Mungo's name and address.
It says,
"7th September 2008, declaration of indemnity.
"This is to certify that any swims undertaken by Frank Chalmers in the waters of Scapa Flow
"or the Pentland Firth with the assistance of Mungo Montgommery,
"including practice swims and attempts to cross the Pentland Firth,
"are being undertaken by Frank Chalmers at his own risk and that neither Mungo Montgommery,
"nor any others on board will be liable for any injury caused to Frank
"or to his death, should this result from any of his swims.
"Ros Bayley also declares that, should any injury to Frank arise,
"or should he die as a result of the swims,
"she will not hold Mungo Montgommery or anyone else on board
"during any of the swims responsible for this, should this occur."
Mungo phoned me and said Frank would like you to be on the boat
and what we want to do is have a trial run and see if we can clear the tide
that'd carry him past the Lother, which means aborting the swim,
because you would never get anywhere against the tide.
So we just set off in the afternoon
and went down to Bath Head and Frank went ashore.
When he starts a swim, if he's starting from the boat,
he's got to be able to first swim ashore
and then he's got to be able to swim out from the shore.
The idea was that on the Monday, he would see if he could swim out
fast enough to not get carried onto the rocks.
It was just the most fantastic day!
I mean, the sea was just glassy and the sun was warm,
so as we were sailing down, we were both just...
feeling desperate that he wasn't going to be able to swim on this day.
We both felt exactly the same about it but as far as we knew, there was no chance of it happening.
You know, so we were just there, we were just afternoon trippers out in the boat for a half hour swim.
I could see that he was just going all out for it.
I knew that what he was going to try and do was to swim so fast
and so well and so strongly
that somehow Mungo would agree to let him have a go.
It was all working absolutely perfectly just as, you know, we'd hoped it would.
He swam on and he swam on... and he swam on and he swam on
and then there just came this wonderful moment when Mungo said,
yes, you know... OK, you know, let him have a go.
But he said, "Don't tell Frank yet."
It was so exciting, it was just wonderful.
Are we past the Lother?
We're going all the way. See you in Scotland!
  I'll need a cup of tea or something then.
  On the hour.
On the hour.
Thank you, Mungo.
"See you in Scotland!" I think I said.
There's nothing nicer than being part of helping somebody
to achieve what they really want in life.
We didn't have the Vaseline he needs to put on,
we didn't have his energy drink.
We had all this food in the caravan that we were going to have on the big swim.
I just felt so proud of him and so full of love for him,
just knowing that, you know,
even if he was really cold and really hungry and, you know,
he didn't have the right things,
that wouldn't affect him in the slightest, he would just swim.
I come from Dundee and the school I went to had a swimming pool.
The swimming pool manager was also the secretary of an open water swimming club.
So once a year the kids at the school, if you were a good swimmer,
you were allowed to train up to swim the River Tay.
Suddenly you felt you could do anything.
To be able to swim across a freezing cold river for a mile,
when you're 12 or 13, you feel like, you know, nothing's impossible.
The great thing about open water swimming is that it's you against elements.
So you feel you're pitting yourself against the cold and the waves
and the wind and the currents and the tides and...
it's a real challenge.
You're actually out in the open, under the sun or the rain,
and it's all so exhilarating.
So when you come out, you feel refreshed and full of life.
I really think there's something magical about open water.
You have to be able to adapt your stroke, you have to read the water.
It's fantastic. You have to be at one with the water.
Well, the tide's stronger than the morn' but...
hopefully the tide will slacken off in about half an hour to three quarters of an hour.
It's pushing south east at the moment.
On some of the bigger swims, you know, you actually can swim along
and you see fish underneath you, you see right down deep to the sea bed.
You have to swim and untangle yourself from seaweed.
You're swimming alongside a boat, a safety boat,
so there's that umbilical cord between you and the outside world.
You're communicating quietly with the others on your boat.
They're just keeping an eye on you all the time to make sure you're safe.
Yes. It may be longer if you have another bit.
It's a very, very pure relationship that Ros and I have when she's on the boat
because although a lot of things go unspoken,
it's really reassuring to know that somebody is there
just looking out for you all the time.
Whoo!
  Right, fantastic.
  God, I feel the current.
Yes, and the swell, too.
Biscuit or banana?
  Wouldn't it be better with sugar in?
  Ah, sugar.
Yes. It's fine.
  Am I heading in the right direction?
  Yes.
  Just keep aiming for the sun.
  Yes.
And then, when I was swimming along,
I saw this flash a couple of times underneath me
and this was in quite deep water and I thought,
"Uh oh, what do orcas look like? What do killer whales look like?"
But then I saw these two beady eyes looking up at me and this seal
on its back, just swimming effortlessly underneath,
about six feet away, looking up, mirroring me.
I always feel that Frank's like a seal in the water
and then seeing them swimming alongside him,
they do look so like him with their round heads and those sleek bodies,
and just coming to look
and just being in touch with wild creatures like that is amazing.
In the Channel, or in any open water swims,
these rules are the same for everyone.
You're allowed to wear a normal swimming cap, normal trunks or costume and normal goggles.
So wetsuits aren't allowed and it means
that it's you against the cold water.
You can't buy your way to success. This is another great thing.
You can't buy the latest gear to give you an advantage.
You're not attached to the boat. In fact, if you touch the boat,
or hold onto the safety boat, you're disqualified.
It's basically you against the elements,
the way it has been for over 125 years.
You have to get into what they call a zone.
You have to detach yourself
because the cold and the pain in your muscles and, you know,
the isolation is so strange, you've actually got to detach yourself
and you be somewhere else.
So you forget about everything else going on around you.
You just focus on your swimming and, you know, the time between feeds...
It may take half an hour between each feed and it goes like five minutes.
And sometimes you do things like you count,
or you sing songs to yourself in your head.
I go over lots of different verses and I sing one or two
that I've written myself about swimming.
The problem is if you forget the words to your own songs,
that's a good indication that the cold is getting to you.
There's a tale that's passed down in myth and legend
Of a place that no one sees and lives to tell
Some say it's the entrance to Eden
And others the gateway to Hell...
..They say that the women are like mermaids
And the men are like gods down from on high
They're just never contented by their welcome
Or listen to their...
I kept looking round and sometimes I didn't really see all of the boat, you know.
If you're at the top of a swell or at the bottom of a swell, the boat had disappeared
and you could see the masts.
At other times I'd look round
and I could see the deck of the boat because it was tipping over,
you know, it might be a 30 degrees angle onto its side.
And that really felt like we were in a different sort of sea.
That before we'd been in a sea but now it felt like we were really in the ocean.
Frank was fine, he was swimming along
and the plan was still working and we could see Duncansby Head the whole time.
What we were waiting for was for the tide to turn
because the whole plan had been that he would swim down,
the tide would take him out to the east
and then the tide would turn and bring him back to the west.
So we were waiting and I kept... Well, I asked a few times,
Mungo, whether the tide had turned and how soon it would turn
and then he said, "It's late, it's later than we expected."
And then, you know, it hasn't started to come
and meanwhile we're going round in a sort of semicircle.
We've come south of the beginning of Scotland,
but we weren't getting any closer to it,
and then the worst of it was that the sun was coming down
and so we're moving round in an arc and the sun's coming down
and it was obvious that there was less and less chance that he would be able to do it.
  How are you doing?
  Well, I don't seem to be getting any nearer, do I?
The tide's soon going to help.
  You just have to swim a bit and then the tide will turn.
  Good.
  That will make it easier.
  Do you want some Mars Bar or a banana?
  No, thank you.
  Biscuit?
  What?
  Biscuit?
  No, no. Oh!
  Must keep swimming.
  Then we'll head for the lighthouse?
  Well, it's the headland.
  Aim for the headland?
And as the sun was getting low,
I could tell how quickly it would start to get difficult to see him.
You know, I began to realise that it wasn't going to happen.
I think I could see that Frank... had come to that conclusion.
I saw him looking round.
It was almost like he was expecting me to tell him to come in.
Mungo said, well, he and Willie had just been talking
and they decided that they'd come to that conclusion.
So then I just had to signal him...
..and at that point, I felt, you know...
I was... oh, you know, just felt so sad
and I just felt it just was, yes, so sad.
From that sort of high moment of certainty earlier in the day
and then to have to bring him in.
Frank!
It's going to get dark.
It's too far, Frank, too far.
  ..Chris Hoy and all. And congratulations to them.
That's all the sport from me tonight but this guy coming up also deserves a gold medal too.
  Thanks. Not often I get a compliment from you.
  Not you!
She means the swimmer from Dundee who's the first to cross the waters of the Pentland Firth.
Frank Chalmers set off from South Ronaldsay.
After almost four hours and eight miles,
he had reached Duncansby Head on the Scottish mainland.
But, unfortunately for Frank, it looks like his efforts won't be officially recognised. Why not?
Colin Wight reports.
'Orkney yesterday afternoon, and Frank Chalmers is preparing...'
It's the first time I've failed in any swim in my life.
I've never, ever had to come out, on the English Channel,
the Gulf of Corryvreckan, the Hellespont, Inner Hebrides,
you know, I've never not been successful.
So it's a new experience for me but it just shows you what the tides are like and the great thing is,
you know, the pilots, as far as they're concerned, I've made that crossing.
I don't regard it as a crossing because I didn't land,
but what I do think is that it opens the way up for other swimmers.
Anybody who's younger and faster than me should be prepared
to come and pick up that challenge.
I often wake up in the middle of the night thinking,
"I wonder if it's possible to swim across the River Tay on New Year's Day?"
and it made me think "Oh, there must be hundreds of lighthouses round Britain.
"People could swim to lighthouses."
That's what keeps me awake at night.
To be honest, if Mungo Montgommery and Willie Bremner phoned me up next year and said,
"We've been thinking, Frank, if we just start at a slightly different place
"and at a different time,
"then there's a chance that you can land on Scotland,
"you know, you can swim from one point of Orkney and land on the Scottish mainland."
How could I say no? I would have to go and try again.
Once round the Lido
Just try the water
It's only swimming
That's what they're singing
Don't try the Lido
Avoid the water
Or you'll be swimming around in circles all your life.
