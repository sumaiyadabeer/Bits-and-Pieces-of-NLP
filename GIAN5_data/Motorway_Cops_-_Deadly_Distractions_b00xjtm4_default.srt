Tonight, caught on camera.
As the motorway cops go trucking...
He's on the phone in front.
..to catch lorry drivers up to no good...
I can smell it on your breath.
Not only can I smell it on your breath, I can smell it on your skin.
Are you an alcoholic?
..the battle to free an injured woman...
and the results of a moment's distraction at the wheel.
Even at 50, 60 mph that's the damage it can cause.
You're on the phone and look up and suddenly realise the traffic has stopped
and next thing you know, you're parked in somebody's rear end.
Britain's 2,000 miles of motorway
are some of the busiest roads in Europe.
Hundreds of thousands of cars, vans and lorries
use them every day.
But busy roads and a desire to get from A to B ever faster can be a dangerous combination.
There's a vast difference
between driving on a normal A or B road
to driving on a motorway
because of the speeds involved.
or flicking open a bag of crisps or opening a can of pop or anything like that,
on a motorway can be catastrophic.
The hub of the motorway network is in the Midlands,
a pinch point where the traffic can bunch up causing congestion.
Motorway cops Chris Perry and Chris Clarke are joining the traffic to head towards an emergency call out.
We've been sent to a road traffic accident.
It appears to be several vehicles involved.
Large goods vehicles, there's some suggestion
that the cab's come off one of them so it could be quite serious so we need to get there ASAP.
Accidents involving heavy goods vehicles are PC Perry's worst fear.
What's going through your head is, what injuries have we got?
Because when HGVs are involved, there's big collisions.
There he is here on the end.
Hey!
As they pass the accident scene on the southbound carriageway...
Oh dear, that's a bit of a mess, isn't it?
..all three lanes appear to be blocked
and the fire services and ambulance crews have only just arrived.
Frustratingly, the cops have to carry on another mile to the next junction to turn around...
as well as coping with drivers slowing for a closer look.
That's your typical rubbernecking.
As they make the turn up the southbound carriageway, the full effect of the crash can be seen.
A three mile tailback forces the cops to take to the hard shoulder.
Yeah, we're just up with them now. Show us the TA.
As we arrived I could see in lane one an articulated lorry
and across lane two, at a bit of an angle,
I could see what looked like the box section of a rigid goods vehicle which is dipping down at the front.
The force of the impact has completely ripped the back of the box van from the driver's cab.
The trailer of the 44 tonne articulated lorry has suffered some damage
but it's nothing compared with what's happened to the front of the other lorry,
a smaller and lighter vehicle.
So I walked round the front
and just saw utter devastation.
The whole of the passenger side, the near side, had been completely ripped to shreds.
You're thinking the worst.
Potentially we've got a fatal accident here.
Looking at the mess that was there,
there was a very, very good chance that there were severe if not fatal injuries.
  How are they getting on?
  Hi, you all right?
  You all right?
  We've got one male off of this, the driver of this.
Adamant he doesn't want to travel to hospital.
Out exchanging details when fire's has got here.
  What, has he got any injuries?
  None.
  No injuries?
  No injuries. He's an exceptionally lucky man to have walked away from that.
PC Perry has seen some lucky escapes in his time but the driver of this truck may be the luckiest yet.
I mean, it's amazing, this guy, he's lost the whole lot,
he's lost the cab, you know, he needs to buy himself a lottery ticket.
I'm astonished that he's got out of that without even a scratch.
The driver was saved because the impact was on the passenger side
and fortunately there was no one in the passenger seat.
In a lot of circumstances, you get passengers travelling in these things.
If you look at the state of this headrest,
well, that would have taken whoever's it was head off.
You can see
from some of the marks on the seats of the passenger seat
of how some of the metal has literary sliced through the seat.
So if bodies had been there, you know, a human being, then...
we'd have been talking fatalities.
But even at the driver's point of view,
how he's got out of that non injured because nothing's been moved here.
The first thing the driver of the artic knew of the impact was when the box van hit him from behind.
I was just coasting to a stop and all of a sudden,
I accelerated with a big bang and hit the gentleman in front.
Because I knew my foot was on the brake because I was coming to a stop
but all of a sudden he just accelerated
and I just couldn't work out what was happening at the time.
I looked out my window, I could just see the gentleman in this truck here
and he was in one piece.
But what isn't clear is why the box van failed to slow with the rest of the traffic.
There's never such thing as an accident.
They're caused for a reason, either mechanical or driver error.
Driver error is the greatest cause.
Until they've talked to everyone involved, including the box van driver, who failed to stop in time
and who's now in the back of PC Clarke's car, the cops won't have a complete picture.
More than 60 people are killed in goods vehicle accidents each year.
To reduce the death toll, truckers are required by law to take regular breaks.
Making sure they're doing so is PC Angus Nairn.
It's like a cat and mouse game.
They're trying to avoid me when they come down the motorway and I'm trying to find them.
What they seem to forget is I do this job for a living,
I do it day in and day out,
they only might meet me once
but I stop those trailers numerous times and you keep getting offences.
Today, he and his fellow motorway cops have combined forces with VOSA,
the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency in a country wide operation.
Checking up on the drivers requires specialist knowledge
and PC Nairn probably knows more than most about trucks, truckers and the tricks they pull.
I used to be in the haulage industry before I became a police officer so it gives me that edge
over drivers who think they can flout the law and fiddle with their drivers' hours, etc.
Today's operation will check every last detail
and those who fail the tests won't be travelling any further.
PC Nairn has teamed up with traffic examiner, Hazel Lloyd.
We're doing a joint operation, Hazel who works for VOSA and myself, are working as a pair,
we're out here on the M6 motorway trying to find trucks that have committed offences.
They're looking for likely targets and he thinks he's spotted one.
There's an Irish truck, it's obviously coming down from the ferry
and I thought, there's a good chance that he's driven over the hours that he should be
and I want to stop them there
because the drivers have got a pressure on them to get to destinations by certain times
and they tend to break the rules, the driving hours, to get there.
Every heavy goods vehicle is fitted with a tachograph which records how much rest the driver has taken.
So we'll just be taking him into the check site
to make sure that his documents are all in order for his tachograph, etc.
PC Nairn and Traffic Examiner Lloyd have brought the lorry
to the vehicle examination yard at Perry Bar just north of Birmingham.
  Hello. You all right?
  Hiya there. Not too bad, yourself?
  Yes, are you?
  I've seen you before, haven't we?
  Aye, probably, yeah.
I'd like to have a look at your paperwork, please.
  Yeah.
  I need your authorisation for the company, driving licence and your tachographs.
All right. I'm just going to take these into the office.
  Oh, aye.
  Have you got your driving licence with you?
No, I haven't, just I took this here.
  For this week just.
  You've got your passport.
  Hazel?
  Yeah?
  Do you have a licence?
  I'll just do a quick check on it.
  Just a passport.
  Thanks.
The driver's failure to carry his licence with him is making PC Nairn suspicious.
Whilst we were speaking to the driver,
I'd checked on his driver's licence status with the control room,
who check DVLA's database and there was no record of him
on the DVLA database for the UK of having a licence.
Which is a fair thing because of the fact it was an Irish truck.
Now Lloyd's found another problem.
His driving hours.
Yes, I've got a daily rest offence.
From ending his duty yesterday until starting again in the early hours of this morning,
he's had only seven hours and 24 minutes rest, the minimum he needed was nine.
So yes, we have an offence.
  Hiya.
  Hello.
  Yes, yes...
  Can I just talk to you about your charts?
  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Problem I've got is that between you finishing yesterday and you starting again last night,
in the early hours of this morning, you've only had seven hours.
  But, er...
  It's not enough daily rest.
  See this here, right?
  Did you sleep yesterday?
  Oh, aye, yes.
  You slept on the ferry?
  Yeah, and I slept here.
And you slept for not quite two hours this morning?
Yeah. I stopped for about an hour and 50 minutes.
I intend to learn this as much as I can...
But PC Nairn reckons the driver should know the drill already.
'Drivers always try it on, but when they tell you they don't know what they're doing,
'that's when I start disbelieving them.'
While PC Nairn tries to get to the bottom of the problem,
further north on the M6, at the scene of the accident
involving two lorries and a car, the traffic has started moving again.
While the backlog clears, the cops continue to investigate who caused the crash.
Sergeant Steve Robinson has now taken charge and is being briefed by PC Clarke.
It appears   this is the Volkswagen   it's obviously run into the back of this artic,
and the cab's gone right through, and basically it's taken the box off the back of the chassis.
Now, with an accident of that nature, even though there was nobody injured,
I started to form the opinion that offences had been committed.
So I need to make sure that all of the drivers have been spoken to,
that they're interviewed, that we can get an indication
of exactly what's happened.
The cops might have been able to find a clue in the box van's tachograph,
but it's been destroyed in the crash.
However, all the evidence points to the driver of the box van as the person at fault.
And he's in the back of PC Clarke's car.
How did the collision occur?
Tell me one sentence at a time, I've got to write it down, yeah?
I was just travelling down here and they all jammed their anchors on,
next I jammed mine on and I was a bit close, I had to pull out and clipped the side of the cab.
The driver's story is that the traffic stopped suddenly, but other motorists tell it differently.
  I take it you were slowing down nice and slowly, were you?
  Yeah.
  It's wasn't a...
  Yeah, because... I've spoken to this guy,
and he just said, "Oh, yeah, you were slowing down, in another second we would have been stopped."
So you used a nice, steady, controlled slowdown? Well, that's it, then.
  Yeah.
  You didn't brake hard or anything like that?
No, we were literally just... I had loads of gap to the next car.
It looks like the box van driver had plenty of time to stop but for some reason failed to do so.
Have you suffered any mechanical defects with the vehicle?
Not really, no.
Sergeant Robinson now has an idea of the sequence of events.
What I had established at the scene was that the articulated vehicle had actually stopped.
It was as a result of the collision between the rigid goods vehicle
that had run into the back of the articulated vehicle,
which then pushed that articulated vehicle into the rear of the Cavalier.
It's crunch time for the box van driver.
Whose fault was the accident, and why?
Must be mine, mustn't it?
He knew he'd shown
a lack of attention and he'd caused the accident.
The driver of the cab, that's been very lucky and very fortunate,
for some reason, hasn't braked until the very last minute,
so he's been doing something, and clearly, from our point of view,
he's driving without due care and attention.
Not only could he have killed himself or others,
other passengers in his vehicle, he could have killed any other members of the public on the road.
And that's extremely dangerous. And that shows you, like, a moment of inattention,
even at 50, 60 mph, that's the damage it can cause.
Lack of attention is the cause of nearly 40% of accidents every year.
My bag's not turned up, has it?
  Your bag?
  Yeah.
  You can have a look, mate.
  You told your bosses?
  Yeah, yeah...
We'll do that, then.
Just bear with us a minute. The driver was, I think, still in shock.
I don't think he realised the sheer gravity of what had actually happened,
of how lucky he was.
I think it was only when he looked back at his cab
and realised that he might not have been actually going home that night.
Clearly, it's quite a shocking incident.
It's an incident that you probably would only ever be involved in once in your lifetime,
and the scene was actually quite devastating,
so I think that would have quite a big impact on any individual,
that one moment you can be OK, the next moment, total devastation.
At Perry Barr in north Birmingham, the lorry driver caught exceeding
his driving hours is being grounded by VOSA examiner Hazel Lloyd.
  Effective from now...
  Yes?
  I'm going to put you on nine hours' rest, OK?
  Yes.
I'll ask you to park in the lay by just outside there, all right?
  Right.
  If I can just bring this to your attention.
If you do decide to drive off, if you see an opportunity and we're not looking...
I'll hardly bother for that, now!
Meanwhile, PC Angus Nairn is using the time
to make some more inquiries into the man's missing driving licence.
There was something in the back of my mind that just didn't sit easily with me.
There was something there that I had to find out about.
I had to do a bit more digging.
I had to get to the bottom of the fact.
What was really wrong here?
I'm not given up yet. I'm going to make an inquiry with the Garda, to see if he's got the licence
that he needs, because we've got no record of him in the UK and there's not a Northern Irish one, so...
He says she's got a Southern Irish licence. I'll check that just now.
Don't know how he's got a Southern Irish licence when he lives in the north, right enough.
But we'll find it.
He was claiming that he had a Southern Irish driver's licence
and he'd held this licence for a couple of years.
So the first phone call was going to be to the Garda in the South of Ireland,
just to find out, did they have a record of this lad?
'I have only...three matches.
'None of them match the name, first name,
'and none of them match the date of birth.'
That's no problem. Thanks for looking.
After drawing a blank with the Southern Irish driver's licence,
I then contacted the Northern Irish Driver's Licence Agency.
Fantastic. Thanks again, Graham. Cheers, pal. Bye now.
And they confirmed the suspicions that I'd had for some time.
  Hazel?
  Yes?
  My man, Padraig.
  Yes?
  He's only a provisional licence holder.
  Really?
And in Northern Ireland.
So, Northern Ireland and the UK are the same thing, so provisional licence holder, full stop.
It beggars belief to think that he's got the nerve to drive that truck up and down the motorway
and the roads in Britain, putting everybody's life in danger, when he's never even sat a test.
So...I'll wake him up in a wee while
and give him that news and I'll deal with him the way he should be dealt with,
the way that I was looking to deal with him earlier on
but just couldn't get enough evidence and information.
But now I've got it I can now go ahead and prosecute him the way I was intending to.
Two hours later, PC Nairn is about to give the lorry driver who has no licence a rude awakening.
I'm about to go and waken him up out of his beauty sleep
and tell him that he's going to have to get his things together
because he ain't going to be driving this truck away from here.
There's a large number of drivers that don't have the proper licence to drive trucks.
Drivers will try and blag their way into a job.
They might well be able to drive the truck but they're daft enough to actually put people's lives at risk
by jumping into the driver's seat of one of these trucks and bimbling off down the road,
blissfully unaware that if they were to kill somebody,
or be involved in an accident where somebody was seriously injured,
they're looking at custodial sentences.
  Have you had some sleep now?
  Oh, aye, yes.
We'll get this whole thing sorted out.
We're getting it sorted out   there's good news and bad news. What do you want first?
  Give me both. It doesn't matter.
  I'll give you the good news.
  You don't have to wait for your nine hours' prohibition.
  Yes?
  You can go home any time.
  So that's the good news.
  Right.
The bad news is you'll not be driving the truck.
  Yeah, but see...
  But see, but see... I've got a thing here that tells me
that you don't have a licence.
You don't have a licence to drive a truck or a licence to drive a car.
You've a provisional, but that means you've got to have L plates and a supervisor.
Have you ever sat a test to drive a truck?
  Yeah, I have.
  Where?
  In Recess and Dundalk. I have done that.
Right, well, the South don't have any record at all of you.
I don't know how this thing's happened.
And you don't come up as having a record in the South of Ireland for a driver's licence.
But that's beside the point because, in the North, you're only a provisional licence holder.
Only last year you were given six points.
  I'm going to give you even more because you're going to have to go to court.
  Right.
Right? And the six you've got, and then the rest I'm going to give you,
because it'll be six for driving without insurance,
  and another three for driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.
  Yes.
  But I'm satisfied at the minute that you're going no further with this truck.
  Yes.
The driver wasn't arrested for the offence because it's not an arrestable offence,
to be driving without a licence for either a car or a track, unfortunately.
If it was an arrestable offence then we'd maybe get some more people off the road,
prevent a lot more accidents from happening
and save you and I a lot of money in our expensive insurance premiums.
The truck is being driven to the pound where it will remain until
a qualified driver is available to continue the journey south.
At night time, traffic on the motorway network is often much lighter than during the day.
Most of the heavy lorries have parked up for the night leaving the roads to the cars and vans.
But the motorway at night has its own problems
and tired drivers are one of the major worries for the motorway cops.
It's 3am and PCs Jess Rojek and Gary Williams have been called to an accident near Stoke on Trent.
We've just had a report that there's a vehicle overturned on the M6 southbound between 14 and 13.
There are a couple of crews in attendance, they've just got there and updated the control room.
It would appear it's on its roof and a person is trapped.
It would also appear that there's an ambulance on the scene at the moment.
We don't know what the state the casualties are in.
I dare say we'll get an update in a moment as to whether it will be serious.
We will have to go there reasonably quickly to get there
in the best possible time.
The cops don't routinely drive at high speed
but the crash is more than 40 miles away
and the emergency crews on scene need all the help they can get.
It was one of my first blue light runs that I'd done
since coming onto motorway,
and it was fast, it had to be fast.
When you are driving at those speeds you have to remain calm and focused.
You are aware of the consequences, if you lose concentration even for a second.
Just that one lack of judgment can destabilise the car.
It's quite draining when you get to the end of it.
A further update is now coming through on the radio.
'I'm told it's a female pedestrian,
'who was walking down the carriageway.
'I have got an ambulance on scene and am trying to get some more information
'as to what's been going on. OK, thank you.'
From what I've just caught,
it sounds like there was a breakdown.
Somebody's been walking up the hard shoulder,
presumably to get to an emergency phone,
and another car has struck the pedestrian...
..which means there's a good chance the injuries are going to be either fatal
or, um, life changing.
At that point, I didn't know if it was a fatality or not
and that's what I was thinking, this is going to be a fatal collision.
We need to get there to try and save lives.
I'm not sure if this particular stretch of carriageway is lit on not.
As you can see, we've just gone into an unlit carriageway.
If the vehicle is dark, it's on its roof in the carriageway,
yet people have been driving for some time, they're tired
they don't see it till the last minute or they don't see it at all,
what is a one vehicle RTC may well become three or four.
If we get something like a truck hitting it,
then we can be looking at an altogether bigger collision.
There it is.
There was one vehicle that was overturned,
the fire crew was there working on it
which again lends itself to the fact it may be a serious injury or fatal.
From what we saw it looked a pretty nasty scene.
The motorway cops' priority is to ensure the safety of rescue crews
who are working on the unlit carriageway just feet from the traffic.
We're going to close lane two as well.
The first thing we have to do when we get there is make the scene safe,
regardless of who's screaming and shouting.
In fact it's good if people are screaming and shouting because you know they're still alive.
It's when the scene is deathly quiet that you start to worry.
While the cops close off lane two, the fire brigade are busying try to
cut free a woman passenger from the wreckage of her car.
PC Rojek has been a motorway cop for just four months and sticks close to PC Williams.
With every job that I'm going to on the motorway,
it's all new.
There is lots to learn. Luckily I've got Gaz
who guides me through it all.
When we got to the scene I was thinking that potentially
there was still going to be serious injury or a fatality involved in this collision.
There was just one car actually overturned and damaged as far as we could see at that stage.
It may well be something as simple as the driver's fallen asleep
or lost control of the car or swerved to avoid something.
The vehicle has obviously spun round and overturned.
More than 20 fire fighters are on scene led by watch manager, Ian Moss.
As soon as I made contact with the ambulance personnel I was informed that there was one female casualty,
going downhill rapidly in the passenger side.
But the woman in the car is not the only casualty.
There is also, I believe at this stage, an injured pedestrian.
She has actually driven past this overturned car here.
She's been walking back to see if everybody is OK
and whilst she's been walking back down the hard shoulder towards this car,
she's then been taken out by another car who was trying to avoid the overturned car.
It turned out that there was more to it.
There was a lorry parked further down which had been involved in the collision.
While the fire crew battled to cut the woman free, the cops still have
to solve the mystery of who's to blame for the accident.
40 miles south in Birmingham city centre, PCs Martin Smith
and Simon Breckles are halfway through their 12 hour shift.
They're parked up just off the motorway looking out for suspicious cars.
As we were sitting waiting for traffic to pass,
there was a Golf which brought our attention.
It was an old car.
Are we after this Volkswagen then?
We might as well check in, it looks a bit of a tatty heap, doesn't it?
I'll run that through and check it for insurance.
Oscar Tango nine six...
They know the drivers of tatty heaps often don't bother about details like insurance.
  'May I report no insurance.'
  Ah ha!
  'MoT expired 19th August.'
  Ho ho!
It's going to be a code one on Bagot Street in the city centre.
The reason why we stopped this one,
it looked like a bit of an old banger.
We checked it out on the PNC and it's got no insurance and the MoT's expired.
So we're going to have a chat with the driver and see what he's got to say for himself.
He'll probably protest he's a trader.
That's what we're getting now.
  People are getting stopped...
  Do you want to take a seat in there.
  Hello, mate, how are you doing?
  Not bad, how are you?
  Yes, not too bad. Has my colleague said why you've been stopped?
  Um, insurance?
There's a couple of things really, OK?
No insurance and no MoT.
OK? So, we're going to ask you straight up now to save us going round the houses
and making phone calls and keeping you here for ever, are you insured?
  OK. And the MoT has run out?
  Yes.
A lot of people do cough because they know full well
that once we check on the police national computer the vehicle comes back with no insurance.
It doesn't take an awful lot to find out the vehicle is not insured.
We'll keep it nice and simple. The facts are going to be reported.
You may be prosecuted for the offence of
using a vehicle with no insurance and an out of date MoT.
The downside to it is we have powers to seize vehicles from uninsured or unlicensed drivers.
You are uninsured so the vehicle will be seized. OK?
You know the risks, you took the chance, you came out in it
and it's just unfortunate that you got captured driving.
It's not his lucky night.
But he's holding no grudges.
You guys are so much nicer than...other police guys.
I don't know what your experiences are in the past, obviously, but we try and do the right thing.
We try and be fair and reasonable.
We've got no reason to be anything but...
It is my fault, and I'm not going to deny it.
It's my fault but you're being nice about it. That's what I appreciate.
We're not going to go over the top here. What does it achieve?
Nothing at all. You've done it, you've been caught out.
We're doing the paperwork, we'll be nice to you and you'll be gone.
But, the nice cops are still going to take his car away.
  Can I just get a couple of things out of the car?
  Yes, yes.
Absolutely no problem at all.
  What do you want and I'll go and get it for you?
  Can I get it myself?
He's OK to get it, just go with him, he'll be all right.
There's no suggestion the driver will make a run for it,
but PC Breckles is making sure.
Just in case.
If you want to leave it, leave it.
'Whilst he's going back to the police vehicle,
'I just glance into the back seat.'
Take your seat again, fella.
  Rather than pull up outside your door, do you want us to drop you somewhere near your house?
  Yeah.
But the pleasant atmosphere is about to be broken.
'In the back seat is a baseball bat.'
What's this for, fellow?
It's been in there for days, for ever.
Honestly, it's nothing of the sort you're thinking.
That was on the back seat.
Baseball bats are for baseball.
If he was playing baseball,
we'd accept anything he'd say.
If he was in the middle of a football pitch, in the middle of an open bit of grass land, anything like that.
He could say, "I was playing baseball" and we'd have no way of saying otherwise.
Why do you carry it on the back seat?
Someone moved it from the thingy to the back seat.
  From the where?
  From the boot.
  Why?
It always in my car.
Why is it in the car?
  Self defence, probably.
  Self defence?
Self defence is the wrong answer.
I think we're just about to compound your misery.
You said it's in there for self defence, mate.
  You're under arrest.
  Really?
Yes, suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.
You've just told us it's self  defence. You can't carry it, mate.
In the middle of Birmingham City Centre,
in a car which is not insured and you've got a baseball bat sitting on the back seat.
Oh, no, come on, man. I've never got in a fight in my life.
You've just told me that's for self  defence. It's an offensive weapon.
You're always going to get arrested, especially if you say, "It's for self defence".
You've got no excuse to have a baseball bat for self defence.
We'll have to do the formalities.
  Oh...
  We've got to arrest you now. That's why I said, "Why is it in the car? You said, "Self defence."
This is a joke. I've never been in a fight in my life.
Honestly, swear to God.
You're under arrest on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.
When I said, "What's it for?"
You said, "Self defence, I suppose."
When you say that, that puts it into a whole different ball game.
It's being treated as an offensive weapon because if you're saying
self defence it means you're going to be using it to hit somebody with.
One of the best forms of self  defence sometimes is to just run away.
  You've been a bit of a fool to yourself, haven't you?
  I didn't realise that...
I'd rather not to have done that to you.
  I've never...
  What the hell do you carry something like that in your car for?
Just it's been in my case, it's a gift from a friend
from years ago. It's always in my car.
I've got to act on what you said.
I didn't know you guys were strict like that.
As his car is taken away, back on the M6 rescue workers are still
trying to free the woman passenger trapped in an overturned car.
While they cut her out, PC Williams has been working out what may have caused the crash.
As events unfolded, the initial reports we were getting
was that the driver of the overturned vehicle had started to fall asleep.
The passenger in that vehicle had actually seen that,
grabbed the wheel and the vehicle had gone out of control
to such an extent that it overturned and came to rest on the carriageway.
It was the first in a horrifying sequence of events.
What had happened is another vehicle had gone past the overturned vehicle,
obviously the driver saw it there, and it was a lady driving that vehicle.
She'd stopped on the hard shoulder and started to walk back to the overturned vehicle.
At which point, another car comes down, um,
over reacts to what's in the carriageway, and spins out of control.
The car starts veering, it goes onto the hard shoulder, hits the lady that's walking back to the car,
and we've now got another casualty to deal with.
The woman who stopped to help miraculously escaped with just a broken leg.
Seconds later, a lorry was also involved
and PC Williams thinks the driver may be able to shed more light on events.
Obviously, I was coming around the bend, I was following another Royal Mail artic.
  Right, OK.
  He's done a violent swerve to the right.
  Right.
I've gone, "What's he doing?"
  You couldn't see it because it was on its roof.
  Yeah, and it's dark as well.
  I've gone to swerve, I looked that side but there was a car alongside so I couldn't move.
  Yeah.
I've gone, "What is it?" and then bang.
There's actually been a couple of collisions as a result of what's happened here tonight.
The guy that I was dealing with was one of the drivers of the artic
convey that was coming down.
Basically, he's done his best to miss this one that's overturned
but unfortunately he's clipped it and spun it round
while the people were still trapped in it.
You couldn't write something like that.
Unless people see it they probably wouldn't believe it.
Although the car has been badly damaged in the crash, the driver is unhurt and on the way to hospital.
The woman passenger is not so lucky.
There's been a lot of cutting done to the car.
We've had to remove the passenger side door,
go in through the back of the car and remove the back seats
and do further cutting so she could come out on the spine board.
For everyone the events have been a shocking reminder of the potential dangers of the motorway.
The woman survivor, now on her way to hospital, has had an incredible escape.
It's just amazing that nobody's been killed.
Everybody's out, everybody's talking, everybody's alive, that's a good result.
I'm just glad that nobody's dead.
By daybreak, the motorway is already getting busy as the truckers take to the roads.
But amongst the early risers today are two motorway cops in a secret weapon.
A seven tonne lorry cab driven by PC Angus Nairn
who's on a special operation with his colleague PC Steve Gamble.
Today we're using this truck as part of Operation Parochial.
It's an operation that we do from time to time to catch truck drivers, van drivers,
anybody that happens to be committing the offence of using a mobile phone,
driving without due care and attention,
watching the TV whilst they're driving along the road,
things that you wouldn't normally see if you were in a normal police patrol car.
Because truckers are so high off the ground,
officers in ordinary police cars simply can't see in to check on what they're up to.
Things that you don't normally get to see from an unmarked car
that we can actually see from the truck.
As we drive along, what we're looking for is people who are on the phone,
people who are distracted when they're driving
and then we use the other lads in the intercept car behind us,
we call them up, they come along and they stop the vehicle
that we've video ed using the camera   Steve has.
The intercept team of PC Steve Sampson and Steve Rounds hangs back.
PC Rounds knows the stakes are high.
If the driver of a car is looking down into their lap
because they're texting,
then they'll hit the back of the car in front.
But with a truck,
it not only hits the back of the car in front,
it drives over it and the next four cars ahead.
The cops are already gathering lots of evidence on tape.
We can in a way sneak up on people and catch them red handed.
Some people might criticise the fact that we are using a truck
but only those people that are doing something wrong are the ones that complain.
Quite rightly they've got a reason to complain because they get penalty points and a big fine from us.
They're going to hate us, hate us with a vengeance.
That just makes the job a bit more satisfying when we know that we've made their day.
Just give him a warning. HORN TOOTS
I suppose you could regard it as a spy in the cab because we are spying straight into their cab.
The spy in the cab is clearly a surprise to many truckers.
I was just checking a message, that was all.
On the steering wheel, his dinner.
He's on the phone, Sarge.
Too late for the smile.
You learn the hard way, don't you? I've just learnt the hard way.
People might say, "It's a waste of time,
"it's a waste of money"
but when we can prove we're catching people doing really bad things,
and serious offences that could cause serious injury to somebody,
we can turn around and say, "That's the reason we're doing it."
20 miles north on the M6, PCs Martin Smith and Simon Breckles
are also targeting drivers who are not paying attention to the road ahead.
They're using an unmarked car to catch motorists using their mobile phones.
The M6 motorway is renowned for being stop/start. One minute it's flowing,
the next minute traffic comes to a grinding halt,
there's no obvious reason for that and all of a sudden you're faced
with three lines of standing traffic in front of you.
The moment's inattention will come when you're on the phone,
you'll look up and suddenly realise that the traffic has stopped
and the next thing you know you're parked in somebody's rear end.
He's on his phone.
  In the blue van?
  Yeah.
Brilliant, well done.
Is he off it now or still on it?
  He's off it now.
  Off it now. Well, tough.
Last year in the UK, nearly 170,000 drivers were guilty of using their phones whilst driving.
No excuses, no quarter for people on the phone, I'm afraid.
People know it's against the law.
They've known that for some time,
yet people persistently use a mobile phone
and the message possibly hasn't got across as effectively as it should.
Some people never learn, another one on the phone.
To me, that's a pet hate.
I will deal with it and deal with it robustly.
People will get tickets and they will go to court.
They'd no reason to believe it'd be anything other than the standard,
"You're on the phone, OK, there's your ticket, three points gone."
Little did we know it was going to turn into a saga.
The reason why we stopped you, do you have any idea?
  Um...go on.
  Take a stab in the dark.
What was you doing just?
  Driving?
  With what?
What was in your right hand?
  Nothing.
  Mobile telephone.
  There wasn't.
  Your mobile phone was to your ear.
  Do you have it with you, sir?
  Sorry?
  Where's your phone now?
Phone, in the van.
  Whereabouts in the van?
  In the ... down the side, I believe.
  So if we get your phone, it won't show anything happening on it, will it?
  Shouldn't do.
Because we've got the power to seize the phone as evidence of an offence.
So we're just asking you to be honest with us now.
We've seen you on the phone.
I was checking the time.
  Checking the time?
  Yes.
PC Smith's calling time on that excuse.
A Vito has a clock on the dashboard.
It does but it's an hour forward.
I couldn't work it out. I don't normally drive this vehicle.
And now he's thinking on his feet and the excuses and going from,
"No, I wasn't" to, "Well, maybe I was doing something".
If it's an hour forward, you know you're an hour behind.
I just realised it's an hour forward, you see.
I thought, I can't be that late because I don't normally drive this vehicle.
  I'll go and grab the phone.
  Yeah.
You can't tell the time on a phone by holding it to your right ear.
It doesn't work like that. You look at it.
  Even then, when you've got the phone in your hand, you're not focusing on what you're doing.
Doesn't matter what element of the phone you're using,
  so long as you're interacting with that phone.
  I understand that.
So he's agreed he's got his phone with him and he's agreed that he was doing something
with the phone although he wouldn't accept that it was a phone call.
  He's confessed to having his mobile phone on him?
  He's saying it was in his hand.
Yes, it was in my hand. I'll hold my hands up to that.
It was rankling me that we'd seen him on the phone,
yet we couldn't find evidence of the phone in the van.
Where do you think you threw it, then?
Down the side, that's where I thought I put it.
  You must have thrown it... in which case...
  It must have fell out the car.
I don't think it's fallen out of the car because we'd see it underneath.
  So it's a mystery, especially if you don't know the number.
  I don't normally use it.
  Do you mind if I go and see if I can find your phone for you?
  Sure.
  You don't object to that?
  No.
  OK. While my colleague speaks to you.
It would be interesting to know because you need to know where it's gone, don't you?
While PC Smith tries to solve the mystery of the missing phone,
PCs Angus Nairn and Steve Gamble are using the spy in the cab to trap truckers on the phone.
Unlike PC Smith, they've got the evidence on video to back up what they've seen.
He's on the phone in front, can you get him in the mirror?
  This one?
  Yep.
Tell me when, Steve, and I'll beep the horn.
Pip the horn, so he looks.
He looked across and, lo and behold,
instead of being shocked to see police officers filming him,
he took his other hand off the steering wheel and gave us a thumbs up.
So he's driving along with no hands at all on the steering wheel.
But we were quite shocked that he didn't realise who we were because we were in uniform
and we were videoing him but he continued using the phone
and, normally, a driver would see the police and their reaction would be utter shock
and put the phone down straight away.
Just edge forward again. He's definitely on the phone.
It's time to call in the cavalry.
If you want to move up,
it's, um, alongside us now.
Yes, no problem, mate. The red one in front of you?
  Yes, yes.
  We'll move up to you anyway...
in case we get an opportunity.
If the trucker didn't know he was in trouble before, he does now.
The fact the driver remained on his phone worries PC Nairn.
He's that busy concentrating on his phone call, there's no way he can be aware of what's going on around him.
And if somebody needs to stop in a hurry,
then if he doesn't see it happening, he's going straight into the back of them.
Then Steve and myself will then be sent up there to deal with an accident that
could have been avoided because he should have been paying more attention.
So I have no sympathy for him. He's going to get what he deserves, these points on his licence and a fine.
Come and have a seat.
Have a seat in the car for me.
Have a seat in the police car.
Have a seat in the police car, please.
  Yeah, OK, can I just get my phone?
  Yeah.
The driver seems to have forgotten something.
When the driver went back to the cab,
what he did was stand on the steps on the driver's side.
He seemed to linger a bit, and that's odd.
He seemed to be messing for what seemed like an age,
was probably 15 20 seconds, in the cab.
Come out the way.
I'm afraid you can't stand round the side of the truck fannying around.
Now have a seat in the police car.
All right? You're standing on the dangerous side of the traffic
with your truck door open and I want to have a word with you about your phone.
Have a seat in there, please.
The trucker's odd behaviour is making PC Rounds suspicious.
Hello, driver.
Now, driver, I don't know what you're trying to do but you're putting yourself and us in danger.
I don't want to stand on the hard shoulder of the motorway waiting for you to mess around in your cab.
  Sorry.
  When I say I want to speak to you in the police car, I want to speak to you in the police car
to keep you safe, to keep me safe, and so that we can talk in a nice quiet atmosphere. All right?
I just got this smell coming from the back of the car,
floating over the headrest towards me.
I was on the phone.
  Have you got your licence at all?
  Yes.
  With you?
Well, in the lorry. Do you want me to get it?
No, you've spent enough time looking around by the lorry.
  I had it on the passenger side.
  Stay here, talk to my colleague.
Where is your licence, and I'll go and fetch it.
In the...
Oh, God...
I can't remember where it is.
Well, you were going to fetch it. You're not instilling me with any confidence, driver.
In the...
Can I go and get it, it'll be just as easy.
Right, give me the keys, and I'll nip back and get it.
PC Rounds is taking the opportunity to have a look around the cab to see what the driver was up to.
  Is the vehicle a manual or auto?
  An auto.
  For business use at the moment, yeah?
  Pardon?
  It's business use you're on?
Right then, driver.
I know you're chewing an Airwave.
We both know why you went back to get an Airwave.
You've been drinking alcohol.
I can smell it on your breath.
In fact, not only can I smell it on your breath,
  I can smell it on your skin. Are you an alcoholic?
  No.
You've got a can of Tennent's Super half drunk in the cab
in your centre console.
  Have you got rid of the Airwave in your mouth?
  No.
Open the window, please, or open the door, drop the Airwave out of the car.
When did you last have a drink?
Oh...last night.
What's that can of Tennent's Super, still fizzy, doing open there?
It's from last night.
The smell that was coming off him
was just too strong for it to have been last night's drinking and from just one can.
You do get a sixth sense. And...
having got the smell coming from the back of the car, looking into his eyes,
his eyes were just yellow, yellow and bloodshot,
and then I started thinking that perhaps things were a bit more serious
than I first thought when I first got that smell.
Further south, PC Simon Breckles and Martin Smith are still trying to find the phone
they believe was being used by the driver.
It's proving elusive.
I checked every inch of that van. He said, "I haven't got it in my pockets,'"
he looked through his pockets.
I think he put it down his trousers.
If they can locate it, they may be able to prove he was on a call.
The reason I'm trying to get hold of your company is I'm trying to find out which pocket your phone is in.
It's not in the van because there's absolutely no telephones in the van.
There's just the hands free equipment.
When I ask them for your mobile phone, do you think it'll ring in one of your pockets?
I can strip right here for you, if you like.
I'm not going to ask you to do that, I've got no power to search you.
I've said I'm happy to be stripped so...
I know there's something not right because looking into that van, there's nowhere that phone could go.
For your benefit, as well, we'd like to find your phone obviously,
because you're concerned you won't be able to get work calls, will you?
Hello? Hello, I'm PC Smith from the motorway police in Birmingham.
I've got your boss in the police car with me. We have a problem.
He can't find his mobile phone.
Can you tell me his number?
Thanks for your time. Bye.
At least we'll be able to find the phone now, won't we?
Now he's the man's number, PC Smith makes the call.
And waits for it to ring.
Is it on open or is it on silent?
I don't know.
Well, it's not ringing in here.
I suspect he was under the assumption
that if he hid the mobile phone then he might get off with the fact
that we can't find the mobile phone.
So you actually get points for just having it in your hand?
The fact you was on it, sir, I saw you with your phone to your ear.
The motorway cops are still frustrated
they couldn't prove beyond any doubt he was using his phone.
He was on his mobile and was seen by a police officer to be on his mobile phone,
if he wants to argue that, we'll go to the court
and we'll argue whether he was on a telephone or not.
If he wants to go to court, we'll go to court.
  It's in his pocket.
  It's in his pocket, yeah.
He switched it on to silent and then he put it on his pocket.
Or in his trousers. The front of his trousers.
But PC Smith thinks he knows how the driver may have outwitted them.
Something that made me suspicious about where the phone had been hidden
is as he walked towards the police car,
it was quite noticeable he put his hand just inside his coat,
round about his waistband of his trousers,
making sure something was secure or tucked in.
That's what gave me the initial suspicion that the phone had been hidden inside his trousers.
Further east on the M42, PC Rounds is questioning the driver
of a 44 tonne lorry about the open can of strong lager he found in his cab.
You're telling me you haven't had a drink today.
  No.
  When was the last time you had a drink?
  Last night.
  Yes, what time?
I don't know.
  Well, late.
  Late?
  About midnight.
  And how much did you have to drink?
About three...three cans.
It's the moment of truth.
Right, what I'm going to demand from you now is a specimen of your breath for analysis.
I'm asking you this because I can smell alcohol on your breath,
about your person, coming out of your skin.
You do smell to me as if you're a regular drinker, and it's just coming out in your sweat.
All right? I acknowledge the fact that you're saying you had a drink last night, but there's an open can
of Tennent's Super half drunk near to your centre console.
Deep breaths, let me hold the machine,
seal your lips around the tube and blow until I tell you to stop. Blow.
Keep going, harder, harder, harder. Keep going.
OK. Right, we're analysing that.
I'll try and hold it so you can see it, it's a bit difficult.
You've failed that test.
You've blown what that says there.
35 is the limit. What it means is you are two and half times the limit.
  You're joking!
  I wouldn't joke about something like that, would I?
  So, you're under arrest...
  I'd never have believed it.
  ..on suspicion of driving
  with alcohol on your breath.
  I'd never have believed it.
  You're over the limit.
You're under caution, is there anything you want to say?
  I just...couldn't... just don't believe it.
I think it would be more accurate to say he didn't want to believe it.
Because he didn't exhibit a lot of the outward signs
of drink driving, or somebody under the influence of drink,
i.e. he wasn't particularly unsteady on his feet,
his speech wasn't slurred,
when we got that reading, which was approaching three times
the legal drink drive limit, that did come as quite a shock.
Bloody hell, I'd never have believed it.
You drive a 44 tonne lorry at 56 miles an hour
and don't react quick enough, and go in to the back of a car, there is going to be damage.
There is going to be injury.
There's a good chance there's going to be a fatality.
Oh, well.
It's all right tutting, mate, but at the end of the day, you're the one that's been drinking, isn't it?
Well, I didn't think it was that much, I honestly didn't.
Well, I'm not going to sit here and call you a liar
but I can quite confidently say if you had three cans of beer last night, you wouldn't be blowing 92.
It wasn't last night, though, was it?
  Yes.
  No, it wasn't.
Not to blow that reading.
You expect to find your drink drivers
late in the night, early in the mornings on the weekend.
What you don't expect to find is someone in the afternoon rush hour on Friday afternoon
drunk, and so drunk that they're registering off the scale, really,
when you take them out of the cab.
For him to be driving a 44 tonne truck in those circumstances, it's just a killing machine.
Now, the priority is to get the driver to the police station to confirm the reading.
That means PC Nairn will move the truck off the motorway.
I can smell the alcohol.
He must have been drinking all day.
You know, you can't have a good night out
and still be 92 the following day at half past four in the afternoon.
You'd have to be drinking cans of lager throughout the day.
I mean, that guy's got a serious problem.
He shouldn't be behind the wheel of anything.
You know, either a pushchair, or even a car itself.
PC Nairn makes a further check of the cab.
It seems like...
..our man...
likes to drink more than he drives.
Special Brew. Best of stuff.
That's 9% volume. I think this one's 9% as well.
Yeah, both 9%. So there's...
..10 cans. He was in for a good night.
But he'll be having a very different night tonight.
He said, "I WAS a lorry driver."
I think he knew.
He knew how much he'd had to drink.
He knew what the machine was going to come back.
He knew he was going to be over and what his fate was.
Blow.
It's been approximately two hours since he blew nearly three times the limit at the roadside.
But this is the test that counts.
Right, the readings there are 73 and 69, so we'll go on 69.
So that's still over the limit?
That is just under... just under twice the legal limit.
In that two hours, you have lost some alcohol from your body, but you're still,
two hours after we stopped you driving,
double the drink drive limit.
I really am surprised.
If we hadn't taken him off the road in the state he was in,
bearing in mind he's probably been in that state most days he's been out driving his truck,
then I think we've saved somebody's life.
Let's look at what this bloke was doing.
He was driving a big truck, 44 tonnes,
at twice the drink drive limit.
If that's not criminal, I don't know what is.
The trucker who was just under twice the legal limit
was convicted of drink driving, fined £115 and banned for 18 months.
The driver who couldn't find his phone didn't pay his ticket
but no further action was taken against him.
The man with the baseball bat in his car was cautioned for possessing an offensive weapon.
He was also fined £525
and received six points on his licence for driving without insurance.
The driver of the overturned car was convicted of driving
without due care and attention and received a £250 fine and eight points on his licence.
The trucker who exceeded his driving hours was convicted of driving on a provisional licence,
fined £315, and received six points on his licence.
And the driver of the box van was found guilty of driving without due care and attention,
fined £148, and given four points on his licence.
