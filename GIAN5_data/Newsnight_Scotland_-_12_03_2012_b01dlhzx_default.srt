appropriate to ask a head of Government if he wants to be known
as Mad Alex. And shareholders plot revenge on the Royal Bank of
Scotland old bosses and how many questions make a good referendum?
Are we any wiser after the analysing? The American developer
Donald Trump has upped the ante in his dispute with the Scottish
Minister. Trump has been campaigning against a wind farm
proposal offshore from his golf complex. The tycoon has made clear
his disapproval of Scottish wind farm developments. Now he is
getting personal. In a letter to The SNP leader has not risen to the
bait and a Government statement was But the Liberal Democrat leader was
A short while ago, I called Donald Trump at his office in New York. I
asked him to outthrien point he was making.    outline the point he was
making. Scotland is a beautiful country to have these ugly
industrial wind turbines, 7,000, maybe 8,000 and I even hear numbers
higher, to have them throughout Scotland, ruining the shores and
the beauty, would be a disaster. Now the people in Ireland are happy,
because tourism in Scotland will cease to exist. Before when I
decided not to do the job, because they were going to put turbines up,
they all said, well I guess you know the turbines won't be built
and they weren't. After my investment was made, they then said,
here come the turbines. So I thought I was dealt with very
unfairly. Is this about Scotland and its environment, or is this
about you and your particular investment? No, I'm happy with the
fact we built this and I look forward to the next phase, as soon
as I get assurances that these won't be built. I love the idea of
building a hotel, I think it will do well. We don't have a loan on
the property, it is interesting e  interesting, I built this out of
cash from my own pocket. I thought you had downed tools? No, we
haven't stopped work. We built the course and it is going to open, in
fact now we're building a temporary club house. And it is going to be
opening in the very near future. It will hope in earl    early July.
That will happen regardless of the decision on the planning
application. Yes it is finished. We have completed it ahead of schedule.
We will open, in fact we would open sooner, but we wanted some of the
great European players here. They will be in Scotland for the
Scottish Open. Wouldn't turbines and many others help save the
planet and the impact that climate change may have? No, well that
depends on whether you leave e    believe in climate change. A lot of
people don't believe in it and don't see the issue. You don't
believe the vines? I frankly, as far as climate change, I'm on the
fence. I'm not a believer. And just so you understand, there is always
climate change, but I don't believe some of the reports that came out
and if you look at some of the studies, they are proven to be
false. To destroy Scotland over something which many people don't
believe is in fact a fact is a terrible thing. To destroy the
tourism industry in Scotland, would be I think just, which is I believe
Scotland's biggest industry, would be a disgrace. What do you make of
the comments from the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie
Rennie who, says you're turning more eccentric and hysterical by
the day and you're attempting toing to bull    to bully the First
Minister. Don't know who he is. Don't care whoers. If not
hysterical, is not intemporate to describe an elected politician as
being mad? I'm not saying he is mad. But if this goes forward they will
refer to him as Mad Alex. I say that, with all due respect. If he
allows Scotland to be destroyed with his ugly machines, you're talk
about 7,000 to 8,000 all over the coast of Scotland, the only one
happy about it will be Ireland. Because they will take all of your
business as sure as you're sitting there. I thought you and the First
Minister were friends, you described him as an amazing man.
thought we were friends, when somebody who comes out with who igs
a politician with an idea that is insane. I have to speak up. I have
an investment to protect and a country I love, because my mother
was born there. I'm doing a great service to Scotland. Because
Scotland is going to be destroyed if this litter is allowed to be
built all over its coast. Donald Trump, thank you. Thank you. Now,
the stage is set for a serious legal battle between the people who
used to run the Royal Bank of Scotland and a group of
shareholders who think they were conned out of �12 billion just
before the bank collapsed. Court action is being planned on behalf
of individuals and institution which bought into the Royal Bank's
special issue of new shares, which was designed to raise new capital
to tide the bank over a difficult period. And we all know how that
ended. It is called a rights issue. A company wants to raise capital,
so it offers new shares. Often at a discounts, to existing share horls.
Like any issue, there are a lot of rules and the main thing is the
prospeck us the must be honest and fair. The problem with the RBS
issue in 2008 is that it was followed less than six month later
by the failure of the bank, which was only saved from closure by
Government intervention. Did nobody know there was trouble brewing?
They in a document suggested that 12 billion would sort out all their
problems. They were fully aware by all accounts, and I have read the
letter o' claim, took me three hours to go through it, in great
detail and it appears from that letter, that there were many
examples of evidence that they knew full well that that would be
inadequate. The RBS share holders' action group reckons it is unlikely
in the extreme that everyone in authority in the bank was of the
opinion that everything was fine. So they're threatening to go to
court to recover their share of the 12 billion. When you have a rights
issue, you have to sign an agreement that you will not go back
to your shareholders, for at least a year, and they went bust within
five months. So the shareholders have every right to feel aggrieved.
And some people lost their life savings on this and it is a serious
affair. The bank responded by saying it has substantial and
credible legal and factual defences to the claim and will defends
itself vigorously.    defend itself vigorously. One part of claim is
the acquisition of the bank ABM AMRO. The bank presented this in
glowing term, although insiders described it as a disaster. And
there was talk of borrowing that was not revealed. I'm joined by
Iain Fraser who broke the story. Why has it taken share holes so
long to bring these action?    shareholders. I think they thought
the Financial Services Authority would do a better job of
investigating the matter. As you know, the Financial Services
Authority, its main role is to police the city. But the view, well
they were depending on it to produce a thorough report
investigating the matter, whether or not shareholders were misled.
But the part of the report into the RBS that was publiced    published
in December, it was supposed to be published earlier, it didn't seem
to tackle this issue. Once the report came out, it was
disappointing. And they then decided I think to proceed with the
legal claim. Problems of this sort don't come around often, is there
any historical example of an action of this sort and if so how did it
turn out? I don't know of an exact comparison. Although you can think
back to the City of Glasgow back in 1873 where within one year the
entire board, or certainly a number of directors, were in jail. That is
a... A parallel. But it is a long time ago and a different
environment. I am not aware of an action such as the one which these
people are proposing. What happens now? Well I think the board, the
board of directors who were running the bank in 2008 have 90 days to
respond to the allegations which are in the letter o' of claimment
and the bank itself, the current bank has 90 days to respond to
these allegations. And if they don't respond to the satisfaction
of the people who are putting forward the claim, who represent
large institution s and small investors, then they will proceed
with a court case in the High Court in London. They will be seeking at
least �2.4 billion, but possibly more. Obviously, they have put
together a case and the bank says it will defend itself, we have yet
to hear from them, but what the    but what is the whistle blowing
culture like in these banks? There doesn't seem to be whistle blowing
culture. There was one guy called Paul Moore, who emerged in HBOS and
opened a lot of internal practices that were not known and the risk
management failures, but within RBS there are... There is no equivalent
to Paul Moore, who has come out and stated that risk management
processes that were inadequate or auditing was. There is evidence to
suggest that these things were inadequate within RBS. There is a
guy called Clive Adamson, a former Executive with the Financial
Services Authority, who apparently stated to an author that RBS's
disclosures in 2008 were a pack of lays. He discovered this when he
was working for the Financial Services Authority.    pack of lies.
But he was sat upon and not able to reveal or release the information,
because if the FSA had publicised the fact that RBS's mandate were a
pack of lies, it would have undermined the way it was
regulating the banks. shareholders feel they have been
coned, isn't it possible that those at a bank which made so many
disastrous decisions, seemingly blind to the consequences may have
asked for shareholders to buy more shares, without knowing the real
dangers? Sorry could you repeat the question? I wonder if it is
possible that the share rights issue could have been made without
any knowledge of the difficulties to come? I don't believe that is
possible. I believe that the board of directors were much more aware
of the trouble in which their bank found its and they were aware of
trouble in which ABM AMRO found itself and they were hiding this
information. That is what a court case like this is justified in my
vau. Thank you.    in my view. Now, three out of four Scottish
political parties have had their Spring conferences and the Prime
Minster has already told us what he thinks about the constitution. So
you'd think everyone's position is now completely clear as to what the
referendum should be about. It's not, however, as simple as that.
Shortly I'll be hearing from a leading authority, first David
Allison reports. Over the past two weekends Labour and the SNP have
been in spring conference mode. No surprises that constitutional
change has been top of the agenda. One way or another. Let me tell
Alex Salmond something. Putting Saltires around his fire place is
no proof that he is putting Scotland's interest first, and
there is one thing we are good at   spotting a con man when we see one.
Labour along with the lest    rest of the anti independence campaign
have a lot of catching up to do with the SNP, who are riding high,
both in term of party membership and their campaign war shest chest.
Home rule with independence, beats Tory rule from Westminster any time.
So the party faithful have been lapping it up, despite a host of
unanswered questions from both sides. In the real worlds, away
from the weekend conference venue, others are trying to work out what
this means in practice. We know there will be a referendum, but
what question will it ask? How many questions will there be? Its up for
grabs. Can I welcome you to this meeting? At Westminster, the
unionist party come dominated Scottish affairss committee is
holding an inquiry on what they call referendum on separation for
Scotland. Last week they heard from distinguished political scientist
and pollsters and asked if Devo Max should be a referendum question.
seems from opinion poll evidence this is the option most Scots
favour. It would be odd in an instrument designed to discover
what Scottish people think to exclude the option that they most
favour. But aren't these things undefined. What we're coming to is
an understanding as the terms of this potential independence are
being redefined, week to week and day to day by the Scottish
Government and I don't blame them that, there would be an element of
pig in the poke, even with a vote for independence. The result likely
to be the subject of negotiations, should people get a second
referendum? If there is a referendum, we know what no means.
But we are not sure what yes means. If you were to have then a post
referendum referendum you could gate question majority the first
time and a no the second. So many questions, so few answers. John
Curtis know no stranger to this programme, offer one way out.
first indeed have the straight clear question that everyone seems
to agree they want, which is do you want Scotland to become independent.
Then you can have the seconds question, or if you want you have
have a second referendum and there is a more of a an argument, that
says if Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom, do you want to
have devolution Max or the status quo? The experts agreed the second
question was possible, but the question for Labour, the
Conservative and the Liberal Democrats is what to do about it.
If anything. With just over two and a half years until the referendum,
the next major test for the parties is over places like this, Glasgow,
what you hay may say do council elections have to do with the
constitution? Not a lot, but that won't stop the parties. I'm joined
from Oxford by the University's Professor of Politics, Iain Maclean.
As you saw in the film, he was one of the academics giving evidence
about how many questions would make a good referendum. More than one is
advantageous? It has advantages? But it has down sides. The clip you
played had me talking about the advantages. But I think in
somewhere else in that hearing I talked about the down sides. Which
are? The down side, the biggest down side is supposing you got a
vote yes for independence and a vote yes for Devo Max, what happens
then. The Scottish Government would say that is a vote for independence.
The UK Government would say, hang on, a higher proportion of the
Scottish people voted for something else. And none of us at the moment
know what that something else would be, or is. Which is another reason
why although as you saw I said to the committee, that it seems on one
way of looking at it odd to exclude the option that most Scots seem to
wants. Is Devo Max, Dee Voe plus or Dee Voe more, a package short of
independence definable? One has been defined by the Calman
Commission that was commissioned by the previous Government and has
been adopted by this UK Government. That is devo more and that is
something we know. Some people say it is not enough and they want devo
more, more and maybe devee max. And so somebody has to say it means the
following taxes will be devolved and the following spending areas.
There is the devo plus package. Well yes, slightly fewer taxes.
it should be possible to define whatever package is offered? Yes,
it should. If that is possible, and it did go on the ballot paper with
independence, how do you get around the problem that you have raised
about what happens if both options get a positive majority yes vote?
That is one of the easier questions. Because there are ways of doing it
which haven't been tried in the UK but they're perfectly robust. That
is you take each of the options against each of the others, like a
round Robin tournament, everyone plays everyone else and you see
which one beats all of the others. Now of course if known beats the
other, you go around in circles and that is a problem F you don't have
that problem, you would come up with an option which would beat the
others. Are you talking about multiple choice or having a gate
way question for constitutional reform yes or no and a second
question testing independence against devolution more in the vent
that people say yes to change? would prefer it to be all on the
same ballot paper. So the options would be set out, independence and
there would have to have been some booklet that said what independence
would involve. Doe Voe    Devo Max and that must be propose and you
should say what it is involves and a note that it takes two to play
devolution and there would have to be a Westminster response and then
no to both that would involve the the present UK Government. Doesn't
this get confusing for you and I, never mind all the many thousands
and millions who are being zod vote and don't follow this   being asked
to vote and don't follow this story. Yes that is one of the argument
say to those who say more devolution in whatever form and
independence are similar pill my of a different    are simply of a
different magnitude, one is about independence and one is about
changing the relationship with the state that is is currently part of?
Yes this is moving fast. The Scottish Government has been
recently fleshing out its vision and it seems that independence is
not as complete as people may have thought. Keeping the monarchy,
keeping the currency and now going for some defence agreement with the
UK. But the full transfer of sovereignty, how much of it you
wish to pool thereafter is political independence, and is of a
different Mag dude to devolution more? The Scottish Government says
that, but I have a difficulty in seeing that. What is the complete
transfer of sovereignty if you're going keep the pound sterling? You
have not completely transferred sovereignty, because you don't
necessarily have control over that southern si. I'm not saying I'm for
it or against it.    currency. I don't see it as a complete transfer
of sov   o' sovereign si. Thank you. Now a quick look at tomorrow's
front pages. The Daily Mail, Lockerbie bomber's drug is refused
for slats. The Scotsman has the same story. The drug has been found
in clinical trials to extend the lives of prostate cancer patients.
That's all from me. If you want to see the programme again it's on the
