Make it, Mister Maker!
Make it, Mister Maker!
Make it, Mister Maker!
Make it, Mister Maker!
Hello there! Great to see you again.
What do you think of my cardboard building? It's great, isn't it?
And it's made completely of old cardboard boxes.
It can be anything I want it to be!
Hello there. I am King Maker and this is my cardboard castle.
You can make boxes into anything if you use a little imagination.
In fact, that's given me a great idea! Let's try something.
Try making a brilliant box street using boxes and empty packets.
Let's make it! We need things from the doodle drawers!
Empty boxes and packets.
Some cardboard, some paper and some sticky tape.
Some paint.
A black felt tip pen, and tissue paper and some gloopy PVA glue.
Gloopy!
Whoa!
Now look at this box street picture.
It looks great, doesn't it?
You need to arrange your empty packets and cardboard boxes
onto your cardboard.
Line them up in whatever order you like,
but it's a good idea to put a small box next to a bigger one.
You can add a pointy roof, maybe on top of one of your tall buildings.
And for that we need to cut out a circle.
A good way is to draw round a bowl.
There we are   a perfect circle.
Now we need to cut this out, but be careful   scissors are sharp.
There, a circle!
Now we need to make a snip along here, up to the middle
of our circle to help us bend it into a cone shape.
Let's stick it together with sticky tape.
Ask an adult to help you.
There, a lovely cone.
And we can use this as a nice roof on top of one of our buildings.
When you're happy with everything, stick it all down with gloopy glue.
Then cover the boxes and the background with a layer of glue
and torn up pieces of tissue paper.
When it's dry, you're ready to paint your box buildings.
Choose whatever colours you like,
but it looks good if the buildings are painted different colours.
Paint the sky too.
When it's all dry, it'll look something like this.
You can even paint a sun in the sky!
Now, let's add extra detail by painting on windows and doors.
Then add some details with a black pen.
Ha ha!
When it's finished, it looks like this!
What a great effect! You can turn your boxes into ANYTHING.
It's up to you.
How about doing a night time box street with the moon and stars?
Or how about this really big one? A street with big boxes and tubes.
What a great effect! Let's take a closer look.
Cardboard boxes are great and really useful,
and you can make your picture as big or as small as you like!
Oooh! That was fun.
Oooh!
There's snoring noise coming from the shelves   we know who that is!
It's the Shapes and do you know what? They're always asleep.
Let's wake them up!
Oh, yeah!
I am a Shape!
I am a Shape!
I am a circle.
I am a triangle.
I am a square!
I am a rectangle.
I am a Shape!
I am a triangle.
Can you guess what's hiding in the triangles?
Any ideas yet?
It's a pelican!
Well done, triangle. It's time to get back on the shelf.
Whoo!
Hoo!
Oh, dear, oh.
I knew waking the Shapes up was a good idea. They're brilliant!
  Tocky here! Minute make time!
  Oh, great. It's minute make time!
Here's what we're making today   it's an ugly rock.
It's ugly but it looks GREAT, just like me!
And to make an ugly rock, you will need a glue stick,
a black pen, a pair of scissors, some white paper,
a very small, fluffy pom pom and a button.
You also need a stone and some googly eyes from a crafts shop.
Back in a tick!
I've got them!
Here they are   there's our stone and our two googly eyes.
Is it possible to make THIS in just one minute?
No way!
I think I can do it although I will have to be very quick.
I'll remind you how to do it at the end.
Let's make it in a minute!
Get your rock and glue on googly eyes like this.
There's one eye.
Now let's give him some funny hair
with a pom pom and plenty of glue.
Then stick that on.
Then a nose with a button. A bit more glue on the pom pom.
Go on, stick on.
Let's make a drawing of a mouth, a funny one.
Half way!
There we go, like that.
I'll cut this out very carefully with some scissors.
There we go. Round there like that.
Round and round we go.
Don't forget scissors are sharp so you can take a bit longer.
Now I need some glue and glue it on
to the mouth of my ugly rock!
I did it!
  Only just!
  With time to spare, actually.
And if you've got more time, you can paint your ugly rock
a bright colour like this green one.
Or how about a yellow ugly rock with a square nose?
Or a BLUE ugly rock with a bigger pom pom for its hair?
Or try making a bigger ugly rock with more eyes and painted spots.
Ugly rocks made in a minute. They're ugly but beautiful!
Why don't you make one? Here's a reminder of how to do it.
Let's go back to the beginning and take another look.
Glue the googly eyes to a stone.
Stick on a pom pom for hair and a button for a nose!
Draw and cut out a funny mouth and stick it on to your stone!
Why not try and make it in a minute!
  Hello, Mr Mister Maker!
  Hello.
  Watch this!
  What are they up to?
I'm grey.
I am red.
I am orange.
I'm light blue!
I'm dark blue.
It's a lifeboat!
Well done, everybody. See you next time.
Now it's time to Frame It!
Frame It.
Frame It!
Now, take a look at this.
What a fantastic sawdust picture.
It's great fun and makes a picture so good you'll be able to frame it.
You need coloured paper, wrapping paper, gloopy PVA glue,
scissors, a thin black pen, a brush,
googly eyes, buttons, and sawdust which you can buy from a pet shop.
Draw the outline of a dog onto some coloured paper.
Or draw any animal you like.
Now cover it with gloopy glue and sprinkle sawdust all over it.
Shake off any extra sawdust and sweep it up.
Then carefully cut your sawdust dog out
and stick it onto some colourful wrapping paper.
Why not make a collar by sticking on a thin strip of wrapping paper?
Stick on a button to finish it off and add another button for the nose.
Then stick on two googly eyes
to finish your super sawdust dog.
What a brilliant picture! Why don't you have a go?
And then...Frame It!
Great! I like making pictures out of all sorts of things.
So...let's make a picture out of jelly sweets.
What are they going to make?
It's a cooked breakfast!
Yummy! Guess what's happening now.
Do you know what day it is today? I'll tell you. It's NOT my birthday.
And even though it's NOT my birthday, we should still celebrate.
So...
Da dah!
Whoo hoo hoo hoo! Look at this fantastic NOT my birthday cake!
I tell you what though, it gives me a great idea.
Let's make something!
Make a delicious looking cake that's totally fake.
We'll need things from the doodle drawers!
Two big pink sponges and some strips of tissue paper.
Some gloopy PVA glue.
Some paints and a big brush.
A ruler and a pen!
Now, to make a fantastic fake cake like this tasty one here,
we need to start off with a piece of pink sponge like this.
And using a pen and ruler, we're going to draw a tall triangle
that looks like a piece of cheese.
Now we're going to cut it out, but be careful   scissors are sharp.
Now this is a little bit fiddly.
You might want to ask an adult to help.
Now draw around THIS sponge triangle
onto another piece of sponge.
Now we can cut this shape out as well, very carefully.
Next we make the sticky, gooey fake cake filling.
Paint on red paint first of all
to one of the sponge triangles.
We're just going to paint it along this edge here like this.
Don't worry if the paint dribbles a bit   it all adds to the effect.
Now do the same on the opposite edge.
That's all the red done on that triangle.
On the other triangle, we use a different colour  
white paint for the creamy filling.
Again, paint along two edges of your triangle like this.
Once both sponges are painted,
brush on some gloopy glue on top of the jammy triangle,
and stick on the creamy triangle so that the white edge
meets the red edge like a sandwich,
and there we have a cake!
Now we need to make some icing. We need a piece of tissue paper.
We're going to scrunch and bunch it up, very loosely.
And then we're going to take this side and fold it into the middle.
And then take this side and fold it into the middle as well.
This is going to be the icing at the back of our cake.
Add some gloopy glue at the back.
We pick up our icing and place it on.
That's the icing at the back, but how about some icing
in the middle here?
It's a circle shape and we need another piece of tissue paper.
I'm going to scrunch it up again, this time a little bit more tightly.
I'll twirl it round in a circle shape.
Round and round it goes. It doesn't have to be neat.
There   a tissue paper circle.
Add another dollop of gloopy glue.
Once your sponge is dry, it's time to use some more paint,
but this is to create the delicious icing on the back and on the top.
You can chose whatever colour you like,
but I want to do a nice white icing, so I'll get a clean brush.
Get some gloopy paint   it looks good if your paint is nice
and thick and gloopy like this.
And when it's dry, doesn't it look fantastic!
There's one thing missing   the cherry!
To make that, we need a square of red tissue paper like this.
We'll scrunch it up into a ball.
Let's brush on some gloopy glue on top of our icing.
Then we stick it on!
Ha ha! There we go!
It's the cherry on top of the cake. Wow!
A fake cake that's easy to make. Why not try other spongy delights?
Why not try a chocolate cake with pink icing and shiny beads?
Or try making a whole cake
using two large round sponges like this.
All those fake cakes look fantastic.
  The only thing you can't do is eat them.
  Time to go!
My making time's over, but yours is just beginning. See you soon!
It's time to put all this stuff back in its box.
