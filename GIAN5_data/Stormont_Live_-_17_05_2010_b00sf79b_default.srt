left do last week, politicians were momentarily excited about the
prospect of joining a remote coalition government at Westminster.
The dreams were soon ruined, and David Cameron was installed in
Number FF10 to Nick Clegg. The business of government here at
Stormont. If the DUP and Sinn Fein can go through a term in office,
the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats should be able to give it
go. Questions to the finance and health ministers today, controversy
over gay rights, and Mark is with me today. We have some new MPs
going to Westminster and could they be relied upon? The big cloud over
the rainbow coalition was whether the ash cloud would let people go
back and forth. I think there is a new opening In the Air flights with
the possibility of getting over in time for the swearing in. One of
the reasons Sinn Fein do not take their seats, they will not make the
oath of allegiance to the mark. That is one of their points, but
ultimately they see it as a British Parliament and believe they should
be heading to Dublin. A fresh intake this time. There are new
faces, Margaret Ritchie, Naomi Long, women in the ascendancy at
Westminster from Northern Ireland. And others like Ian Paisley Jnr,
and Jim Shannon, who have not been MPs there. It will be interesting
to see how they perform. They will be performing against a different
reality. We had George Osborne confirming the date for an
emergency Budget on 22nd to.    of June. Sammy Wilson could well be
working in changed realities. George Osborne is talking about £6
billion worth of cuts across the UK. Northern Ireland will take its head
out of the emergency budget. What about David Cameron. Is David
Cameron watching on the promise    reneging on the promise not to cut
in Northern Ireland? He is planning to come over, he has already done
Scotland. We should see him before the week is out. We have to put the
caveat saying. It depends what happens in Iceland. When he was
here, there was the backdrop of smiling Ulster Unionist candidates.
He did all right, they did not. It will be a different welcome.
We have seen is already with Owen Paterson. Now they will have to say,
he can do with anybody. The Conservatives are not dropping this
project but they have to be careful not to show that they are
particularly favouring the Ulster Unionists. The Ulster Unionists
have some big decisions. What looked like the immediate no 
brainer, the phrase used by one past minister, is that he should
drop the project. The Ulster Unionists are saying that they do
not want to cheese of the current government by simply dropping them
like a hot potato. It looks like they are giving it more time as
part of the process that Sir Reg Empey announced. He also announced
that he will step down by the autumn. Nobody declaring in a
leadership contest just yet. question is will it be an elected
politician, the likes of Danny Kennedy, Tom Elliot, or Basil
McCrea, or at one of the new people who came forward unsuccessfully.
There has been a lot of speculation about Mike Nesbitt. He says on his
website that he is ready to help to do whatever is necessary to renew
the party. He is obviously not counting himself out at this stage.
It is such an elongated process. They need to know which direction
they are going in. Time is tight. We are facing into another   
another election in 20th May 11.    in 2011.
Let's go to the chamber. I should point out to the Assembly
that although the money was made available in 2009, there has been
no indication that money has been available this year. I would like
to come back to the point at the member for South Belfast made, that
this would have been a one off event, had recently said we were
going to take the money from Westminster and ring fence it.
There has not been another year of funding for that purpose. Probably
it started a programme and find out you cannot continue.    find out.
thank the Minister for the information. Could he highlight,
have any Northern Ireland department highlighted funding
pressures relating to this migration from?    migration found?
There have not been any bids made by the Department for money to the
West the pressure which migrants would bring.    to deal with. I
recognise the point that are never made. For example, where a school
get a big influx and migrants may congregate around a circle   
certain area, I know this happens in my own constituency, one of the
local primary schools find a large number of children came into a
primary school and English was their second language. That created
certain pressures. It is within the remit of the Department of
Education to make provisions for those children, and within the
common for men of funding for that to happen. Where departments
consistently identified those pressures, they have an opportunity
through the monitoring rounds artery the budgetary process to
make that known.    or through the budgetary process. The issue can
also be raised to Three the committee ought to bits in this
house, and trite and persuade departments to make bids whether
our needs.    try to persuade. The First and Deputy First Minister
have spoken to the First Lord of the Treasury by phone and expected
to visit Northern Ireland soon. I will be seeking an early meeting
with the rest of the ministerial team. There are issues I need to
raise with the incoming Treasury minister, not least the approach to
and timing of the next comprehensive spending review.
Does the Minister planned to raise the Treasury agenda to look at
simplifying financial issues, and also creating better transparency
between the estimates on the budgets? Does he not feel that
would be in the interests of Northern Ireland? First of all, the
Treasury alignment projects in England where a result of concerns
raised by members over their, about budget transparency and approving
accountability.    improving. As the member will know, how we
conduct our budgetary process and the presentation of accounts is
something for this Assembly. It is not something I would particularly
be raising with the Treasury officials or the Treasury ministers.
He does raise an important point, and I think that I would be
interested. During budget debates in this house, it was raised met me
about the complexity of the information available, its
transparency, the elongated process, whether the information was
informed and was useful. Indeed, I have had more criticism about
ministers in this Assembly not presenting information when it came
to the budget process to their committees. I would be interested
in the views of Assembly members as to what we might do to improve that
transparency, presentation and the way we do with the budgetary
process. It is not a matter for the Treasury minister. I hope that the
finance minister and Executive will continue to make the case for
Northern Ireland being exempt as far as possible from cuts. Does the
Minister accept that we need to show the Treasury that we are
prepared to put our own house in order financially on things like
water. How does he plan to make that case? The member makes an
important point. I think I am on public record as saying that we
will simply not succeed if we hold out a hand and tell the Treasury at
this particular time in our economic history that we want to
keep all of our money in Northern Ireland, or that we want more. I
think we have got to make a comprehensive case. However, and I
must say that I know the member is concerned about the way in which we
have evaded the issue of water charges, but to a certain extent in
this Assembly, we have led the way in public sector say    pay. We are
the only region in the United Kingdom where we have stopped
bonuses to civil servants, inserting a context for it tighter
pay round. We have introduced spend to save measures, encouraging
departments to look forward and to take money and set it aside, so
that they could make savings in the future. The criteria used for that
were designed to ensure that ministers and departments plan
ahead to make those savings. As far as water charges are concerned, I
am sure there will be raised by the Treasury minister. He knows my
views on it, that if we are going to get into people's pockets, then
we have got to make sure that we have taken all of the necessary
action in this house to make whatever savings available. We have
all got to address the cost of administration and some of the
decisions that that may have for us personally, if we are going to
persuade people who are serious about having efficient public
spending. In relation to the answer the Finance Minister gave, that the
house will have had to take all measures possible, when he agree
with me that the Exchequer will find it strange that he was not
present for the debate on how this Executive deals with the Dublin
government, and her we bring forward policies which would
benefit both economies? Surely the Exchequer will be asking him how he
should be working with his new as partner in terms of reducing waste?
   his nearest partner. I do not want to give a member a lesson in
how business is conducted. He will know that the way in which the
business committee addresses these issues is that if there is a debate
which requires a ministerial response, the relevant minister
will be assigned to be in this house and to answer to the debate.
I can only assume that his members on the business committee were
quite happy that this should be a to be its    a debate where the
minister did not have to be here to answer. As far as my record is
concerned, I do not run away from my issues    the issue that we were
at    live on an island where there are certain relationships across
the border, economic relationships, that we cannot ignore. Unlike his
party, which does want to ignore the most important relationship,
between this part of the United Kingdom and the rest of the United
Kingdom, which we do beat Bath majority of work rate and get the
majority of our investment, and get subsidies every year. I do not
think my record is one of ignoring the existence of the Republic, or
indeed in engaging with ministers from the Republic, whether in their
broad as environment ministers, or    whether in my role as
Environment Minister or Finance Minister. Would be finance minister
let the work    led a house know what work he has done, and submit
it in order for the Protection of the block grant for Northern
Ireland? We are working in the dark at the moment. We have not had a
comprehensive spending review. We do not know when the comprehensive
spending review will start. We do not know over what period the
comprehensive spending review will last. Also, what he read it will
look at.    what period. We need a case to the previous government
that we needed certainty. We have put a marker down that in the
middle of the financial year, it would be very difficult to sustain
very deep cuts in a budget where we have already we allocated money,
and had a huge debate on it.    re  allocated. We have signalled those
warnings to them. We have indicated what we need, we need some degree
of certainty and at least a three  year version, so that departments
can plan. In all of this, we simply can make our views as other
administrations done, make their views available to the Treasury. At
the end of the date the decision The basis of the authority for
depilatory regulation and for his role of protecting the interests of
consumers, with that in mind I believe we should have a particular
interest in ensuring that Northern Ireland had a strong, effective and
independent utility regulator. It is particularly important in the
context of maintaining consumer confidence in the developing and
more diverse arrangements for the delivery of utilities in Northern
Ireland. It is an important role in the context of the recent
fluctuations of utility costs. would like to thank the Minister
for his answer. Could he give an assessment for the need for
independence of regulation? In particular, where the utility is
owned by the public? I do not think it matters of whether the utility
is publicly owned or privately owned, were you have got a
situation where the normal market and competition within the market,
for one reason or another, does not operate, then of course you will
need regulation. Especially when it comes to the field of utilities.
But there it is gas, water, electricity, it is very important.
It is important to the individual and to individual households. It is
important because of the nature of the products. Secondly, it is
important because of the fluctuations that exist in the
prices. We have seen fluctuations in the prices in some of those
particular products and services. Thirdly, it is important because
the Independent needs to be maintained, consumers will always
be suspicious if it there is seen to be a party of which has an
interest in one side or another making these judgments. If it is a
minister who has regularly been it, consumers would think that the
minister has to bear in mind that the gas or water company is
investing in Northern Ireland, and that police department,    and
their department, consumer confidence is important. They must
not be seen to be on the side of one group or the other. I'd like to
thank the Minister for his answers, so far. Does the Minister support
the apparent need for a firm regulatory framework specified over
a number of years, including targets and measurable outcomes, so
that not all the water company but the public and ourselves can have
an agreed set of objectives and everybody can be Clear they will be
no misunderstanding?    can be sure there will be no understanding   
misunderstanding. It is very important to have a regulator with
water. Do not forget, at one point we may be looking at the cost of
water be indirectly put on to the consumer at some stage.    are
being pitted directly. The money collected must not be squandered.
There must be an investment programme which is designed to
reduce the cost of water. The issue of a clean water supply and sewage
disposal is very important to public health. It must be properly
regulated. Given the potential that a chaotic water market can have,
especially when it comes to sewage disposal, for fines from the
European Union if we miss targets, and then of course it is important
that we have proper regulation of it. Given the fact that we're going
to spend a lot on Investment for over the next 10 years, again, we
want to make sure the money is spent wisely.
Can ask the Minister, given the fact that fuel prices here are much
steeper than the art anywhere else in Europe, I would like to ask if
he is content that his department is doing enough to make sure the
pricing mechanism that companies employ affair?    that companies
employed are fair and transparent. I am not sure if he is talking
about fuel prices or oil prices. Can I just emphasise that it is not
the role of my department, or any other department, to regulate the
price of fuel in Northern Ireland. Whether it is electricity, gas or
oil, even if it were, people would not be happy about it. They could
argue that I is a minister have got a vested interest if it is a public
utility and protecting that public utility. If it was a private
utility, I may be influenced by the investment proposals. That is why
we have an independent regulator. As far as fuel oil is concerned,
that is not regulated at present. The regulator has indicated that if
this assembly decided it wanted to have it regulated, he would be
quite happy to have that included in the remit. Given the fact it is
a mature and competitive market, you are talking about regulation in
terms of energy efficiency and service standards. Protection of
the Bonn rabble.    protection of the vulnerable.
The vast majority of the Civil Service staff have moved on to a
new pay scales and have received the graded scale of pay.
The next stage will be to communicate to staff the new our
minds. Members will be contacted to have been registered in key
industrial tribunal and first back in the affected grades who have not
registered equal pay claims, the department will require them to
sign an agreement. Thank you for a good answer. Can you tell us why
the staff you left before August 2008 are excluded? The reason that
they are excluded is because of the equal pay legislation. That makes
it clear that former employees have six months to lodge an equal pay
claim with the industrial tribunal. The proposal is to settle all the
equal pay claim    claims and on that basis, those who have left six
months before were excluded. That is the legal position. We did not
be and we would not have authorisation to spend money
outside what the law requires us to do. I imagine the Public Accounts
Committee would be asking questions of we went beyond the legal remit.
Because of the legislation, that is why staff who left before that date
and had not paid claims and were not included.    had not paid
claims in. I thank the Minister for the updated response. I would like
to ask whether he is aware of the growing lobby of people would
dispute the outcome of the settlement in terms of their own
individual circumstances? I am talking about recently retired
civil servants. Would he reconsider, in those circumstances, the
appointment of an independent adjudication panel to address these
issues? The invitation from the member to reopen this question may
seem enticing, especially to all buyers who have been contacted by
various groups,    to all of us who have been contacted, the terms of
negotiation were entered into in clear terms. That is in terms of
the workforce and the department. People knew what the terms were.
Secondly, we do have tea framework within    the framework in place
which I mentioned in a previous answer. Thirdly, I do not think it
is within my power to enter into agreements for people who are not
covered by my department. It is quite clear that my department, the
people in my Department through a cupboard, they are people who
worked for the Northern Ireland Civil Service.    the people in my
department crew were covered. The question is, how far back do we go?
Do we go back 12 months, 24 months, 20 years? How far back do we go?
This assembly has had the issue of payment for some time. It may still
cost jobs in Northern Ireland. This would be a result of the pay claim.
This is simply has seen how difficult it is to address the
total cost. Well as it might be attractive, and it    an
independent adjudicator is not an option.
I welcome the support from other members for retired staff. That was
not so evident when I raised the matter at committee. Can I ask
about staff employed who are equivalent to those in the civil
servant    Civil Service? They were so Condie from the Civil Service.
Is there provision in the budgets to make a settlement, not just to
make the new pay scales, but to clearly support the position that
they ought to have the same settlement as mainstream members of
the Civil Service? I cannot answer for other ministers
department. They will have to look. I know that discussions are going
on the team minister for justice.     I know that discussions are going
on with the minister for justice at present. He will have to ascertain
his equivalents. But there is an equivalence, what the settlement
will be, if that is agreed, how will that settlement be financed?
It will be a case of putting a business case to it. Each
organisation will have to examine the terms of their particular
association of understanding. They will be to see if there is a
requirement. I suspect that the answer to the first part of the
question, since there was not a full appreciation of the nature of
the cost and the extent of the pay claim then there will not be money
in the Budget. That is where departments will have to make a
business case for it or decide how they are going to use existing
resources or reallocate existing resources to pay for any legitimate
claim. Under the current funding, we have
a four different funds. Development Programme authorities include the
special EU programmes body. We are working closely with all these to
promote a culture of continuous improvement. It is also overseen
the production of a management control system for EU funding in
Northern Ireland. Those were been subsequently assessed and improved
by the EU Commission. As far as ongoing work is concerned, at the
last meeting I had, I do not ignore what was said, the last meeting I
had, we identified £4.5 million would put savings on the programme
administration so that more money will be available for the
Nothing dramatic in those answers, but I suppose a further ahead of
tough times coming. Water charging is going to be back on the agenda.
In the question about when does he plan to meet George Osborne, there
was talk about the possibility of cuts. He said in effect, he is
still in the dark and has not been filled in by his counterpart across
the water. He did talk about, if we are talking for    looking for
special treatment in London, they are going to raise that they have
put off the raising of water charges. Sammy Wilson said, his
view is known on that. He is considered to be sympathetic and
that water charges will be inevitable. He said that if we dip
into taxpayers' pockets, we have to show what we have    that we have
done whatever we can at our end to save money. That could be code for
cutting departments, Assembly members or staff.
A leading gay activist has strongly criticised the Executive over its
failure to include gay groups in its proposed good relations policy.
The Executive is yet to publish a policy on what is known as the
cohesion, sharing and integration strategy. John O'Doherty the
director of the Rainbow Project says that whilst drafts of the
documents include a commitment to work against homophobic hate crimes,
it does not show a commitment to mix with gay groups and others in
society. We had hoped it would be more inclusive, taking account of
those victims of hate crime in our SIG    society, and help build
conclusion for those people in our society. All we see is what we
already have. Equality measures? Yes, but we have no good relations
strategy, which will work to ensure that every member of our society
can understand more what it means to be lesbian, gay or bisexual in
Northern Ireland today. We will still have the prejudice and take
that exist until we have that. do you think the good relations
strategy is missing? It is difficult for the Assembly, with
the sharing government. There are members of the government he would
not like to see sexual orientation included. Over the next number of
months, we will work with our partners in government and with
other political parties, and hopefully get a change in that
argument. Some politicians are happy enough to condemn a get    an
attack on someone because they are gay, but not willing at this stage
to promote good relations between gay groups and other groups in
society? That is what we are seeing, and we have seen this in the past,
especially after Iris Robinson. She condemned an attack on a young man
but would not move forward for the quality of a dash of opportunity
for SGB people in Northern Ireland today. Is there room for manoeuvre
   honest? We are making a party's aware of what we expect to see. We
have not seen what we want to see and will move forward to get as
much included as possible. With me now, Martina Anderson a
Sinn Fein and Alex Attwood of the SDLP. Martina Anderson, John
Doherty is making a strong point there.    John O'Doherty. It does
not mention good relations between other groups and gay groups. Why
not? That is a very valid point. I also think that we need to locate
this in law. When you look at the good relations strategy, and good
relations with them the blog, it only deals with sectarianism and
races them.    within the law. We are calling West parties in the
Assembly to have good relations strategy but we knew section 75...
That is to do with equality? Section 751 is equality duty.
Section 75.2 days this strategy. People are only dealing with two
aspects of the problems we have. That is between groups of different
religious opinion, and also in terms of races them. Alex Attwood,
do you accept that? It is encouraging that Martina recognises
what John O'Doherty said, but it is a valid point. I can confirm what
he said, the strategy does not promote good relations between the
groups that the Rainbow Project represent, and the wider society. I
think we should cut through this stuff, about what the law does and
does not say. We can still have a strategy of good relations between
the gay and lesbian community, and all other sections. We do not need
legislative back up. You can have the strategy anyway. I would hope
when Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson reflect upon this, and
given that Martina says they make a valid point, this draft strategy
will be reworked in a way that this issue can be addressed. We should
not be falling out about this. Alex would know, this draft
consultation strategy is for consultation. As someone who has
worked closely with the Rainbow Project, and I am very glad to see
the Rainbow Project up in the Assembly, it is important for all
of us that we realise that at least in the CSI strategy we have now, we
have not further advanced than what the last Executive with able to do.
We have something on the table for consultation. We in Sinn Fein, as
people who fundamentally care about the rights of every individual in
our society and one to promote a genuine equality based society, so
it is equality for all, one never signed off on a document at least
behind any section of our community. That is why we took so long in
working with the DUP to get to the point of the document, first 
section 75.1 is leased through it. What Alex is saying, because for
instance in a number of areas, it is all right for you to say let's
ignore the law. We should not ignore the law. Lead at north
Belfast. Is it the law that is being ignored? Or his it in effect,
because the DUP were comfortable with ensuring that there should be
no homophobic hate crime and that the quality measures are generally
now accepted, they do not want to go that step further and build good
relations with gay groups? Is that something you have acquiesced in?
am not here to defend the DUP's position with regards to the LGBT
community. It is truly fundamentally important that you
embrace the session 75.1.    section 75.1. You said today at the
projects that we were up this morning, at the launch, that it was
legislation that was able to bring about change. But you our
legislators, surely you should not be boxed in by legislation? I said
legislation should not be an impediment by doing the right thing
   to doing the right thing. Yes, you maximise certainty, but you
also have consistent best practice. What is needed in our society to
bring about respect, you can still go ahead and do that. I take on
board all of the warm words of encouragement... Forget me, ecology
is necessary.    4 gave me, Equality is necessary. But do you
have to avoid being an active promoter of being    of having good
relations with the gay community? As the Rainbow Project demonstrates
today, this can stand with people who have been in the past subject
to heat and discrimination. I listen carefully to what Martina
said. She said Sinn Fein were not going to leave anyone behind. In
the draft document, which John or dotty says does not have what it
needs to do, people are getting left behind.    John O'Doherty.
Let's see whether Sinn Fein measure up in terms of getting the CSI
strategy fit for purpose and fit for the Rainbow Project, and on the
other groups that at this moment feel they are from the back foot.
We are at a disadvantage because the document has not been published.
We know there were negotiations between you and the DUP to try and
advance that to the stage were Alliance would come on board. Can
you confirm to us that inure discussions, you would have gone
further, but the DUP hold you back? Most people in society would
recognise that Sinn Fein in its embrace think of all of the section
75 equality categories that there are would want to ensure that
legislation was put in place, to provide protection for the MGB to
community    LGBT community. Research has shown that there are
some were in the region of 100 Zenda 1,000 people who are members
of that community here in the north.    170,000 people. That is a large
section of society. As far as Sinn Fein would be concerned, it would
have been a different document if it was up to Sinn Fein. So you were
boxed in by the DUP? Be clear about this. We had a discussion at the
committee of the First and Deputy First Minister. Naomi Long, for
instance, would like the equality legislation and the quality
reference, of which OFMDFM has a statutory duty, she would have
liked that to be removed from the document. She was not Constable,
she thought there was too much emphasis on Equality duty and not
enough on the good relations concept that only deals with races
them and sectarianism, that does not deal with the LGBT community,
or the needs of the disabled, or older people. We in Shinfield   
Sinn Fein ensure that equality was laced through it. John O'Doherty
said it ratified what they had already? The important point is
this, let's drop the best conclusions from what Martina is
saying and let's see if Martin McGuinness delivers. If he does not,
there is no danger of a pattern. It will be that the devolution of
justice was done on DUP terms, and integration during his term on DUP
terms. Once we get there, who is running Northern Ireland? You get a
mutual be done to either side in the Good Friday    Good Friday
Agreement. The DUP is using the architecture you created? We as a
society accepts that this notion, but we believe it is fundamentally
necessary to have fundamental equality, and desirable to have
good relations. I understand why you feel exposed on this. I do not.
The answer is this: I think that if section 75.1 guarantees equality in
law, then legally, politically and operationally, you have to
guarantee it in practice when it comes to good relations. I am
surprised that Sinn Fein allowed the DUP to publish a document that
did not drive the point home. really do wish that what you said
was implemented by all of the ministers. I am really going to
look forward to seeing Alex implement the section 75 Equality
duty as he has outlined. He is right that as an equality duty,
there is a statutory basis on all of the ministers to implement
Equality bet has been institutionalised    the quality
that has been institutionalised and resisted. Go to north Belfast and
ask be Catholics there who need housing in north Belfast. It is
good that I'm getting so much support from Sinn Fein. Margaret
Ritchie proved the point that Martigny is making. She is putting
social housing as a priority. based on a shared future ended a
licence    and good relations... We can go back to the chamber now...
The budget has gone a long way to creating the efficiency to allow us
to deliver health and social care in Northern Ireland. The budget is
less than the need to run the health service. I will not have the
money for extra services and as I am certain the funding will be
there. I find it interesting that you are saying that when your party
has made problems with education. Listening to your responses has
been interesting. I suspect your motivation is political. The
Department of Health is in dire need of financial guidance. Surely
the duplication of services is a trained under resources.    is a
drain on your resources. We will come back to this in due course. It
is long on discussion and long on the need for proper discussion. I
am looking for practical steps. As far as the cross border issue is
concerned, when you accuse me of being politically motivated, you
need to look at the paediatric services that I am working on. We
are working on child protection, a suicide prevention, many important
areas to name but a few. If I was as political as you seem to suggest,
none of those projects to be going The standard procedure is the
member should have prepared things... On 10th September last
year, I announced that we would make a single bill to cover mental
capacity and mental health procedures, this was to be
introduced in 20th September 11. This was to be a wide ranging Bill.
   this 50 be introduced in September in 2011. It was to cover
welfare, health and finances. Question number four, please.
I thank the Minister for his response. I would like to ask him
if it is his view that the Bill should be based on rights? Without
getting in to the legal terminology, they run number of important
benefits    and there are a number of important benefits including
mental capacity. The purpose is to substitute the decision making
arrangements and allow them to make decisions for themselves. That
process must have strong protection in place. It will have a wide
application. It will cover decisions about a person's welfare
and financial affairs. It will involve them in the decision making
process. It will ensure that the views of others are taken into
account. It will ensure that decisions are made in the best
interest of the individual concerned. But the minister of
state of epilepsy will be specifically covered in any such
bill?    or will the Minister of State if epilepsy? This is carrying
on from previous legislation. The strategy for mental health and
learning disability includes epilepsy, autism, and strokes. It
will not be covered by this particular bill. It will come under
the different bill. I become the Minister's commitment to the bill.
I've been Northern Ireland is a world leader in this area. Would he
consider a Bill in relation to the disease    relation to the
legislation? As far as the legislation is concerned, the
equality impact will be consulted on in August of this year. We move
forward. I plan to have the policy cleared by the executive in the
autumn. We will move forward towards drafting a single bill. I
have crossed the part mantled support on this issue.    cross
departmental support. I have a positive feedback on this issue.
Questions 5 and 6. Question six, too, please. Thank you. I am
assuming you are referring to the hospital at the Armagh side.   
site. I need to be certain of the funding before the project can
progress. This is the position for all infrastructure projects at the
moment. I thank the Minister for his response. I have to say it is
not very encouraging. Would the Minister confirm that it was the
case that this local enhanced hospital, as it started out, that
this was deemed to be a priority, but this was agreed that it was a
priority, and that as soon as everyone was in agreement, and the
Minister wanted to proceed but this, that was actually the case? I am
still unclear as to why there is this delay. I would have thought
the reason was obvious. What I can do is reaffirm my continued support
to the hospital. The changes have been made on the development of
better services. Activity has increased. I can easily justified
the expenditure there. I can easily justified the investment. I have
had a review of the process and I have explained it to the house. I
was given a procurement process and a financial profile that allowed
for PFI. I have had to look at other avenues. I have reviewed the
financial profile of the department. I have also had to do a business
case. I have to be sure of financial settlement. Can I remind
the member, your party of 40 to take the 700 million of the health
bill. That is what you party voted for. You voted for cut for Health.
Can I remind you that when he budget came forward, you again
supported taking money off health. I have to say that I find it
somewhat ironic to hear the Kevin me    a tea here Jew telling me
that what was a priority for you    to listen to you telling me that
that was a priority for you. I did not notice that they knew were not
supporting indices in health spending. It is very ironic.   
increases in health spending. that we have a third Hospital
losing at services in County Tyrone, surely you must realise how the
people feel about your department? On clinical grounds, on safety and
health grounds, can ask you,    can I Askey, can you commit yourself
that on clinical grounds this hospital is needed, including the
continuation of the current cardiac services? Thank you. I can repeat
for the third time but I remain committed to this project. I can
also remind you that there is a financial bill in the pipeline. The
hospital will cost a considerable sum of money. We are looking at 190
million. Again, I think it is a pity that others at that time were
not prepared to get behind my proposal. Now we're getting further
on in delivering what is a vital investment for the people of the
surrounding area. Panted. Minister, can ask you if it is possible to
provide a timeline for completion for the new building of the Tyrone
County Hospital? At the current moment in time it is very difficult
for me to be absolutely certain of when the time I'm of the hospital
will be.    Timeline. Everything is dependent upon depending    a
shooting we have the money. That is part of it that you must understand.
We need the money to build it and the revenue for consequences. We
need the money to actually done it. I remain committed to this hospital.
   actually run it. I have invested quite a bit of time and effort and
political capital in pursuing this project. I will continue to do so.
Question a, please.    question eight. A key element of this
process is to determine the availability of the funding and
support for the project. Until the business case has been submitted, I
cannot give a commitment to this or any other project in the planning
stage. In addition, given de financial climate and the
uncertainty surrounding it, I must look at all project.    at all
projects before anything can progress. I thank him for his
answer. On the back of the recent news for the further cuts on
facilities in my constituency, would it be possible to ask if
people prioritise the level to health care centre given the gains
that would mean for the community there? All these are factors that
will be taken into account. The point of the help and care service
and Carrick Fergus is to communicate the community teams
into a one stop shop. It will integrate primary community care
needs. That is the point of it. It is one of the projects that I feel
Stockline about.    feel strongly about. I have to say, capital
funding remains the ultimate. Until I have absolute certainty I would
be misleading you apply this to say anything other than it will be
reviewed. The minister has said that a primary health care service
for Carrick Fergus would reduce some of the pressure that currently
exists at Antrim Hospital. There is a degree of urgency here. If
capital funding is not secured, are there any other arrangements which
might allow this to be brought All of these issues will be
considered as part of the drafting of the business case. We are also
tied to value for money, which is a Treasury principle which overrides.
I do not run any form of funding out. Clearly, we need not simply in
Comber, but also in Carrickfergus We will leave the chamber there. An
Ulster Unionist MLA has called for a review of integrated education
after he discovered that pre  schools in particular have failed
to meet their targets for a religious balance of pupils. 30% of
pupils that integrated schools are expected to be the minority
religion of the area in which the schools are located. Figures
released today show some fell short of that. The figures are in
relation to three schools, ones which were previously in the state
sector and said they wanted to be integrated schools. They do not
seem to be that integrated. What is happening? There are several issues
here. When we get up there was particular schools, they are three
out of 61. If you look at the challenges that face a transforming
school, and they take the decision to move towards integrated status,
first of what they are carrying the history of a particular tradition.
We will go back to the chamber, sorry to interrupt you. It is an
emergency question on hospital closures in Mid Ulster and
Whiteabbey. The Speaker has agreed that party
representatives with the constituency interest will be given
an opportunity to ask a supplementary question. I call the
Minister of Health. Patient safety is of the utmost
priority in the delivery of health and social care services. I will
not compromise in that position. In its 2002, developing better
services was established and Whiteabbey and the Mid Ulster
Hospital its work established    were established. Changes had been
scheduled to take place over the coming months. The Trust has made
me aware oppressions    pressing safety issues and difficulty
sustaining the current level of acute services which mean changes
to the current A&E services on both sides and the in patient services
at Whiteabbey Hospital. The advice of the new commissions on the
ground is clear. This change is necessary within the time frame the
Trust has set. The Northern Trust and Health and Social Care Board
assure me that those affected will be in a state of readiness to
implement the change as planned, in addition the Trust will ensure the
minor injuries services provided from next Monday are supported by
medical cover for a period of two months to provide a safe transition.
I tabled this question to refer to Whiteabbey and Mid Ulster. I'm
grateful to the Minister for his reply. He will be aware of the very
great distress and anger that has been voiced on the ground in my
constituency, and indeed further afield, at the suddenness at which
this decision was taken. It has had a major impact on patients and
staff, whom I met when I visited the hospital on Friday and spoke to
a consultant doctors, staff, auxiliary staff, who were all
extremely perturbed at what they see is a breach of the agreement,
that these services would be removed after the area hospital in
2011. It is clear when I met the trust chief Executive on Friday, he
says it is not a matter of money, and therefore it should be a
question of management. Such a situation has not been arrived at
overnight or suddenly. Therefore, what makes it an emergency night
when he was not an emergency previously? I'm asking the minister
that instead of approving this suggestion, that he take    takes
time to review it, schedule so the transition for next year, and I
also ask why cardiology services have been included? Also, the issue
that has been raised by staff and patients about the ability of
Antrim Area Hospital to cope. There are a number of points that
Mr. Has remarked on. I will try to address them as best I can. This
was consulted him and agreed upon as the way forward in 2002.   
consulted on. There has been a long period of run in. When I came into
the Department of Health my view was that we would sustain these
services for as long as possible and as long as patient safety
allowed. The overriding principle is patient safety. What has changed
is the senior clinicians are leaving the hospital and the
service. When the senior A&E consultant comes to me, as she did
on 26th April and said to me, we can no longer sustain this service
safely, but it would no longer be saved following the departure of
the staff on 24th May, I have no other option but to follow the
guidance of senior clinicians. As far as staff are concerned, there
will be a short period of consultation, and I will make steps
to ensure that unions are better informed and better included in any
subsequent decisions that have to be made at any other sites. No
staff will lose their jobs, there will be no redundancies. All
service staff will retain their informant on the current site. It
won't affect doctors and it will a fact A&E nurses.    it will affect
doctors and A&E nurses. The Antrim Hospital can cope, and the
strengthening of the service by the editions of staff from Whiteabbey
and Mid Ulster will create a better service in Antrim. Currently, over
70% of visits to the mid  Ulster and Whiteabbey A&E departments are
minor injuries. The remainder, many of those will not need admissions.
It is in terms of the numbers that I have been given the assurance
that with the changes in Antrim Hospital, the additional beds and
the changes to the MD and so on, but all of this will be
accommodated. I would have preferred the service to continue
as long as possible and make that clear to the Trust. As the minister,
when I am faced with the senior clinician and her staff saying to
me that patients could come to harm, given the vulnerability of the
service, I have no choice other than to act.
Michael McGimpsey answering an emergency question about hospital
closures. Let's return to our story about integrated education, the
fact that some schools have small percentages of a minority religion
in them. We were just getting into your explanation as to why this
happens, why some schools are struggling to achieve their targets
of balancing the religious intake? Does it mean, if they cannot do
that, that they should still have the label of integrated? The issue
is complex. The schools that are struggling our schools that have
transformed. They carried a historical and cultural tradition.
It is a journey which the schools have to Rabat    embark on. In
addition, these schools are located in areas with a significant
majority population. In those areas, there are fewer of the minority
population to contribute to the school. We would argue in those
circumstances, it is more important that there is an opportunity for
children to learn together and share together. Thirdly, the issue
of balance does not take into account what we call "Abbas". Those
Is it something to worry about? If a school has an integrated ethos,
does it really matter about the intake figures?
There is a duty under the Education Order of 1989 for the department to
promote and develop integrated education. The current education
minister is or raise    always reminding us that she is a minister
of equality. There is inequality in education at this time. There is a
duty to provide for schools in other sectors which are excluded
from that legislation. These are schools that have transformed.
Presumably they did that for a reason, they felt they wanted to be
integrated. And why not? That is the other question that arises. Why
did they, in the first place, feed it necessary to integrate? My party
takes the view that controlled schools are integrated. They do not
bother anyone coming across the door on bases    the basis of
religion or background. If you were to do an analysis of a large
percentage of these schools, and I can speak for one particular school
on which I sat on the board of governors, the sole region   
reason that controlled status was favourable was insuring the
viability of numbers in the school, not the concept of integration.
When you have a department which allows proposals to be brought to
that road. You might get a Scone that is as mixed as one of your
integrated schools.    school. There are many issues. The
financial incentive is not a huge ash    deal et al.    at all. There
is the need for a debate about integrated education. That is where
we welcome this discussion. There is a lack of understanding of what
