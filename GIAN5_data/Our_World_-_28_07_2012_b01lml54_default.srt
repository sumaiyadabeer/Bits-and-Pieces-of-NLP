the imagination of the public. It Johannesburg. This is a post
apartheid generation free but hostage to creeping corruption.
South Africa has now reached a tipping point. Corruption and
mismanagement are costing the country to �0.5 billion in lost
poor neighbourhood on the edge of Soweto township. Within one square
mile, you can see the stark effects of bad administration, dodgy
tenders and plain, old fashioned corruption. Burst sewage pipes,
Houses build on flood plains and tarmac roads that quickly
disintegrate. Not what was expected for the new South Africa. It is a
country trying to shrug of its grim past. It commands respect for its
high ideals. The maintenance of everything here is important. It is
too bad to live in this condition. This is a microcosm what is
happening across South Africa. It is not particular to this tour
should. Though it is not. My biggest worry is that nothing is
turn things around.    enter the one women corruption buster. If the
act decisively on the cases in hand, we can show others that there is a
way to do it. Her title, Public Protector, may
sound mundane. She is reading more than 14,000 investigations, shaking
up the establishment. I think she is probably the person and the
reader who has brought most hope and the country.    a leader. On
one hand, corruption is being excused at the highest levels and
on the other hand, the state says it is committed to writing it out.
   routing it out. Already one police chief is in jail for
corruption. Another has just been fired over suspect property deals.
A prominent politician is under the spotlight over government tenders.
High profile cases have grabbed the headlines. A strong constitution
and free press still gives South Africa a chance to win this fight.
It's the beating heart of a vibrant continent, the economic powerhouse
of Africa with a growing middle class which is aspirant and with
money to spend. It is also one of the most unequal societies in the
world. It is an imbalance that many South Africans feel must be
addressed. The vast majority of people we talk to admit that
corruption has got worse. Especially at the grassroots level.
So, she is on the road for much of Town hall meetings like this one in
the rural heartlands are a chance for ordinary South Africans to have
their grievances heard. Housing, water and other public services are
high on the list of complaints. As we travelled the length and breadth
of South Africa, allegations of corruption or plain mismanagement
are not hard to find. The Public Protector clearly has her work cut
out. A new word has entered the South African mine which, tender
primer. It is a person who makes their money through abusing
government contracts. Three hours' drive north west of Johannesburg,
we find a new water treatment project which is recycling sewage.
This is the type of development that is investigated. The local
councillor says it was supposed to cost 30 million rand, about �2.5
million. These council documents revealed that the true price was
double that. The money could have had a dramatic impact on services
for this poor committee. Basic services like running water could
have been provided for people. My key to build 5,000 houses with this
money. It was an overspend.    we could have built. This plant has
been operational for about six months. We can't find a single sign
warning people about any danger. That is interesting. These
documents show that 1.4 million rand was allocated for precisely
that purpose. No safety signs. The council was unable to give us an
explanation. You are used to living your life... Of the Astor to
accompany us back to the township where there are so many problems.  
  we asked her to accompany us. Soweto, the proud heart of South
Africa's fight against white minority rule is now shamed by the
council's failure to deliver basic services. As she takes more
statements from residents, I made this man at his council house.    I
meet. This place is sinking. With that, all of his furniture. This is
my bed. Do you think it is bad luck would do you think it is bad the
way things are organised? The depressing who built the house
think about it? This house was Another victim of council neglect.
Do not be fooled by this softly  spoken civil servant, she is
demanding answers. I was beaten them immediately. I will request
that we come here together.    I will speak to them. She has advised
residents to contact her office with complaints instead of protests.
Sent to investigate the problems in this township, finally after ten
years. His corruption getting worse? Is the government only
series about it when the TV cameras are on?    serious. 6am in a posh
suburb of Pretoria, police have come to the home of a government
official charged with a �1.6 million corruption scammed. We are
invited to witness the operation. Undercover agents have arrived to
seize luxury vehicles, allegedly paid to him as kickbacks. The
government says it will charge 100 of the top offenders. Is it too
little too late? We have people who are committed to up bridging
corruption.    uprooting. That is the encouragement that people have.
Isn't the truth, people are only willing to deal with corruption if
they are pushed into it? When we came to government in 1994, we
could not overnight turned 40 years of apartheid... We need the kind of
public servants who when they get into office as political heads or
officials, they should realise that their role is not to feed their
families and friends, but to serve the public good. All good talk from
the Party of Liberation. Is it filtering down to the rank and
file? The ANC and anticipated the power of great and the power of
wanting more. It has been shocked by how comrades have been seduced
by money.    greed. It knows the problem very well, but it is very
poor at fixing the problem. South Africa's racially divided
past has left the country deeply scarred. The black majority was
subjected to daily discrimination. 18 years on and the legacy is still
being felt despite the Party of Liberation commanding a huge
majority in parliament. Corruption was institutionalised. For black
people to be in the city they needed a pass. 20 years later and I
think the pattern of corruption is influenced by what happened in the
past. I think there is a new generation of people who are trying
to make money from corruption. were heavily involved in the fight
against apartheid. 20 years on, his South Africa where you expected to
beat in the fight against corruption? I am disappointed about
the extent of corruption. I thought we would do better in the fight
against corruption. Our opinions were a bit naive and starry eyed. I
am disappointed. I do think there is an unprecedented demand for
activity to deal with corruption at the moment. That gives me a lot of
hope for the future. The most pressing issue in the near future
is the upcoming leadership contest within the governing ANC party.
Jacob Zuma is hoping for a second term as president, there is a
strong chance he will win with his populist appeal. Corruption
allegations over a multi billion  pound arms deal still hang over him,
those charges were dropped 80 years back.    a few years. The integrity
of some of the most powerful individuals in the party and state
will come under the spotlight as a leadership battle looms. There is a
lot at stake. The former women's jail in the shadow of the
constitutional court seems the perfect venue to launch corruption
watch. She has allies in her mission to clean things up. The aim
to get leaders to stamp out corrupt practices and the public to blow
the whistle on alleged dodgy deals. Increasingly the ANC government is
being held to account by the very people who fought for its
democratic ideals. Corruption has become a chance that in our country.
It should be exercised now before it poisons our entire democracy.
For many of our young people, the education system has failed them.
Unless we deal with the issue of creating jobs, getting
accountability, dealing with the issue of deployment of
individuals... That serve the narrow interests of factions. That
is what we need to confront. Will it take a generation to change?
This school in the Eastern Cape, not far from where Nelson Mandela
grew up, South Africa's first black president. Brand new, this state
school cost �100,000 to build. There is something missing. No
furniture. The children do there are lessons on the floor. If we are
tables and chairs there are get shifted from class to class. The
school I have just visited waited four years to get its furniture.
Every time they ask what is going on they are told the money has run
out. Educational services have become so dysfunctional through
corruption and mismanagement that the National Dutchman has been
forced to take over. We are coming across cases like that.    national
government. One case was a large amount of money allocated to a
school that was not even built. seems extraordinary that when we
try and find out who is responsible, it is virtually impossible to see
where the buck stops. You know, in education and health, it is clear
the buck stops with the provincial government. We are also finding it
difficult to find out what precisely is going on. Back at home
she discusses the headlines with the children. Not an unreasonable
question for her daughter to ask. She may portray herself as an
ordinary woman, a mother who the public can relate to, but she
represents a desire in South Africa not to squander the Democratic
fruits of the struggle against apartheid. The thing I really like
about her, she is not a sort of superwoman, she does not claim to
be a superwoman. She is demonstrating that if you do your
job and you exercise the powers that you are given, you can have a
tremendous impact on society. She is viewed as one of the most
important all works against corruption.    bulwarks. There have
been attempts to muddy her name. Allegations and bringing her
children into the spotlight. But she has continued on in her job at.
Independent and driven she remains the darling of the South African
public. Although there has been the odd attempt to stand in her way, as
she stalks the corridors of power, ministers insist she will be
allowed to do her work, whatever the investigations reveal.
