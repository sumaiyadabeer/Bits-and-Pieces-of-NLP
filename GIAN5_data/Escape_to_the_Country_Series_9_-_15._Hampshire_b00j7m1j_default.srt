I'm in a county that's tremendously important if you're interested in producing this   water cress.
This little peppery leaf has more Vitamin C in it than oranges and more iron than spinach,
which makes this a very healthy county.
'In today's show I'll be helping a couple from the south east go in search of their dream home
'as the move from the commuter belt to the green belt.
'We'll be viewing some great properties.'
  This is...
  Didn't expect this at all, actually.
  'And the mystery house comes up trumps...'
  This is fantastic.
  Yeah, I like this. I really like it.
I'm in Hampshire, where for 34 years Roger has harvested water cress.
Obviously not solidly! They do use machines now.
Hampshire produces 1,500 tons of this super food every year,
but it's not the only super thing about this county.
Situated in the south of England, Hampshire covers an area of 1,500 square miles.
It's one of the largest shire counties in England.
Over time, the county's economy has largely been reliant on agriculture.
The chalk slopes of the South and North Downs have been populated with sheep for over 12,000 years.
To the west of the county is the New Forest
where the ancient system of woodland management continues today
and ponies are left to roam freely, naturally maintaining the habitat.
Hampshire also has a fine selection of thatched cottages.
As this county is famous for its cereal production, thatching straw has always been readily available.
Along with historic market towns such as Winchester, Hampshire has it all,
making it the perfect place to stage an escape to.
As you'd expect in a county with such rural beauty, with only a 1,5 hour commute to London,
property prices are not cheap. They clock in at about 35% above the national average,
which is, for a detached house, £357,000.
But our buyers today are moving from equally expensive Surrey
so hopefully the house prices won't be too much of a shock for them.
Today's property hunters are Ralph and Deborah from Walton on Thames.
They currently live in a five bedroom 1930s detached house.
After 15 years of running their own decorating business,
and with two children about to leave the nest, they want a gear change.
The reason for moving to the country is basically a slower pace of life.
We're getting very close to retirement with a view to spending a lot more quality time together.
  Yeah. And we're looking forward to a more rural location.
  Yeah.
  And just more "us" time, really.
  Us time. That's a good word.
So what is it about Hampshire that attracts them?
It's one of our favourite areas.
There are several reasons for the move. Ralph fly fishes.
  It's within striking distance of a lot of local fisheries.
  A lot of fisheries down there.
Deborah and Ralph also have a property in Montana and hope to spend more time there.
It makes sense to be within striking distance of Gatwick and Heathrow.
  We plan to do a lot more travelling back and forth.
  Yeah, we'd like a fair bit of time out there.
With the location sorted out, what are they looking for property wise?
We'd be looking at quite contemporary,
we do want to downsize, but we're still looking for an open plan ground floor layout.
  Kitchen/diner would be really useful for us.
  Yeah.
  We do need a study.
  Garden space is quite important.
  It doesn't have to be as big as this one.
Perhaps start a vegetable patch and just enjoy our time outside.
That all sounds perfectly reasonable, but there is one slightly unusual request.
Our son is 6'5" and barely makes it through these doors. Ceiling height is very important to us.
So to get the ball rolling we've invited round an estate agent for an evaluation on their house.
This is a beautifully presented, five bedroom detached house over three floors.
Within easy walking distance of the train station.
I would therefore value the property at £650,000.
So how much do they have to spend on their new property?
We're looking to set our kids up, give them a helping hand on the property ladder,
so our maximum budget would be £450,000.
Ralph and Deborah are downsizing, so they want something smaller, three bedrooms, big kitchen/diner.
They don't want too big a garden. They'll often be in Montana.
But I know for a fact that Ralph wants to be close to some good fishing.
Location wise, Ralph and Deborah have specified the countryside of north east Hampshire,
so we're focusing our search around Winchester and Basingstoke.
In today's show, I'll take them to see three fantastic properties with plenty to chew over,
but, as ever, I won't be revealing the prices until after each viewing.
And the last of the three houses will be the mystery house, offering something entirely different.
  Welcome to Hampshire, guys.
  Thank you.
  I grew up here   not that that swayed anyone.
It's a lovely county. It's not the cheapest area, but what's your budget?
We've got a maximum of 450.
  So between 400 and 450.
  Right. Preferably under four.
  Yes.
We've got a nice handful of houses, including a mystery house. Shall we get going and see them?
In you get.
Thank you.
  The countryside here can't be that different from Surrey.
  I think it is quite different.
  It's a lot more open, obviously less crowded. Don't you think so?
  I do, yeah.
  It's great fishing here, isn't it?
  It is some of the best.
You've got the three main chalk streams   the Itchen, the Test and the Avon.
  And do you fish, Deborah?
  I don't, but I enjoy reading.
  So best of both worlds.
  While he's out fishing, you can read.
  Exactly.
  Perfect.
Our first property is in Sutton Scotney, a small village seven miles north of Winchester.
At the heart of the village is a traditional country pub which dates back to 1762.
There's also a village hall that holds many events and a small shop,
making it a sociable village with a strong community spirit.
  This is the property.
  Lovely.
This is an old agricultural workers' village.
These were estate workers' cottages. End of terrace. It was owned by Lord Rank of Pinewood Studios fame.
It's got a good Hollywood heritage!
The owner's been here three years and has done everything inside.
  Shall we go in?
  Yes.
Come on in. An ocean of cream carpet is nice.
I like that. This is the front room.
It's very contemporary. They really did it up to a very high standard.
They've also reclaimed bricks here from the garden. Working fireplace.
  Is it to your taste?
  It is.
  I like the way it works into the kitchen. If you're entertaining,
  you can talk while you're cooking.
  And it's light and bright.
  Nice entrance to the garden.
Let's look at the kitchen. That's important to you.
What do you think?
It's lovely. It is smaller. We were looking to have a table in the kitchen.
If there is another reception, that would work as a dining room.
Lovely doors out to the garden. We'll look at that later. You've also got a sizeable utility room.
And a loo. All very nicely done.
Oh, there's a cat exit! An emergency bolt hole for the cat.
  Yes, it's lovely.
  I think this could work. I really do.
  This is fine.
  It looks even better than we've got already.
  Yep.
You're so easy to please! This will be a walk in the park!
  Let's look at the other reception room, which they use as a formal dining room.
  A perfect sitting room.
Just reverse the rooms. It'll be ideal.
A formal dining room in a smaller house seems a waste of space.
  Yeah.
  To be honest, you only use it at Christmas!
  Right.
  I like it.
  This is all the downstairs space. Is this going to be enough for you?
  Yes.
I think so. We're hoping to spend a lot of our time outside.
  In the garden or just out and about.
  Yeah.
It's nice if you're locking up and going to America that you have neighbours to watch over it.
  That's a good thought.
  You don't want to be too remote in that instance.
  Not really.
  So far, this fits the bill.
Good. Let's take a look upstairs.
'Either Ralph and Deborah are just being polite or they really like it. I haven't got the measure of them.
'Upstairs, there are three bedrooms. The first two are compact with original pine floors.
  'There's also a tidy family bathroom, which leads us into the master bedroom.'
  It's lovely.
  It's good.
  A really good size.
  It is.
And finished throughout with this lovely oak. They've used oak throughout, with pine floorboards.
  These doors are bespoke, made in Wales.
  They are nice quality.
  A key latch.
  Old English latch.
Lots of storage, cupboards. And...ta da! An ensuite with a shower.
Perfect. This is lovely.
  Are you shower types or bath?
  Shower. So this works really well.
  Most luxurious of all, underfloor heating in here and the bathroom.
  That's good.
  Yeah.
  This is ideal.
  I think so.
  Are you looking for a huge garden?
  Not really.
  No.
  Oops. Let's have a look.
'Inside, this house delivers almost everything they've asked for.
'What's a bit of extra garden between friends?'
It's surprisingly big. It's in two parts. This used to be out houses.
The gamekeeper used to live here so all the dogs used to live in out houses here.
The present owners knocked these down and turned it all into this patioed area.
There's still remnants   the old mill stone from the local mill and this was the fireplace.
  It works. You could have a little fire there.
  That would be quite good.
This is very well maintained with sleeper beds. Let's walk up the garden a bit.
There's a big area of lawn here at the back.
You could almost sell it for redevelopment!
We were looking at having a vegetable plot and it's ideal.
  A big vegetable plot!
  I know!
  Almost a farm!
  You could put a hedge here.
  It's great.
  What do you think about the size?
  It's a lovely garden.
  Perfect.
We didn't want a huge garden and this is pretty...enormous.
It's pretty low maintenance. Mow the lawn, then there's nothing.
  No.
  But it really is nice. A lovely house.
  It's a lovely aspect from the back.
  It is.
In terms of budget, ie what it's going to cost you, have you any idea what it might cost?
Bearing in mind that Sutton Scotney is very well placed for commuting.
I would have said in the region of...445.
In the present climate, it's very difficult to put a figure on anything.
I'd say around 425. Something like that.
You'll be pleased to know it's on the market for 389.
  That's reasonable for a very well presented good quality property.
  It is.
I think that's quite a good price. It's only been on a few months.
I'd like you to take a stroll through it and discuss whether it really is what you're looking for
  or if you're just being polite. I'll meet you out the front.
Off you go.
Wow. First property   quids in! They seem to really like it.
It is actually, standing here in the garden, a really beautifully presented property
and it would save them so much money, which is always nice when you're downsizing.
It's early days in our search, but could this be the one?
I like it. The whole house would work well for us.
And also the ceiling heights for when Toby came to stay.
I was really pleasantly surprised.
It's got a really good feel about it and I can see we'd be very happy living here.
The quality of what they've done is really good. Impressive.
This house would really fit the bill. It looks quite secure and we'd have no problems leaving it
for weeks at a time.
  I love the patio. It's beautiful.
  It really is.
  And that wall...
  There's herbs over there.
It's quite a lot larger than we were looking for, the garden, but we could make it work for us.
  Guys, I have to pull you away. Hampshire awaits.
  Great.
When Ralph and Deborah have been to Hampshire in the past, they usually fish on one of the great rivers,
but Deborah has managed to drag Ralph away to take in the sights of the cathedral city Winchester.
There's been a settlement here since 150BC
and during Saxon times Winchester was crowned the capital of England by King Alfred.
  I think the whole area is lovely.
  It is. Quite pretty, yeah.
Nowadays Winchester is an unspoilt tourist stop. Streets are lined with medieval timber framed buildings
housing a good selection of shops and restaurants.
At the heart of the city is Winchester Cathedral.
  Dating back to 1079, it's one of the largest cathedrals in England.
  It's just beautiful, isn't it?
  Quite stunning.
  So much history.
  Just look at all the detail up there. It's amazing.
  The timberwork and carvings.
The cathedral also houses the tomb of Jane Austen, who moved here for her last few years.
Another must see in Winchester is the city mill, a restored ancient water mill
on the banks of the River Itchen.
It's now run by the National Trust and is a working museum
  to watch flour being milled and you can even take some home.
  That was fascinating.
  It was.
  It's a beautiful spot.
  It is. Just sit and relax with the sound of water.
  And forget your worries.
  This is what moving to the country's about.
As the sun sets on the Hampshire countryside, day one of our property search draws to a close.
'Deborah and Ralph are looking to downsize and de stress.
'They have their heart set on finding a peaceful rural retreat for their budget of £450,000.
'So far they've loved what they've seen, but coming up is an unexpected twist.'
We wouldn't have given it a second glance.
'And they learn that things aren't always what they seem.'
I can see us living here quite happily, which is quite a surprise.
So many couple want to downsize, but actually want nothing of the sort.
They want the same number of bedrooms and space for less money.
However, Ralph and Deborah really have made the leap. They're quite prepared to make compromises
and are very open minded, so today we'll push the boat out and try some different things.
Our next property is in Old Basing, three miles east of Basingstoke.
Thatched and timber properties line the streets.
During the English Civil War, Cromwell besieged Basing House
and legend has it he kept his horses in the village church at St Mary's, which is still in use today.
There's a local pub, too, but the village is surrounded by countryside,
making it the perfect place for some peace and quiet.
This is the house I want to show you. An old weaver's cottage, 300 years old. It's listed.
  What do you think?
  Very pretty.
  It is pretty.
  Nice.
  Let's take a look inside.
  'This could be a gamble.
'They did specify they were after a contemporary feel and this property is anything but that.'
  Come on in and mind your head.
  This is an old property and includes old beams.
This is the front room, the original part.
There has been an extension.
It is a very old property with a lot of original features, including this lovely hearth.
That would be beautiful on a winter's day.
  What do you think of a period property like this?
  We've never lived in anything as old as this,
  but it's got a nice feel about it.
  It has, definitely.
  Very attractive.
  It is beautiful.
  Lovely room.
  Lovely.
  And the low beams?
I don't mind the beams, but our son would!
  He's 6'5". So he'd have a permanent hunch.
  He'd come in on his knees.
  That is the problem with older cottages. But in terms of size?
  It's good.
Nice. It's a good size.
We've got one more reception room through here. Mind your head. This is the snug.
And it is, indeed, snug.
  Very snug.
  It is, but it's perfect. You wouldn't need any bigger.
  Not at all.
It's ideal for TV and reading.
  It's lovely.
  And the fire works. You can curl up with a good book.
  I like it.
  It's a bit taller, this one.
  Yeah.
  You can stand in here. You could banish me to this room.
Right, let's look at the all important kitchen/dining room.
  This is pleasant.
  Yes, lovely.
  Really nice.
This is part of the extension. Most of it is upstairs.
You've got a lot more space here. They've opened up this space
and turned a separate room here into a sort of flow through dining/kitchen space.
  And they've joined it all up with these quarry tiles.
  Works well.
  I think so.
  So come through into the kitchen.
  It's a little small. I thought it might be too small for you.
  I don't think so.
  A nice double gas range. A real treat for cooking.
  Perfect size.
It's not what I had in mind, but it works really well.
  Good. Let's look upstairs. That's also important.
'We could be onto a winner here, regardless of the beams. Let's see what they make of the upstairs.'
You don't have to stoop upstairs. They've taken the ceiling space out.
Lovely family bathroom here. This is in the modern part.
  You've got this lovely skylight. Very high ceilings.
  Yeah.
A nice surprise, isn't it? Spacious   I like it.
  This is the new part, the extension.
  Oh, this is sweet.
  The little boy's room.
  They've done it well.
  It's really pretty upstairs.
  I really like it.
  Quite taken aback by it.
  Yeah, it's quite an eye opener.
  We wouldn't have given it a second glance.
  This is too old?
  Yeah, possibly.
  Possibly.
It wouldn't be what we would have thought of in the first place.
  But I'm really glad that we've seen it because it is beautiful.
  'I love that about property hunting.
'It can often take you unawares and throw up surprising favourites.
'The middle bedroom also benefits from those high ceilings and I'm saving the best room for last.'
  Come on in to the master.
  Well, this is gorgeous.
  Fantastic. This is...
  Didn't expect this at all.
  Beautiful.
  It's a great space, isn't it?
  Yeah.
It is a surprise. The rest of the rooms are quite high ceilinged,
  but this is really...bam!
  It's quite stunning.
  Fantastic. And so light.
  The fireplace is a real feature.
  Yeah, it's lovely.
Lots of storage, which is again quite unusual in these properties to have so much cupboard space.
And, an extra treat...
  You've got an ensuite with a shower.
  Oh.
That's perfect.
  Really pleased with this one. It's beautiful.
  It's nice.
  This is the icing on the cake, this room.
  It's a treat.
  Fantastic.
  It really is.
You definitely saved the best till last. It's beautiful.
  And you wouldn't have looked at it from the details?
  No.
  No.
We would have discounted this one straight away, which just goes to show that you shouldn't.
  Shouldn't close your mind to anything.
  No.
  It's a big change of gear.
  Yeah.
  Oh, yeah.
  It is.
But I can see us living in here quite happily, which is a surprise.
  That's what we like to hear. Let's look at the garden.
  It's a very compact garden, but that's good for you.
  It is.
  It would suit us.
  Lovely size.
  Nice size.
A little bit of gravel here, a lawn and a veggie patch.
I want to show you this bit at the side first.
An unusual feature of this house is a spring that rises below the dining room.
  How unusual.
  It comes out and flows down into the river.
  That is lovely, isn't it?
  Unusual.
  Totally unexpected.
  It used to be a basket weaver who lived here.
There was a trap door and he would keep all his willow canes in the water to keep them soft.
  That's lovely.
  Let's take a look at the bottom of the garden.
  A great old apple tree here.
  A fine old tree.
  It's a lovely little garden.
  It is.
Your veggie beds here, laid out with sleepers.
  It works really well.
  It does.
How much do you think it is worth?
I'd say...
I'm going to go a bit higher just because...and go for 415.
Well, you're in for a surprise. This property, with its location and everything else going for it
  is on the market for 475.
  Wow.
  We're that much closer to London.
  Yeah.
  It's a very desirable village.
  And those things add up.
  It's such a stunning place.
  I'm glad we saw it.
Have a look around and chew over the money side.
  And I'll see you out front.
  Thank you.
It's £25,000 over budget, but that doesn't seem to have put them off.
They seem to have fallen for it, not surprisingly.
I was absolutely bowled over by the master bedroom.
It was a beautiful room, well done.
  This fireplace is so pretty.
  Very, very pretty.
  Perfect feature of the room.
  For a master bedroom, it's perfect.
  Ideal.
The only concern I would have is the front room's low ceiling. It could be a challenge for Ralph.
But the house itself is beautiful. It has a really good feel.
  Outside space   excellent.
  I could imagine Deborah out there, pottering about.
And me just watching!
It was a lovely, lovely house.
  Hey, hello. Let's press on.
  Thank you.
'With Ralph and Deborah's move, they also want a change of lifestyle, with more time playing.
'And the ancient sport of archery is something they've always fancied.
'We've come to meet Peter Turner, President of the Black Arrows,
'to discover if we've got what it takes to be modern day Robin Hoods.'
We're doing field archery today. What is the difference?
target archery is what you see in the playing fields. You go up and down collecting your arrows.
Field archery comes from hunting training, which is why we go around and amongst undergrowth
  and up and down the slopes. OK, let's set you up.
  'It's important to wear an arm guard.
'And then there are a few things every beginner needs to master  
'a relaxed stance and firm wrist. Don't grip the bow too tightly,
'and then aim your arrow at the target and hope for the best.'
Good. You now know roughly what's going to happen.
What a shot!
  Very good.
  'Field archery is like golf.
'It's a great excuse to soak in the open countryside. And we're on Watership Down.
'The British author Richard Adams was trying to protect this landscape
'when he wrote his famous fantasy about a group of heroic rabbits.'
Remember where you were aiming.
  What a shot!
  Take your standing place there.
Oh!
Yes! That's good.
Let go when you're ready.
Yes!
'Deborah's pretty good at this. She's putting us boys to shame.'
Now Alistair. Take it down. About there. Yeah. And let go.
  Very good one! That's the shot!
  'At least I hit the target!
'Maybe I'll wait a little longer before buying green tights!'
  That was really great. Got the bug?
  Hope you enjoyed yourselves.
It's a small trial of the day. Hopefully we'll see you again.
Once we've moved up here, you won't keep us away!
Ralph and Deborah really seemed to like the old property,
but it puts a question mark over the mystery house, which is anything but old.
  What do you think the mystery house might be?
  It could be a modern property.
Perhaps a barn conversion.
A nice surprise, I'm sure.
The mystery house is on the outskirts of the village of Bramley, seven miles from Basingstoke.
This is in a rural setting and surrounded by arable farmland.
There's a pub and village store for milk and papers.
'The property we're going to see is two miles from the village centre and quite different from the others.
'I can't wait to see what Ralph and Deborah make of it.'
  This is the property.
  Mm, lovely.
  Already I like it.
  You do? There are five properties here.
Lots of neighbours. It's oak clad.
It was only built four years ago. It's quite green, but not a massive property.
  Mm hm.
  Just warning you.
Here we have the kitchen.
It's a big change of gear from the 300 year old cottage.
Granite throughout and these Italian style designed units.
Halogen hob, double oven.
  And these incredibly polished tiles on the floor.
  This is fantastic.
I like this. I really like it.
  This is my ideal, actually. Everything I would want.
  Crikey.
  Slightly minimalistic. Really like it.
  Really?
  This is exactly what I had in mind.
  Really?
  Gosh. You've been very polite, but this is what you wanted.
  Truly, yeah.
  I really like this. Modern living in the country.
  It's certainly that.
  I can't wait to see the rest.
  There's not an awful lot more!
It's all very ship shape. They've used every inch.
  Here you can see all the white goods.
  Perfect.
Great.
That takes us into the main room.
Hmm.
  Yeah.
  It's a good size.
  Lovely.
You've got the nice softwood frames. Doors that go out into the back garden.
Laminate floor throughout, which is very practical.
I was thinking very much in terms of your lock up and leave lifestyle.
Yeah, we could probably cope with this.
  it's definitely snug.
  It doesn't seem small.
It's so modern and your son can stand up here.
  Take a look upstairs?
  Yes.
'I thought after the last house they would be convinced about period property,
'but it appears they love ultra modern, too. Broad tastes!'
  This is one of the bedrooms being used as a study.
  Perfect.
That's what we'd use it for, isn't it?
  Great.
  Use it as a study.
  High ceilings.
  Lots and lots of storage.
  Hmm.
You could re insert a bed here if you wanted to. A single.
This works really well.
  You can feel how well insulated this house is. It's really warm.
  It is warm.
And all the sun comes in. There's another small bedroom here.
Have a look in here. This is the second bedroom. Not so much to see.
  Hm, this is perfect, though. We could get a bed in here, couldn't we?
  Yeah.
There's a family bathroom as well.
  The bathroom there.
  Yeah.
  Very standard.
Fine, yeah.
Works well.
And through into here.
  This will be your room, I guess.
  It is lovely.
  It's really bright. I like it.
  A nice little Juliet balcony
to greet the morning every day in your nightie.
Or in your pyjamas.
And...
  the great point is this lovely big ensuite.
  Mm. Yep.
  That's a good ensuite.
  Great. Just what we need.
  Nicely finished.
  Perfect.
  Very light and bright.
I have been counting up. You haven't said "not nice".
  It's really perfect, I think, for us.
  I think it is.
  So you like the inside?
  Yeah.
  I think the inside is plenty big enough for what we're looking for.
You're out in the middle of nowhere, but you're not remote.
  Yeah, that's even better.
  People look out for you as we would other people.
  No, it's great.
  Let's have a quick peek in the garden.
'This house has been a success from top to bottom. Can the garden crown it off?'
Welcome to the garden.
As I say, it's pretty small.
  Yeah.
  It's perfect for what we're looking for.
  Nice size.
  It's a very friendly compound. You have to get on with all your neighbours
  very well!
  Yes.
  We're quiet.
  I like it.
  The actual farm buildings have also been developed.
And they do art classes in there. It's a little community centre.
  That's great.
  So this is your little bit of the complex.
  How much do you think it costs?
  I'd say about 410.
I'd say about 380.
Well, somewhere in between. It's actually on at 399.
  Not bad.
  It's been on for a while, so...all things considered...
  Not bad at all.
  I really like it.
  I do.
  Great. Why don't you go in?
Don't stay too long   it's not massive   but wow! We've been wasting our time.
This is what they wanted! Hooray!
This barn style property built four years ago is on the market for £399,000.
I get the distinct impression Ralph and Deborah see themselves living here.
Walked up to the house and I really liked the outside. I loved the grey oak.
Very fresh and clean looking.
On entering the house, the first thing was the kitchen   stunning.
  That's a good view to...
  Wake up to.
  Look straight out.
I didn't know what to expect. It did take me by surprise.
I was very taken with it. Very taken. Very nice.
As the mystery property, this one was perfect. We've seen older style properties.
I was hoping for a new build, barn conversion or something along those lines.
So perfect mystery for me.
So that's the mystery house. Time to put your thinking caps on.
  You've given us something to think about.
  It's going to be interesting.
  It's an interesting discussion.
  That's what we want. Come on.
  Thank you.
  Thank you.
It's been a successful property search with strong contenders.
I've left Ralph and Deborah alone to see if they can reach a decision.
It's quite difficult to know which property they'll go for.
They've been all shades of enthusiastic. Possibly Deborah was most struck with the mystery house,
but Ralph might be able to sway her around to the first cottage in Sutton Scotney. Let's find out.
  You've had a busy few days.
  Indeed.
Let's go through the houses one by one.
First was the lovely workers' cottage in Sutton Scotney. How do you feel about that now?
It was good, bigger than I thought it would be. Really light and bright, lovely garden.
It was a nice house, finished to a very good standard.
The kitchen area was rather nice.
The next property I showed you was in Old Basing. A lovely, very old property.
This again seemed a bit of a wild card. You didn't want old property.
  But you reacted quite favourably.
  Yeah, that was a real surprise.
It was lovely. We really enjoyed looking around it. The garden was perfect.
And the master bedroom was spectacular.
The only downside at all would be the low beams.
Nothing else. The sitting area was very, very good.
I could just see myself sitting there on a cold winter's night, dreaming and drifting off to sleep.
  It was a superb room.
  The mystery house had no fire,
  but you still seemed to like it a lot.
  Mm, it was lovely.
  It was really clean and bright.
  As we walked up to the house, the outside was rather stunning.
Perhaps not quite as big as we would have wished for
  but pretty near to it.
  Over the whole spectrum of properties,
we've seen a lot of different periods. 300 years old to four.
You've lived in lots of different aged houses through your life.
Have you thought about where you'd like to go to next?
If it was totally down to me, I'd go with Sutton Scotney.
  The very first property.
  Yeah.
  But it's not totally down to you.
It's not.
  We have to live together and I agree with Deborah.
  Really?
  Yes, I do.
  Was there a close contender?
  Yes, definitely. The conversion.
  The mystery house.
  The mystery house.
  And for you, too.
  Yep, that was our second choice.
What swayed you towards Sutton Scotney?
Location was perfect, wasn't it?
And if we have visitors, we would like our friends to come to see us.
There was just that little bit more there to be able to put them up, show them things.
  What happens next?
  I think we're planning to make a return visit to Sutton Scotney.
  Yes.
Hopefully, once we've sold our house, we can move further on this one.
You really do seem ready to make that leap and to start a new chapter.
  I really hope it goes well.
  Thanks very much for your help.
  Thanks for showing us round.
  It's been great.
  Enjoy Hampshire.
  Thank you.
  My home county.
I was very impressed with how decisive they were. They decided, despite liking the mystery house,
to go for Sutton Scotney. All it needs now is for someone else to buy their house,
make sure you tune in next time.
