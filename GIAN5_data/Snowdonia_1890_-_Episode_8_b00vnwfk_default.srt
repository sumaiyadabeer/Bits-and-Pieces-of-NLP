In spring 2010, two families volunteered to go back in time.
Bye!
The Joneses from Denbigh, North Wales,
and the Braddocks from Abergavenny, South Wales.
Their destination   19th Century Snowdonia
and a unique way of life.
Get them all together!
It's getting a bit stressful now.
If they come round asking for the rent, we're finished.
How do you move a cow?
For one month, they would face a battle for survival that combined farm and quarry.
I told you yesterday! That's a penny now, I've fined you.
A Welsh way of life long since abandoned.
You will learn the ways of temperance!
I'm frightened to eat. It's the kids, we haven't got anything left.
You give me respect, you get it back.
It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
Coming up, there's trouble on the smallholding.
Billy, Billy, Billy.
Feel that tummy. See all the meat there?
I can't give Billy away.
There's a strike brewing at the quarry.
You will not talk of unions here, I'm telling you now!
And Mark reaches the end of his tether.
I've moaned more than anybody, been grumpy more than anybody. I think that's been my role.
It's like trying to milk a rodeo cow.
Daybreak in Snowdonia.
The families are in their final week of smallholding life.
While the Braddocks go about their usual chores...
Jamie, in. Put her in so I can get out backwards.
..David and Ben Jones are planning a surprise for Catrin.
It's her 40th birthday.
This is all we've got,
but back in 1890, there wasn't much spare cash
so I'm sure she'll understand.
We're just rushing so that she doesn't come out and see it.
I know she's up, but she's not looking out of the window. She's making breakfast.
Jac!
Jac Llywelyn, are you up?
Jac! You'll be late for school.
Some things don't change. No sign of Jac   it's 7.15am.
He's still lying in bed.
Mark Braddock is reaching the end of his tether.
Smallholding life is not for him.
This life, in 1890, is an extremely stressful life.
Those poor men, they get to work at 9am in the morning,
they've done three or four hours' work, seeing to the animals, everything that needs to be done,
then a full day's work, and then they do it again   that's their existence.
No, don't you dare.
I think my role is chief moaner, chief grumpy, grumpy guts,
and cow milker.
I think that has been my role in this whole experience.
Alisa has turned out to be the pillar,
which, back home, she's not.
She has kept everybody going, everything together,
she has kept this place together, made sure there's food on the table,
she's been fantastic.
That's a real nice surprise because I think she's proved something to herself as well,
which has been nice.
  I've got say sorry for being horrible.
  You've got to say sorry?
  I want to.
  Are you happy now?
  No, I'm not happy.
  You're not?
Oh, who's done that?
Oh, my goodness! Thank you.
It is a big day and it's a lovely day, so that's great.
I'm feeling fighting fit
and the joints aren't hurting today or anything, so life begins at 40!
Let's get the porridge on.
7.30am, and time for the men to leave for the quarry.
They now have only two full working days left
to meet their production target of 3,000 slates.
  How many do you reckon we've got?
  I reckon we've got about 2,000.
We need to be making over 100 an hour.
  0.5 seconds to make a slate.
  Splitting and dressing?
  Yeah.
It's an impossible task and spirits are low.
We're stuffed. It ain't going to happen, is it?
At the quarry, the steward's welcome is less than warm.
Ten minutes late today. A tuppence fine for you each, OK?
Come on, then, lads. Let's get on these slates.
For the men, it's the last straw.
We've been fined again. We haven't been paid since we've been here.
We're getting palmed off with poor slate.
We've just had enough, all of us.
Ben Jones downs tools.
What the hell's going on here? Get out!
That's another tuppence fine, Ben, for lying down on the job.
Get up. Get back to work this instant!
That's fourpence today already.
At school, the children have a visitor.
  Morning, Sir.
  Morning, Mr Williams.
The Government Inspector has arrived
to asses how well the pupils are performing.
You will be tested today on your reading skills
and your skills in writing
and also in mathematics.
"This is Edward the First of lengthy limb...
"Wales was annexed to the realm by him...
A lot rides on this exam.
"With the Scots...
If the children perform badly, the school might have its grant cut.
"Son of Henry the Third from whose life we find..."
And Tommy, as a pupil teacher, may not receive a penny of his weekly wage.
The examination is now over.
Let us hope that the results are successful
and that this will be for the benefit of the school
in the future.
I got a bit confused on the writing
so I just wrote everything that came into my head, really.
The butcher arrives at the smallholding with some much needed supplies.
  Good morning.
  Good morning.
  How are you?
  Fine, thank you. Come in.
Big basket again.
I hear you've got geese for sale. Have you got a price in mind?
I don't know what you can do for us. We could do with a joint of meat each.
I've got some joints here, which are lovely.
I was thinking to get ten shillings for these,
five shillings each, and I'd give you 13 shillings for the geese.
Oh, that would be fantastic. Let's go and get the geese!
  So we'll clinch a deal?
  That is amazing. Thank you.
  You've come to our rescue again.
  I think I'll even give you a kiss.
I have to now, don't I?
The joints of meat and extra cash mean that Catrin and Alisa can afford to be less restrained
when they buy provisions in the village shop.
  That was an amazing deal.
  How much was that coffee, Alisa?
  Can I afford that now?
  Yeah, you can afford it.
At the quarry, the men's resentment has turned to fighting talk.
I'm wondering whether the steward actually imposes these fines,
then gets the money off the boss to pay us and pockets the fines himself.
It's up to everybody themselves but I think we should consider joining the union.
"A red mist is descending over the slate quarries of North Wales..."
Trade unions were particularly militant in the North Wales slate belt of 1890,
campaigning for better pay and safer working conditions.
"We want the Welsh spirit in the workers' fight. Fight your opposition."
Going to get started, then? Get some slate sorted?
Erm, we've been having a discussion, Mr Humphreys,
and we're not happy with the work situation here.
We're not happy with a number of things.
You can't make slates, and then you blame the slate itself, for being poor quarrymen.
  It's poor quality slate.
  You wouldn't know poor quality slate if it hit you in the eye.
  Our position is this...
  Your position is that you will work until the end of the month,
you have two days to go, or you leave now with nothing.
Things are changing.
We are now part of a union and that union is going to stand up for us.
You will not talk of unions here, I'm telling you now!
  North Wales...
  You will not talk of unions here!
We're not going out to work.
I'll be back in a few hours telling you to move from this quarry
or I will get the Constabulary here.
That is your position, OK?
The Steward has called their bluff.
It would have been a nightmarish thing to do in 1890,
to stand up to a quarry owner who had given you a hard time for years.
The other thing we've got to remember is that the person we're standing up to is our landlord,
which has an added factor for us because if it all goes wrong,
we'll be kicked out of our homes.
Rather than risk a confrontation with the Constabulary,
the men head for home.
At the school, the Government Inspector is marking the children's examination papers.
This is Leah's work. Very well presented.
Her handwriting is very good.
I have commented often in the past
on the excellence of her handwriting.
Then we have Ela's work here.
She has some difficulty keeping the blots away from her writing.
  And this is Jac.
  Her brother Jac.
  Jac's writing isn't as tidy.
  We have had problems, I'm afraid, with Jac's handwriting.
  And this is...
  Tommy's.
I notice that in the dictation, he's actually digressed from the script I was reading.
He appears to be having difficulties because that is not the way forward,
especially if he is to progress as a pupil teacher.
Exactly.
  I shall have a word with him.
  I would recommend that.
The school's future and Tommy's wage hang in the balance.
David Jones is checking on the family's flock of Welsh mountain sheep.
I'm a bit worried about this sheep and lamb here.
I'm just a bit concerned that she's not feeding.
I don't know if the mother has lost interest or...
The mother's not running over to me now and saying, "That's my lamb."
I'm not sure which one the mother is.
I wonder if this is mum here.
Just leave it for a minute and see if mum comes.
It's just not suckling, see.
Mum's wondering off when she's trying to suckle.
The lamb's very weak.
I don't think, you know, it's going to last much longer.
I think we have to get it inside.
David takes the lamb and its mother into the barn.
I'm just trying to get him to suckle.
I think it's one of Mark's, but it's whoever's nearest.
It' not a case of saying to Mark, "You've got to do it."
We've all got to chip in.
Otherwise, we're going to lose a lamb between us.
In 1890, if you had a smallholding and you had a few sheep,
you lose one lamb, that's a lot of income you've lost.
There you go.
The Joneses have embraced their role as 1890 smallholders.
I think we need to leave them in here.
The Braddocks are not natural farmers.
Leah has taken a shine to the family cockerel.
She's named it Billy.
Smallholders would rarely have shown such sentimentality
and Billy would have been destined for the pot.
She's on a sponsored walk tonight!
In the barn, Mark and Alisa are trying to milk their cow.
How much have we got? Nearly a bucket.
Watch your feet in case she'll kick you.
  She's a bronco today.
  She's been a nightmare.
It's like trying to milk a rodeo cow.
That's it, I'm off.
She's about to kick somebody. It's normally me.
The farmer said she might miss the other cow.
Would she want to go for a walk? Do you take cows for a walk?
Oh, a letter!
I think we should give it to Mami.
Next morning, Catrin's sister has sent her a letter,
together with a photograph of her niece.
The isolation of smallholding life is taking its toll.
Being in here has made me realise...
..how important my family is, and I'm missing them.
Thank you, Jac. Thank you.
The lamb that David rescued has survived the night.
Gareth, the farmer, has called by to offer advice.
There's a lot of wool here. There's too much of this wool.
If we get the shears tomorrow...
And because she's a young sheep, the first lamb for her,
she's not sure what to do, so she's a bit insecure about moving around.
Look at his little tail going now. He's happy, having a belly full.
He's a good little lamb, fair play.
He's going to survive, 100%.
In the close knit smallholding community,
a family's survival was often dependant on the kindness of neighbours.
Billy. Let me have a look at Billy!
But they, in return, expected payment in kind.
Gareth's got a hold of my cockerel and I don't trust him.
I hope he doesn't pull its neck.
See all the meat there? It's gorgeous. Breast tender.
I can't give Billy away.
Erm, it would break Leah's heart.
That would feed the whole family, that would.
Especially a hungry family.
To save Leah's tears, David Jones selects an alternative candidate.
That's not bad at all. A very decent breast on it.
Billy lives to see another day.
Rockabye chicken on the tree top
When the wind blows the cradle will rock...
It's the men's last working day at the quarry.
Tomorrow their slates will be counted and their pay calculated.
Rather than lose out completely, they've decided to put yesterday's confrontation behind them.
I want these men working flat out now.
It's last day tomorrow.
We want to see some quality slate and work being done today. C'mon.
The men know they won't meet their production target of 3,000 slates,
but have decided to make a concerted effort
to produce as many as possible in the time remaining.
Their purses buoyed with income from the sale of their geese,
Alisa and Catrin descend on the village shop.
We've got mints and we've got liquorish and barley sugar.
  Can I have a quarter of the liquorish, please?
  Yes.
I'm going to go crazy today. Can I try the bara brith? I've never tried it.
Can I have ten of the eating apples?
Five shillings, fourpence ha'penny.
Coffee, please, Mr Evans. Please. That's the first thing on my list.
They're quite expensive. One six a pound.
  Let's push the boat out. I'll have those.
  Treat yourself!
  Do you want some cakes?
  Yes. Five of those, please.
  Do you want some bread?
  Yes, I need quite a bit.
I'll have the lot, please. Thank you.
  Up to eleven shillings, fourpence ha'penny.
  Your bill comes to one pound, ten pence ha'penny.
  Lovely.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to need a wagon to get all this back.
Just give me a grand total, please, Mr Evans.
13 shillings and a ha'penny.
  Twelve, thirteen...
  And the ha'penny.
  You've got a penny there.
  Oh, lovely.
Nice to see you again.
  Take care. And you, Mrs Braddock.
  Yes. Thank you.
  We went wild.
  Very extravagant today.
I've got my coffee, so I'm happy.
That's all I really wanted but I've got a lot more.
I'm just wondering where I'm going to hide it
before the kids see it and eat it all.
You may sit down.
The results of the school inspector's examination have been returned.
Each and every one of us has a role to play in this school.
I am able to say that we have all been successful.
However, there are some matters that need to be addressed.
Pupil teacher, Tommy, is in trouble. He scored the lowest mark.
You know what let you down, don't you, Tommy?
  Yes, Sir.
  The dictation.
  Yes, Sir.
Will you come here, please?
If you are taking your role seriously as a pupil teacher, that is not the way to go ahead.
  No, Sir.
  No, it is not.
As it would have been in 1890, Tommy's weekly pay is docked to reflect his poor performance.
One shilling and eleven pence. Go and sit down.
At the quarry, the men's last working day is drawing to a close.
After a month's hard labour, they're glad to be leaving.
To be honest, I'm over the moon that it's coming to an end.
It's definitely not the job for me.
Quarry work is repetitive.
You're just splitting, dressing and shovelling,
split, dress, shovel.
That's what I've found difficult.
Getting to grips with the repetitiveness.
It's quite a miserable place
because you're working hard, the slate is wet and cold.
To do this day in, day out, rain, shine, snow,
they were hard, hard people.
We're doing it for just under a month.
They would have 25 or 30 years of this
and they must have been wracked with rheumatism, arthritis, all kinds of diseases,
but still they had to get up and do the walk.
I would imagine they would still laugh and joke because that's what kept them going.
Tomorrow is pay day and they're keen to get an idea
of how much they can expect to earn.
  Total is 2,524.
  That's good.
  Brilliant, isn't it?
  Superb.
They're some 500 slates short of their target of 3,000,
so they won't earn their hard negotiated full pay
of 34 shillings each, but they're not far off.
  Well done, boys. Good effort.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
Feeling flush, the Braddocks and the Joneses,
including Grandma Heulwen,
set aside their cares and step out for an evening's entertainment.
First, I have to collect some money. Tonight, you are going to see
for you delectation and delight,
Professor Hurd's Traveling Pictorium of Visual Delights
right up here on the screen.
A forerunner of moving pictures.
Magic lantern shows were all the rage in the early 1890s.
What you're going to see on the screen.
This is a French slide, this next one. I'll do this in French for you.
It's called The Dentist, by the way.
(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Ha ha ha ha! A ha! Ooh!
  Ooh!
  I bet that went down well during the French Revolution.
Crossing the Crumlin Viaduct.
It goes backwards as well.
Keep your eye there on that screen.
This little swan you see at the bottom of that screen there.
Foraging for food. Look how slippery it is on the ice. Terrible.
Shows were aimed at the whole family and covered a huge range of topics.
From temperance to travel.
Moral warnings and mechanical moving images.
The Mediterranean.
Aaah!
The Wonderful Wrestling Lion.
He goes like this. Aah!
After the constant toil and isolation of small holding life,
the evening is a welcome relief for the families.
That's enough of that!
It was just really amusing.
I can't believe they had, you know, pictures like that
and colourful pictures. I just thought it was really clever.
I think it was actually better than going to the cinema.
Yeah, it was very interesting.
Having not had any real entertainment for three weeks
  something like that was quite nice.
  Can you blow the candle out, please?
Thank you and goodnight.
With just two days of their 1890 adventure left,
the Braddocks' and the Joneses' spirits are rising.
Next time:
It's payday at the quarry.
Here's another one that's gone off here. It's basically useless, really.
  We hid a few at the back.
  Yeah, I think he'll clock them.
  They'll come out of their wages.
The landlord demands his rent.
If he's going to use his bully boy tactics to fine us...
  Muddy boots on the floor!
  Yeah.
  ..there's going to be hell to pay.
The best thing we've done, isn't it?
Apart from getting married and having kids!
Your heart is so full here.
There's like nowhere like this on earth.
