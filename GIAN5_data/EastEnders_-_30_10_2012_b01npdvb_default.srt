Who rattled your cage?
Rocky!
Someone's got a bit of tension to work off, is married life that good?
It's fine.
  All right, could be better. Happy now?
  Yes.
OK, I want you and Sy to come to the Vic tonight.
Because Kat and Alfie are insisting on having a Halloween party.
There's going to be themed cocktails,
"Thriller" on loop all night and a prize for best costume.
  You can bring Yas, come on.
  She's got her birthday party at nursery,
  so I'm sure she'll be too tired.
  Oh, come on!
Well, I suppose Mas is looking after her later.
Right, so all the more reason
for you to do something nice with just Syed, yeah? Think about it?
I'll think about it.
You and him are going to be fine.
OK? He wouldn't have said "I do" if...
Well, he didn't.
  That's terrible.
  I know.
  I'll see you soon.
  See you.
  Toast do you, love?
  Whatever.
Luce, Bob wants you
to fix a button on his Halloween costume or something.
He can wait. You wouldn't be able to take the afternoon off, would you?
The bank's relationship manager called last night
and asked to discuss "ongoing business arrangements".
And I would feel so much better if you're there.
Right, well, I can't let Max down, can I?
You'll be fine   you know your stuff.
  We can do something tonight. Hmm?
  We could see what Fats is up to, or see who else is about.
  Like Whitney?
All right.
How about we just keep it between me and you then, eh?
See you later on. Bye.
If you're...
If you're worried about the meeting, maybe I could help?
I'm not worried.
Right, so you've done projections for the next six months then?
Course. I have everything under control. I don't need you, Dad.
All right.
Phil!
Phil!
Phil!
So I'm thinking two for one for zombies and witches,
we'll get toffee apples in for the trick or treaters.
Have you thought this through? This isn't going to scare any one.
We have done this before, you know!
Sorry, I'm a bit tired. Tommy kept me up all night.
Yeah, he's not sleeping in his own room.
Every time we put him down he cries.
That's what happens when you leave them in with you too long.
Amy was well sleeping through by that point.
Thanks, Supernanny, we'll learn.
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, can we get back to Halloween?
It gives me great pleasure now to introduce
for the first time our very... Is he ready?
Yeah. Our very own ghost hunter...
the one and only...Fat Boy!
Look at this, eh?
What is going on, ghost hunters?
So, do you want to know about Walford's most haunted houses,
or most gruesome murder mysteries?
Well, Fats has got the story
on E20's most grisly and gruesome, spookiest spooks!
How good is that, eh?
See now, for a small fee, he'll take people round Walford,
give them some, like, you know, made up ghost stories.
They'll all be scared, they'll want to come in here
and drown their sorrows and have a drink.
  Is it going to be morbid?
  What, you not getting scared?
  Yeah, right, no!
  I've already signed some people up.
Look, look, got them all interested, look.
  Look at that, see. Well done, buddy.
  Show me.
Fine, fine. All right, fine.
Have you sorted the prizes for the costume competition?
Yeah. Tickets to London Dungeons for the kids
and a bottle of fizz for the grown ups.
Well, you might as well hand that over to me now.
Because no one out does Kimberley Fox when it comes to fancy dress.
Well, she does wear it most days.
Just cos you don't have my flair and imagination.
  Yes, I have plenty of imagination.
  Yes, you do.
  I I would imagine.
  Yeah.
My costume's going to blow your costume right out of the water.
Oh yeah? Well, come on then!
I don't know what she's having, but I want some!
I don't know why we should waste our money buying costumes.
  My kids made do with sheets.
  That's not even scary.
Come on, Nan, they'll look rubbish in those compared to everyone else.
  Please! They'll run out soon.
  Pleeease!
  Oh, all right.
  Yes!
  Cheers, mate.
  Listen, I need two.
Can you give me a discount on that?
  It just sounds a bit tacky, that's all.
Where's your sense of humour gone?
About time we had a night out.
We haven't had that much fun since the wedding.
Yeah, it's just with things the way they are  
Mum gone, me unemployed and in the doghouse.
I know, but that doesn't mean
we shouldn't spend quality time together.
Ha ha, your favourite!
I suppose a few hours won't hurt.
A duck!
A duck. I'll see you later.
  See you.
  See you.
  Thank you.
  Be a good girl for daddy.
  Bye.
  Bye.
Why haven't you been answering my calls?
  Because I've been out on a job.
  Well, I saw Sharon yesterday,
she said something about being on the residency application.
  What did she mean?
  I don't know.
She must've meant something. Is everything all right with Lexi?
Phil, if something's changed I've got the right to know.
You're being paranoid, OK.
Now, if you don't mind, I've got work to do.
Yeah, the thing is Marie, it's swamped in here.
No, if he has mumps, of course you should stay with him.
OK, I can manage.
One minute, sorry.
Thank you.
You should move those. Someone could trip and break something
and where there's a blame, there is a claim!
Thanks for the advice.
Oh. Been shopping yet?
Oh, sorry, forgot you don't have to try hard to look scary.
You won't be so cocky later when I'm sipping my champagne.
Oh, Lucy, just to warn you,
there's a PC in the area lecturing all the local businesses
about how to spot those counterfeit notes doing the rounds.
Took me ages to get him out the Minute Mart.
He's in the launderette now,
so he'll probably come to you next, yeah?
  So, is he fit?
  Hmm.
If you forget these one more time...
What will you do to me?
  What do you want?
  You know what I want   my money.
Well, I can't give you what I don't have.
I'm broke, my whole family's broke.
What if I was a bank, Syed?
I wouldn't let it go then, would I?
  I'd be seizing your assets.
  Yeah, well, good luck with that,
cos everything worth taking is already gone.
Oh, I don't know, you might be able to offer me something.
I will raise your cash somehow.
Anything to get you out of my life.
Well, until you do, you'll be hearing from me, all right?
Gotcha!
Listen, how about me and you
sneaking upstairs to our kiddie free bedroom, eh?
  Come on, only be gone ten minutes.
  Ten minutes? That sets a new record.
Yeah, it obviously includes the shower.
  Not interrupting anything, am I?
  All right, darling.
  All right, Carol. What can I get you?
  You haven't got any bar work going?
Sorry, no vacancies.
Sorry, it's not my decision.
  Roxy's in charge now.
  Since when?
It's a long story.
  Syed's mate, Danny, right?
  You've got a good memory.
Well, I never forget a pretty face. What can I get you?
I'll have a pint, please.
OK. So, what brings you back to Walford? You catching up with Syed?
Yeah, Something like that.
Can't have Christian monopolising his time just cos they're married.
  How is Christian?
  He's good, he's good.
  He'll be in later if you want to see him.
  I can't hang around
  but say hello to him for me.
  Yeah.
Take it there's been no more trouble in paradise?
Yeah, Lauren, what you said the other day,
about...about Lucy   you were right.
I ain't been fair, stringing her along like this.
So what you going to do?
End it.
What? No, I never said you should do that.
Joey, you can't just dump her!
No, look, Lauren, it's too late, all right.
Decision's been made.
We're taking Oscar trick or treating later, he'd love it if you came.
No, I'm not in the mood.
Look, if Phil said "Everything will be all right"
then I'm sure it will be.
He'll be doing everything he can to get Lexi back, won't he?
Suppose.
I'm sure she'll be back with you where she belongs before you know it.
Yeah and then you'll be taking her trick or treating.
  So this could be good practice.
  Mmm.
Do you think it's too late for us to pick up some costumes?
You've certainly changed your tune.
I'm just trying to get into the spirit of things,
  is there anything wrong with that?
  No, I like it.
You two seem to be getting on OK to me.
Seeing his mate must've cheered him up. Was it Danny?
He said to say hi to you.
  Danny was here?
  Yeah.
Then once we've been to the War Memorial,
we'll be back here for our grand finale.
Where it has been said that that Queen Vic bust has moved
from one side of the bar to the other, all by itself.
But more of that later. Any questions?
  No? Then let's go...
  Actually, I've got some questions, Fats.
Why's the time of this tour been brought forward?
Isn't it a bit more, like, atmospheric in the dark?
Or...or is it too scary? Huh, huh?
Plus you don't want to miss out
on all the party action that's going on in here.
You know, the fancy dress and that.
OK, so, have experts actually confirmed any supernatural presence
  in any of the places you're taking us?
  Yeah.
Of...of course. The guy...
the medium guy from the TV...
Derek Anaconda has confirmed it as a hotspot.
So, let's go...come on.
Let's go, ghosts and ghouls.
Let's get out of here.
OK, let's go...
What?
I'm sorry but I can't give you anything.
This is a business, not a sweet shop.
You're sounding more like Ian every day. Come on, kids.
Oh, hi.
So where did this meeting take place exactly?
It wasn't a meeting   he just showed up here.
So he was here in this house
and you didn't think that worth mentioning to me?
Because I knew you'd react like this.
Why didn't you tell me that you still owed him money?
On top of everything else?
  I was embarrassed.
  We said "No more lying", Sy!
I know and I'm sorry, but...
I thought he'd get bored. I thought he'd get bored, drop it.
Where the hell are we supposed to find more cash from?
It's not even about that.
With Danny it's all about the power games,
I think that's what he gets off on.
So when he was here, what happened?
He tried winding me up, I didn't rise to it.
Nothing else happened, if that's what's you're thinking.
  I wasn't.
  The best thing we can do is ignore him.
Look, he'll lose interest.
Let's just go back to this party at the Vic.
"United front", like you said.
We're married.
It's time we started to act like it, agreed?
Agreed.
Again, I'm so, so sorry.
Look, here's your cash back
and if you want to send us the dry cleaning bill then...
Oh, Luce, don't let him do this to you.
What?
Joey. If he doesn't want you then he's an idiot, isn't he?
There's plenty more fish in the sea and all that.
Maybe we could go for a drink later or something?
If you want?
Joey wants to break up with me?
Oh. I I...I don't know.
  I could've easily got that wrong, Lucy. I...
  Just go.
Oh, look at you, girl.
You weren't joking about going all out, were you?
Get a grip.
The important thing   the tills are ringing
and Fats'll be back with the ghost walkers soon.
Here we go, one for you, one for you, one for you.
See you later, kids. Bye.
Here you are.
  Oh, no, thanks.
  Yeah, no.
What? You two are such wusses.
Right, let's go see what we can get down the Minute Mart, yeah?
  Yeah.
  Come on then.
  Just follow you, yeah?
  Follow me.
  Ready?
  All right.
THIS is very spot
of Jack The Ripper's first grisly murder.
And that, my friends, concludes our tour.
If you'd like to follow me into the Vic,
  where reasonably priced refreshments await...
  I don't remember
  any Jack The Ripper murder victims being found round here.
  Well, yeah...
That's because it's one of his very, very first, lesser known crimes.
You know, before he got X Factor famous.
And we've barely covered the more recent murders around Walford.
One of my clients at the salon says the Vic's been haunted for years.
Get this, at least two of the landlords
have been murdered in there, you know?
One was buried in the cellar and the current manager's dad
was bludgeoned to death at Christmas a few years ago.
But that doesn't make it a bad place to drink.
It's a great place to drink, you see?
Those ghosts, they've probably come to peace with their fate.
Yeah, they're probably gone, so...
  Does that mean Heather's flat is still haunted?
  What?
She only died a few months ago. She hasn't had time to make peace.
She's right, you know, that is so sad.
I bet she still roams round her old place, lost and alone,
calling for George.
  Is that true?
  No, of course not!
No, there's no such things as ghosts.
But it is Halloween!
  Don't encourage them, Liam.
  Well, well, well,
why don't we continue this conversation inside the Vic, hey?
That is of course after we visit the very famous,
the very haunted car lot.
You see, where it is rumoured a person died in a fire.
Yes, very true.
It's a very long tale so follow me, I shall tell you.
See, before we get there...
I came as quick as I could. What's wrong?
I need some advice.
OK, right, so what is it?
Current profits, future projections...?
Something else?
  No, no, this is important.
What you need to remember, OK,
is even if your profits are going down, all our businesses...
All your businesses, OK, they have the potential to make money.
Now, banks, they like money, therefore they like you.
Roxy's going to kill us for not dressing up, you know!
  If you continue to follow me this way...
I don't know how he gets away with that nonsense.
Still, it's harmless enough, I suppose.
These two have got the right idea.
Listen, how about we check out this party in the pub?
They're bound to have some sweets in here.
  Come on, Kat and Alfie won't bite.
  Come on, Tiff.
Come on, what you doing?
  Seems to be going well.
  That's cos I'm running the show, isn't it?
I'm going to give her a slap if she's not careful.
  Oi, violence isn't the answer, all right?
  Ooh, ooh!
Looks like I was wrong about Kat and Alfie.
They might bite you after all.
What is the matter with you two all of a sudden?
  I'm only joking.
  What are you doing with my kids?
That isn't...
  Oi, oi!
  Take them off.
I'm so sorry, I thought they were my...
Are you all right, sweetheart?
No, I've lost Tiff and Morgan!
I'll be back.
All right? Where's Christian?
He had to go back to the gym on some emergency, he won't be long.
Sorry, lads, for the inconvenience,
but we gotta do some maintenance work.
  See you tomorrow.
  Take care.
  Yeah, take it easy.
What's the matter?
You expecting someone else?
  Thanks for coming.
  Thank you.
Well?
He's looking forward to help me build on the Beale empire.
Hee hee, well done.
  Thanks for what you did.
  No, you did it, Lucy, not me.
Erm...
Joey's heading home in a bit.
He wants to know if it'll just be the two of us.
Bobby's at the school Halloween party
for another couple of hours, OK? I'll go park myself in the Vic,
which means you two can have the place to yourself
until I pick him up, all right?
Dad, did you ever regret trying so hard with Mum,
even when you knew it was over?
Nah.
Look...
I might've been a bit of an idiot, but...
I just didn't want it to end, OK?
Look, I'm really good at business, right?
But when it comes to romantic relationships, I am rubbish.
We both know that and thank heavens, right?
You're not me.
If you want me I'll be in the Vic, all right.
OK, ladies and gentlemen, if you come through to the...bar,
where cocktails are two for one.
So enjoy, enjoy, come through.
Kim, darling, you wouldn't get the drinks in for us, would you?
What? Proper fancy dress, getting the rounds in  
  I'm liking the new and improved Denise more and more.
  Yeah.
Mmm mmm, look at you! Look at you!
You are like cocoa butter for the body, you're needed...
  Not here!
  What?
Don't you think it's about time we stopped all this sneaking around
and just go public with it?
I know how I'm feeling   I'm feeling the vibe
and I kind of want to share those good vibes...
  Or not, um, if you're not ready. Forget it...
  Arthur.
You know that...
we can never be a PROPER item?
Yeah, but, you know...
No, you're too young...
for me to get serious with.
I'm sorry, I should never have led you on.
So how about we just end things now, on good terms? Yeah?
  Or, what if...?
  No, no what ifs.
Let's just keep it as a LOVELY memory.
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
  There's no sign on Turpin Road.
  Why don't we try the allotments?
How could I let this happen?
There's loads of kids running around in skeleton outfits right now.
They must be really scared, it's Halloween. Where've they got to?
I think I know where they are.
Liam?
No calls, no texts and you stay away from our home,
  do you understand me?
  I'm quite disappointed in Syed,
sending his Muscle Mary to do his dirty work.
He didn't.
I just thought you should be reminded that you are not welcome round here.
Now you will get your money when we have it.
Until then, you stay away.
  Do I really threaten you that much?
  Please!
I must do, going behind Syed's back to warn me off.
It's quite sad really...
an ageing old queen so desperate to hang onto his pretty boy
that he'll do anything to scare off the competition.
Competition? You kissed(!)
Hardly makes you the romance of the century.
Is that what he told you it was?
A kiss?
Oh, it was more than that, much more.
Why did you come here?
  We wanted to talk to Heather's ghost.
  Sorry.
Listen, you take them straight home!
  I'm going to have a big brandy.
  This one's on the house.
You can say it as many times as you like, that doesn't make it true.
Did you ever wonder why Syed looked elsewhere?
He must have been so bored with his life.
You don't know anything about him.
And you do?
You want a homebody.
Syed's not like that   he's a high flyer, a gambler.
Why else do you think he took a risk on me?
Or maybe he wanted to get caught.
You ever thought about that?
This conversation...
..is over.
If he comes calling again, I won't say no
and it's only a matter of time before he does.
You may have been able to guilt Syed into marriage
but you can't force him
to like your cosy, boring, little life that you lead.
He'll always be looking over your shoulder, wanting more.
And if it isn't me that'll give it to him, it's someone else.
What's all this?
Helping you leave.
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
Not like this, Lucy.
Then how?
Look, we were never meant to be a big thing, all right?
Look, I didn't make any promises.
I know, I was just someone to bunk with.
That was fine for a while, but that's not enough for me any more.
Right, well, I should go.
Maybe it doesn't matter...
that only one of us feels it.
Maybe that is enough?
You know it don't work like that, Luce.
If Bianca was here, she'd kill me!
We all make mistakes, Carol.
Anybody who claims to be a perfect parent is either deluded or lying.
You've changed a bit while I've been away.
You don't know the half of it.
Here, Denise, there's your Halloween match, you gotta make a move.
He's a total stranger.
I thought you was starting to mix it up a bit, get a bit crazy.
Eh? What happened to the new and improved Denise?
Well, few more of these.
Rome weren't built in a day, was it?
There you go, Fats, all yours, mate. Well done, proud of ya. Good stuff.
What's the matter, Fats?
What, me? Nothing, man!
I'm Fats, man, I'm never down, you know how I roll.
All right, look...
I was seeing this lady
and I thought it was going somewhere but it just didn't work out.
Oh, Fats.
  I suppose we can't all have vampire love that lasts forever, eh?
  Yeah.
Mmmm.
So what have I done to deserve this, eh?
I can be nice to my husband, can't I?
You wait until I get you upstairs alone later.
That's if we ever get Tommy to sleep through, darling.
He will.
You and me are going to spend some quality time together, all right.
Things are going to work out, Alfie.
No, I can't get an answer either.
This is ridiculous.
Don't eat all them at once.
Ta! See ya.
So what do you want, then?
because I thought it'd help with getting Lexi back.
You need to get real, Lola. Social services, they look at you,
they don't see a good, secure family unit.
Whereas if me and Sharon was together,
Yeah, I know, me too.
And I...I screwed up.
You know, relying on Sharon but that's my fault.
Not yours.
Wait, what we going to do now then?
You ain't got a clue, have you?
Trick or treat?
Excuse me.
Christian?
