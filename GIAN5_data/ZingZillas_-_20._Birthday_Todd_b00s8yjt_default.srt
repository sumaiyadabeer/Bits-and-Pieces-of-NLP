It's my birthday! It's my birthday!
Happy birthday, me!
I wonder how many birthday cards I got?
Oh. Not one.
Hmm. Everyone's forgotten.
Ah, well. Back to work.
OK, Todd's gone inside. It's safe to talk now.
Why is everything so secret today?
  Because we have to plan what we're going to do.
  Do? About what?
  Oh.
  What?
  It's Todd's birthday.
  Todd's birthday? Nobody told me.
  Let's go and celebrate.
  No! We're planning a birthday party for Todd,
but it's a really big surprise. So we don't want him to know.
Oh, right. A surprise.
So, what do we need for the party?
Oh! Yum yum!
  Cake!
  A cake. We need a cake.
Balloons. DJ can blow up balloons for us.
Yeah! And we need some streamers. Can I do them?
Yes, that's a great idea, Zak.
  And we need a song.
  A birthday song.
  A birthday song.
Hmm. That's trickier. I know, let's work out the words first.
  I like parties and streamers.
  And presents and cards.
Joining in with all your birthday games.
  Musical statues.
  I've got one. Pass the parcel too.
Open up your eyes... And you'll discover a surprise.
Happy birthday.
What about "it's your birthday"?
  Oh, yeah! It's your birthday
  Yes, it's true
  So happy birthday
  Happy birthday
From all of us ZingZillas to you.
Hmph! Those ZingZillas upstairs are so busy
they've forgotten my birthday.
Oh, well. I've got no time to celebrate today.
It's time for me to fix the drains.
Ooh! Ah!
  Did somebody hear a crash?
  It's Todd. He's working downstairs.
We need to be really careful, or he'll find out about the party.
So what do we do?
OK. We need to get organised. Tang, we've got the words,
  but you need to come up with a good tune for the party song.
I'll make the cake. Zak, you do the balloons and streamers.
  Let's do it!
Uh, what Drum do?
  Oh, Drum. We almost forgot. You have the most important job of all.
  Oh.
You need to keep Todd away from the clubhouse
  and make sure he doesn't find out about the big party surprise.
  Hello!
  Oh!
What's going on here?
Erm...er...
I've come to check your drains.
Hi, Todd. We've just heard that, erm...the Beach Byrds
they need help at the coconut hut. It's urgent. There's a big problem.
Urgent? A big problem, eh? Well, I'd better go.
No, no. Don't stop me. Clear the waaa aay!
  Keep an eye on him, Drum. He mustn't find out about the party.
  Here comes Todd.
  And here comes coconut number one.
Three more to go.
I hope those ZingZillas can keep Todd's birthday party a secret
until big zing time.
What was that?
  I hope they can keep your birthday...
  Silence!
Did you say something about a birthday?
  Er...
  Erm, no.
Oh, I see.
Hmm, nobody seems to have remembered. Oh, well.
Right now I'm busy. Big problem at the coconut hut.
  Sshh!
  Hmm.
  Sorry!
The coconut hut is fabulous The coconut hut is marvellous
The coconut hut is free for all At the coconut hut you'll have a ball
Snacks and nuts and juices Bring friends or come alone
The hut is DJ Loose's But we like to call it home
The coconut hut is fabulous The coconut hut is marvellous
Day or night it's always right Never shut, it's the coconut hut.
Hm. Well, I've had a look. There's nothing for me to fix here.
Yes. Sorry about that.
Right. I'd better go and get on with my next job.
Hello. Hi, Tang.
Hey, Drum. You're doing great!
  Don't let Todd near his birthday surprise.
  Birthday surprise?
  Oh, hi, DJ.
We're planning a surprise birthday party for Todd.
Panzee's making a cake. Zak is doing the decorations...
And you're hanging out at the coconut hut.
  Oh, no. I need some help.
  Don't we all!
Yes. Well, we've got the words for a great birthday song, but no tune.
It needs to be some really, really special music.
Really, really... Oh me, oh my! Have I got something special for you.
If you're looking for party music, meet me in the glade.
Uh uh.
Hi, Mr Granite, Mr Gravel.
You haven't mentioned the surprise party?
  Uh, no. No, no, no, of course not.
  Great!
  Phew!
  Look out! It's coconut number two.
Two more to go. Tang needs to hurry up with that music.
Hurry up, Tang. Hurry up!
Whoa!
  Hey, Tang.
  Hi, DJ.
  Now, Tang, you want party music?
You're about the hear the best party music in the world,
played by my old friends the Silk Street Hot Seven.
So, what sort of music is it?
It's called traditional jazz, or trad jazz,
invented way before you were born
  and still making the swingy ist, party ist music around.
  Cool!
"The Saints Go Marching In"
Listen to that trumpet! The clarinet! Oh, it's really, really...
bouncy and swingy! They make me want to dance!
Yes, and what do you like to do at a party?
Dance! Whoo hoo!
It's trad jazz, you can't keep still.
My fingers are tingling and my toes are tapping.
Party on, guys!
That's it! That's the sort of tune I've been looking for.
We can play a trad jazz party song for Todd.
I've got to tell the others.
  Thanks, DJ.
  No problem, Tang, my friend. No problem at all.
Wheeeee!
Oh.
Hey, everybody. I've discovered the perfect party music.
Great! And I have the perfect mixture for the perfect birthday cake.
And my party decorations rock!
  Drum!
No, Drum. I must get on with my work.
It's Todd. He's back, and he's coming up and the cake's not ready!
  What do we do? What do we do?
  He mustn't see the party decorations,
  or the cake. We're not ready yet.
  But what do we do?
  Get rid of all the party things. Quick!
  Right. Quick.
Hurry! Quickly!
THEY GASP My cake!
Oh, er... Hi, Todd. Are you OK?
Mmm. Interesting.
I'm fine, Panzee. Little accident.
I'll be with you as soon as I've cleaned up.
Don't let Todd of your sight, Drum.
That was too close. He almost found out about his birthday surprise.
THAT was going to be my lovely cake!
Well, there's still time to make another one, Panzee.
We've got the flour, the eggs, the sugar for the cake.
We've still got the decorations.
And I've got the best music in the world for a surprise party.
  So let's play!
  Nuts and bananas
  Savoury and sweet
Blowing out the candles On your cake
  Jelly and ice cream
  Playing with your friends
Colourful balloons and lots of happy birthday tunes
It's your birthday It's your birthday
It's your birthday Yes, it's true
So happy birthday Happy birthday
From all of us ZingZillas to you.
Oh... Oh!
Here comes Todd.
You don't think Todd might guess there's going to be a party
if he spots the hats we're wearing?
TODD COUGHS Oh oh oh!
Well, I can't see anything that needs fixing round here.
Nice hats, gentlemen!
Oh... Are you going to a party?
  Oh, yes...
  No!
  No...
  Yes, that's right, it's no.
Oh, right...
But you do look like you're going to a birthday party.
I... Oh!
  Oh, sorry, Granite.
  Oh!
No, no... Hold it, hold it, hold it!
Now, Drum, settle down.
Now, tell me what this is really about.
Party hats on the Stones...
..birthday cake mixture on my head...
..party music in the Glade.
I think this all might have something to do with my birthday.
  Am I right?
  Erm...
Hmm... I think there's a party being planned, isn't there?
And it's my party, you've remembered after all!
How thrilling.
I need to get over to the Clubhouse right now.
Todd!
  That's the cake done.
  But we still haven't finished
putting up the balloons or the streamers.
  Oh oh, it's Todd! He's on his way back.
  Oh...
  He's coming this way.
  But we're not ready. Quick, get rid of everything.
  He mustn't see anything.
  Oh...
  Oh, quick!
  Where do we put the decorations?
  Get rid of them before Todd sees them.
Now, come on, Drum, it's MY birthday.
Can't I see what's going on up there?
Whoa...
  What about the cake?
  We need to get rid of it, quick.
Not out there, Zak!
Ohh...!
That's a very strange party hat Todd's wearing.
I don't think it's a party hat.
But if they want a party, they'd better hurry up.
Look, there's coconut number three!
Only one more to go before the Big Zing.
Hurry up, ZingZillas!
Sorry about the mess, Todd.
We wanted it to be a birthday surprise.
And now everything's ruined   the cake, the decorations...
Oh, don't worry, Panzee. I'm just thrilled you remembered.
Oh, but now there's not going to be a party.
No decorations, no cake, no surprise.
But you remembered my birthday, Panzee,
and that's the important thing.
  Oh...
  And we do still have our special birthday music to play.
Oh, would you like to hear it, Todd?
I'd love to hear it, Tang.
So what are we waiting for, ZingZillas?
Come on, let's party!
Oh, did you hear that, Granite?
  There's going to be a party after all.
  Oh, lovely...
And just in time, here comes...the last coconut!
It's time for the Big Zing!
ZingZillas!
ZingZillas!

"It's Big Zing time!"
