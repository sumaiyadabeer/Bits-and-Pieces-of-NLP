Welcome to Westminster for the January edition of Scottish
Questions. Proceedings in the Commons this week have a Celtic
feel to them, tomorrow, MPs debate the plans to give Holyrood more
powers. Today, the Scottish Secretary was at the dispatch box
fielding questions on a variety of topics, including the state of the
economy. Here is how it went... Order, questions to the Secretary
of State for Scotland. Question number one... Briefly before
answering, I want to pay tribute to Phil Gallie, whose passing has been
announced this week. He served this house and his party well while here
but also went on in the Scottish Parliament to serve his party and
his constituents with distinction and he did that rare but important
thing, while being an offender of his party on all sorts of things,
he was popular across party lines. Our condolences go to his family.
Economic growth is at the centre of the Government's agenda for this
Parliament and I promote this agenda in my regular engagements
with the business committee, in Scotland the UK and with
international partners. I also joined the Secretary of State in
his condolences for Phil Gallie because he was a fellow MP from
Ayrshire. You mention the efforts to promote jobs, can you opted the
house with what you have done to follow up the vice premier as a
visit from China, in particular the trade links between Scotland and
China? A very significant part of the visit and he welcomed it
enthusiastically, was that he started this in Scotland and I had
the privilege of welcoming him to the UK on behalf of the Government.
In the course of that visit, we were able to see very clearly the
opportunities for us to develop our planned as partners for growth
either in renewable energies or other streams. I want to add my
condolences to the family of Phil Gallie, we came into this place on
the same day and I must say, he was more working class than most Labour
MPs are today. And he was a feisty fighter as well. Can I ask the
Secretary of State whether or not he thinks that inward investment to
Scotland would be helped if they remained Glasgow Airport the Robert
Burns airport? From one great defender of Ayrshire to another. I
think that the family will be pleased to hear the tributes being
paid to foul Calais and as far as his idea for the renaming of the
airport is concerned, I'm sure those who make those decisions will
have heard that carefully. north east of Scotland and Aberdeen
is a powerhouse of the UK economy, providing tax revenue and inward
investment. Crucial to the future of attracting inward investment is
good communication technology. Will he discuss with me the barriers
that mean Aberdeen has not yet seen the next generation of broadband?
agree with him but the importance of Aberdeen and the regional
economy, not just for Scotland but the UK as a whole, is right to be
emphasised. I met with business leaders a few weeks ago to discuss
the issues in developing growth and broadband is an important part. He
will be aware of speeding up super  fast broadband and I will be
delighted to meet with him. They wish to associate myself and my
colleagues with the condolences for Phil Gallie. Does the Secretary of
State wish to understand that thousands of businesses the length
and breadth of Scotland suffer because of rocketing fuel prices?
recognise that the increase in prize is a challenge for
individuals and business. Which is why the Government is looking
carefully at ways in which we can tackle that issue, including
examining proposals for a fuel duty stabiliser. It was two years ago
that the Lib Dems promised their role fuel duty derogation. What
action has the UK government taken with the UK at the OTRs to secure
this and specifically has a formal request be made to the European
Commission to make this possible? The importance is for Scotland and
the whole of the UK to get a regime for fuel that reflects the
challenges, particularly in rural parts. On the area of derogation,
he will be aware of the Government works hard in insuring we can get
the right processes in Europe so we can get that pad it up and running
quickly. I welcome the Government's moves towards a lower rate of fuel
duty for the Adams but under the plans, feel a duty will go up by
more than 4p per litre. The rural economy could not stand at increase
so I hope the Secretary of State will tell the Chancellor not to go
ahead with this increase. I know the particular challenges in my
friends areas, with some other house prices of fuel in the whole
country. His representations to me and the Chancellor are carefully
noted and the decision on the future of fuel duty welcome at the
Budget. Good transport links to other parts of the UK are vital for
the Scottish economy. As the Secretary of State is aware, I
wrote to him and the Secretary of State for Transport on Monday last
week to express my concerns about reports that the MIA is about to
axe its Glasgow Heathrow service, putting over 100 jobs at risk. To
date, I have had no reply. Can he inform the House as to what steps
he and his Government are taking to persuade both the empire and the
British Airport Authority to save this connection? The M I.
recognise those concerns. Not just in Glasgow but across Scotland. I
have spoken to senior managers and it is clear that they have got some
difficult contractual arrangements as a result of the review of
landing charges at Heathrow. I am keen that they recognise the
importance of these links to Glasgow and Scotland.
ungrateful for the response but given the fact that there is
increasing evidence that domestic air links between Scotland and the
UK's largest airport might be diminished with inevitable worries
that this will result in increased fares, with only one remaining
carrier, would take a picnic to make contact with the European
Union, who are responsible for regulation, and asked them to
consider possible changes to better protect strategically important
domestic air links and ensure better competitive practices to
protect Scotland's economy and its customers? I amateur that I
remember her government doing this previously and I don't want to lose
sight of the fact that Glasgow, at that and other Scottish cities
London airports. Substantial links which we want to enhance and grow.
This issue is one of concern and we will continue to discuss that with
the parties involved. This is a question about devolution in
Scotland. I will answer a question to and question six together.
Coalition agreement had a commitment to implement the
recommendations of the Cameron Commission and the Government
introduced the bells of St Andrew's Day in 2010, the Scotland Bill will
have its second reading tomorrow and I look forward to members
taking part. I welcome the provisions in the Scotland Bill to
make the Scottish Parliament more fiscally accountable but can my
friend gave me reassurance that the business community on both sides of
the border will be fully consulted about the implementation of the tax
powers so that they do not suffer any undue burden? I welcome my
honourable friend's comments and I know that he has more than a
passing interest in these powers and I can give him the insurance
that he wants in terms of the high  level implementation group which
brings together experts from a range of bodies and also through
the HMRC Technical Group, we're consulting carefully and taking on
board all of the comments. It is a damaged that the board at formal is
a longer reflected fairly, so constituents like mine received
many millions of pounds less than equivalent areas in Scotland. Does
the Minister have any plans to amend the Scotland Bill to put the
allocation on to their basis of need? I feel sure that he can be
dextrous enough to provide replied... No...!
recommendations of the Calman Commission are not being
implemented, they are not in the Scotland Bill and the proposal on
levies being abandoned, the proposals for the marine
environment, abandoned. On air passenger duty, abandoned. This is
a lack of imagination on the part of this government or a lack of
ambition for Scotland? He certainly do not lack ambition for Scotland,
what we have is a set of proposals that have been thoroughly
scrutinised in the Scottish Parliament and they will be
scrutinised here as well and on the aggregates levy, he will be aware
with the court case at the present time we say it's not proper to
devolve but we will do so in the future. This is a question about
the rise in VAT. Can I associate myself with the comments about Phil
Gallie. He was a true great Conservative in Scotland. I have
regular discussions with the Chancellor of Exchequer a range of
issues and the VAT rise is a tough but necessary step towards
Britain's economic recovery. Income tax and national insurance
increases would have had a more damaging impact on poorer people in
our society. Almost half of respondents to a recent survey said
they would increase prices due to the VAT rise and 45% said they
would decrease turnover and have an obvious impact on hindering job
creation. How can the Secretary of State and the Minister continued to
sell out the people of Scotland and support this abysmal tax rise?
can the Honourable Gentlemen continue to fail to take
responsibility for his Government's record which took our country to
the brink of bankruptcy and required the VAT rise to fill the
black hole? If anyone is responsible for the issues that
Scottish business faces, it is his government. This question is about
business confidence from Fiona Bruce, the Tory MP. A will answer
question 4, 7 and 9 together. Returning the UK to sustainable
growth is the Government's overriding priority. The Government
is doing everything it can to create the conditions that enable
all businesses to be successful and create jobs. This is organisations
welcome the Government's plans to reduce the headline rate of
corporation tax and simplified tax. Does the Minister agree that these
cuts are vital for boosting enterprise? I welcome my friend's
comments and I wish to reinforce the points made by my Right
Honourable Friend for a moment ago that the priority to get economic
growth is to cut the deficit we inherited from the party opposite.
£155 billion but cuts in corporation tax and reducing the
national insurance burden and keeping interest rates are low are
very important for that package. The Tory MP for Carlisle... Were
then and Mr a agree that the Scottish government is following
the policies of the national government in encouraging private
sector investment and insuring a balanced economy? We certainly
believe that the private sector has a central role to play in returning
us to sustainable growth in this country, whether it to Scotland for
the rest of the UK. The Scottish Parliament debates the Scottish
budget this afternoon and these points will be made then. Is the
Minister worried that the Scottish Government's plans to introduce a
business surcharge will damage business confidence? I am very
confident these representations will be debated extensively this
afternoon. A double dip in the housing market in Scotland would be
a disaster for the country, what discussions has the Secretary of
State had were Scottish banks in relation to more flexible lending?
The Honourable Gentleman will be familiar with the situation that we
inherited, with bank lending not in a good state. We are determined to
increase the amount of lending. I have regular discussions with banks
on a range of issues and this is a central part of those discussions.
What the Secretary of State except that business confidence will have
been extremely dented by yesterday's appalling growth
figures. And will he accept that the Government's cuts go too far,
too fast and will his government pull back from this reckless
course? I recognise that yesterday's growth figures were
very disappointing indeed. We have said for months that the recovery
would be choppy. Special circumstances in yesterday's
announcement about the weather should be noted but if we do not
tackle the deficit and do not introduce the measures to help
businesses groat, we do not invest in infrastructure and science
funding, we will not get the recovery from the situation be
inherited. In the last dancer he referred to investment in
infrastructure. He will know from the Scottish business organisations
that run London today appearing before the select committee that an
important part of getting that confidence is the right transport
links and access to markets. Given the future of the Secretary of
State for Wales not withstanding, witty clear up the confusion over
his position on high speed and its extension to Scotland? I know from
the discussions weeks ago the people from Glasgow and Edinburgh
are confused as to where he stands. Could he clear this up and put on
record his support for high speed been extended to Edinburgh and
I was very pleased to arrange the meeting with the leaders of Glasgow
and Edinburgh councils with my Right Honourable friend, the
Transport Secretary. I'm absolutely a passionate supporter of high 
speed rail as is the Transport Secretary and the rest of the
Cabinet. This is a question about university fees. The UK Government
is developing a white paper on higher education in England, which
will fully consider the effect of its proposals on higher education
in the devolved administrations. I'm grateful to the minister. He
will know, as I do, that the tripling of university fees in
England brings nothing but pain and misery to Scottish universities and
students, whether through funding or pressure putting the Scottish
Government to respond. What has he got to say to the students of the
universities who will suffer because of the appalling decisions
that his party have taken and the Scottish liberals? What I have to
say is that higher education in Scotland is devolved. The UK
Government will    is taking account of its    the impact of its
policies in Scotland, but I tend to agrew    agree with the Brown
Report and it is a follower not a leader. There is a
constant noise. People outside must think it is very rude. The minister
should be aware that what of course is not devolved is the impact of
research funding not least for those Russell Group universities in
Scotland of the decisions which have been arrived at here in
Westminster. Will he give us an undertaking that he will ensure
that the Secretary of State for Scotland stays closely in touch
with Mike Russell's all party working group at Holyrood, so that
whatever the political composition after May, we get an outcome for
the Scottish universities, which does not replicate sadly the errors
of policy judgment which have been arrived at here? I'm happy to give
him the undertaking on the Scotland Office liasing with the Scottish
Parliament committee. Also, to assure him that the Scotland Office
works closely with universities on all issues affecting universities
in Scotland. This is a question about bank bonuses. I've answer
questions eight and 12. I have regular discussions with colleagues
on a range of issues as the predominant shareholder in RBS the
Government expects the bank to be a back marker on bonuses. People
across the country are having to make adjustments. Everyone expects
bankers to be part of this process. I thank the minister for the answer.
Given the FSA report finding there were 1.1 million complaints against
RBS in one year and over 50% of those were shown to have been dealt
with inappropriately, does the minister think it's appropriate for
the executives to receive lavish bonuses this year and if not, what
is he going to do about it? Well, the nature of bonuses, we have made
it clear that firstly with RBS, we are inherited a situation which was
an arrangement that was put in place by the last Government to pay
bonuses. His Government, not this one. We want to see them lower this
year than last year. That is absolutely clear cut. As far as
customer service is concerned, he makes an important point and I'm
sure that RBS managers will have heard it. Would the minister agree
that with the collapse of the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of
Scotland, an independent Scotland would be as successful as Ireland
and Iceland at the moment? This is a question about the driving
standards agency. My honourable friend, the Parliamentary under
secretary has agreed to look further into the arrangements
surrounding driving test centre closures. I thank the minister for
that response. But he's obviously aware that rural areas such as
Angus, local test centres are being closed without if any consultation
whatsoever, and services moved to multi purpose test centres. Will he
accept it's unacceptable for a Government agency to act and press
the Secretary of State for Transport, who is sitting along
from him, to impropose a moratorium until at the very least there is
adequate consultation with local communities before the removal of
such important services? I commend the honourable member on his
diligence in pursuing this issue as he did in his Westminster debate.
He knows that the minister took away the issues that he raised in
that debate and agreed to look into it. This is another question about
the recent visit of the vice premier of China to Britain and
Edinburgh. It visit was another positive step in strengthening
relationships and confirms Scotland's reputation as a world
leader in the continuing development and application of new
technology, which helps collect, deliver clean, green energy
globally. I thank the Secretary of State, but does he agree with me
that investment worth £6 million in Scottish companies by the largest
energy consumer in the world is a perfect show case for the benefits
of green technology? Given that Edinburgh looks set to see the
creation of a renewable energy cluster, that this only furthers
the case for Edinburgh to be the location for the new green
investment bank? There is just far too much noise. It is
very unfair on honourable members asking a question and on the
minister answering it. It sends out a very bad singal to those
listening. On the first point, may I emphasise my earlier remarks, the
vice premier was very impressed by what he saw of Scotland's renewable
energy sector when he visited Edinburgh. Not just in
presentations about the country's potential, but more specifically
see the Polaris affect Friday in Leith. Secondly, he makes a strong
case about the bank and we'll announce details of that shortly.
We look forward to making an announcement about the location at
an appropriate moment. I welcome, but support what the Secretary of
State has says about the establishment of the green
investment headquarters in Edinburgh. Would he not accept that
given the fact that leading economists this morning have said
that Scotland faces an even greater danger of a double dip recession,
but the decision on the bank should be taken sooner rather than later
and we want it set up to getle jobs in now, not in three or four years'
time. Unlike the previous Government, we have actually made a
firm commitment to the green investment bank and we intend to
deliver on that. We'll make a further announcement on the detail
as soon as poll.    possible. are taking forward the
recommendations of the Commission in the Scotland Bill. Will my
honourable friend take the opportunity to revisit the
boundaries between reserved and devolved areas in farming matters?
Do the minister believe, Mr Speaker, that we in England can benefit from
the way in which the Common Agricultural Policy has been
applied in Scotland? The Commission looked at issues in respect across
the full spectrum and determined that there was no need to make any
changes in respect of agriculture, other than in respect of a certain
aspect of animal health funding. I want to hear Mr
Robert Hallfon. The Tory MP for Harlow and he's talking about the
financial accountibility of the Scottish Parliament. The most
recent representations related specifically to the financial
provisions of the Scotland Bill received around the time of its
introduction on 30th November 2010. Since May of last year, Scotland
office ministers have not received any representations from Scottish
ministers stkrieshing the detail or estimated economic impact of any
proposals to deliver accountibility to the Scottish Parliament.
average the Government spends about £7,000 a year on somebody in
England. But it spends about £8 ,500 on somebody in Scotland. What
comfort can the minister give to my constituents that their money is
being spent wisely? The Government understands that there have been
concerns expressed about the Barnet formula, but the Government's
priority is the stablisation of the public finances and that is a
priority for this Parliament. the VAT was swift, we are waiting
for the fuel derogation in the islands. I have information that
the prices are different. Should Scotland not have the powers of an
island group of 48,000? I would have thought that the honourable
member would be pleased that we finally have a Government that is
taking forward the issue of fuel prices in remote and rural areas
and is looking to hold a pilot in constituencies such as his, as to
how exactly that would operate in practice. Again, another question
builds on the existing relationship between our countries. As I said in
response to an earlier question, China and the UK are key partners
in growth for the future. Whilst I welcome the commercial success of
the Chinese Deputy Prime Ministerier's visit to Scotland and
recognise the importance of good relations with Scotland, would my
friend agree with me that it is most important the Government
continues to press the Chinese Government on the issue of human
rights? Also, calls for a prompt release of the noble peace
Laureate? I can reassure my friend that in the course of the extensive
visit not only did we focus on our important commercial ties in
developing our partnership for growth, but we also took the
opportunity to have an on going dialogue about human rights and
other issues and we'll continue to do that. I believe we'll be
