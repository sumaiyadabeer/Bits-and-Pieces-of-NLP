These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain.
Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable
quiz team in the country.
The question is, can they be beaten?
Welcome to Eggheads, the show where a team of five quiz challengers
pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz team in Britain.
They've won some of the country's toughest quiz shows.
They are the Eggheads.
And challenging our resident champions today
are Rob DJ's Wooden Tops.
As well as hosting the quiz the rest of the team
attend in the Woodman pub in Leeds.
Team captain, Rob, is the resident quiz master
on the Chris Moyles Breakfast Show on Radio One. Let's meet them.
Hi, I'm Rob, 41, a security surveyor.
Hi, I'm Mick, I'm 49 and I'm a case worker.
Hi, I'm Debbie, I'm 44 and I'm a profit protection manager.
Hi, I'm Jim, I'm 62 and a home delivery driver.
Hi, I'm Mike, I'm 53 and a tailor.
  So, welcome Rob DJ's Wooden Tops.
  Thank you.
The Chris Moyles Breakfast Show on Radio One, I've heard of that.
You basically give him the questions you've used the night before.
Basically I email them to his producer, Rachel, and then she picks
five of the selected questions and the Chris Moyles Breakfast Show team
  take part in the quiz the next morning.
  And your voice is heard.
  I voice it yes.
  But the questions essentially you've set.
Yes, I set the questions.
And then the team do well do they, or not do well?
Not do well.
I think there's a bit of cheating takes part by Chris.
He always wins at the end of the series before he goes on holiday.
I see, I get it.
And you're all quizzers together?
And in different jobs, case worker, profit protection manager, Debbie,
what's that, store detective?
No, what I do is investigate internal and external crime in retail.
And also prevent it if we can.
My job is to prevent crime, make sure everything's fine in the stores,
and everybody's safe and secure.
And we've got a delivery driver and a tailor as well.
So, basically it's a great team.
And good luck.
Every day there's £1,000 worth of cash up for grabs
for our challengers. If they fail to defeat the Eggheads,
the prize money rolls over to the next show. You know that by now.
So, Rob DJs Wooden Tops, the Eggheads have won the last 16 games,
  which means £17,000 says you can't beat them.
  That would be nice.
It was worth turning up, wasn't it? The first head to head battle
is gonna be on the subject of music
and you can't ring Chris Moyles, I'm afraid.
Which one of you wants to take on which Egghead?
I think we'll take on Chris, please, myself against Chris.
Rob DJ from the Wooden Tops against Chris from the Eggheads.
To ensure no conferring please take your positions in the question room.
I am going to ask each of you three multiple choice questions in turn.
Whoever answers most questions wins the round.
Rob DJ, you can choose, first or second set?
I'll go first, Jeremy.
Rob, Walking Back To Happiness was a UK No. 1 hit single,
in 1961, for which singer?
It was Helen Shapiro.
Spot on and not a very easy question. Well done.
Easy to get that one wrong. What's that, 47 years ago, amazing.
Chris, your question, a famous music hall song written by Fred Gilbert
tells of the newly acquired status and manner
of the man who broke the bank, where?
He strolled along the Bois de Boulogne with an independent air
You can hear them all declare He must be a millionaire...
I broke the bank at Monte Carlo.
Yes... Great(!)
Chris is allowed one bit of karaoke in every series.
OK, here's your question, Rob DJ.
Which member of Girls Aloud was born in Northern Ireland?
Which member of Girls Aloud was born in Northern Ireland?
I think it was Nadine Coyle.
Is that your answer?
  Yes.
  It's right.
I am assuming that your surname is not DJ.
I do have a real surname.
  So, the DJ bit means you're quite good at music.
  Yes.
I would have thought so.
Chris, your question. A musical chord made up of three notes,
the root, the third and the fifth, is known as what?
Ah...
It's not a trigram because that's that Chinese thing with triangles.
And tripos is a mathematical syllabus at certain English universities.
So, it will have to be a triad.
Love the way you got there without really knowing...
and you're spot on. A triad is right.
Your question, Rob DJ.
What was the first name of the Russian composer, Stravinsky?
This is a bit old for me.
I think just based on the pronunciation I'm gonna go for Igor.
Based on the pronunciation of what?
Igor being a Russian sounding name?
It was Igor Stravinsky, you're quite right.
Chris Moyles is cheering out there.
It would be very embarrassing, this.
I actually have a striking resemblance to Igor Stravinsky.
  In later life.
  Yeah, I've seen some photographs.
He looks identical to me.
Which of your hairstyles was he using?
  He had it very slicked back.
  Your Stravinsky as it's known.
Not like this.
Chris, your question.
The UK singles Child and Clementine and the album Green Man
were solo projects by which member of Take That?
Hmm.
Get this wrong, you've gone.
Now, the only name I recognise there is Jason Orange.
I don't think Mark Owen or Howard Donald went in for solo projects,
but I've an idea Jason Orange did try to strike out on his own, briefly,
with a couple of projects. So, I will go for Jason Orange.
  OK, Rob DJ, do you know the answer to that?
  It's Mark Owen.
Yeah, it is Mark Owen. So, Chris you're wrong.
You can clap him being wrong.
It's OK. It's not unsporting. So, Rob DJ, well done.
You really took him apart on music
as expected for a DJ, I guess. But more pressure for you.
It'd have been embarrassing if I hadn't won.
Exactly. You're in the final round, Chris isn't.
Do both of you rejoin us here in the studio.
So far, the challengers have lost no brains from the final round,
the Eggheads have lost one brain,
and we've also learnt that CJ looks like Stravinsky.
The next subject is film and television.
Which of you challengers wants film and TV?
It's going to be me, Jeremy, and I'm going to take Kevin on.
Debbie, Kevin. OK, Debbie from the Wooden Tops,
and Kevin from the Eggheads, on Film and TV.
And to ensure there's no conferring please take your positions.
Three questions. Film and TV, the subject.
  Debbie you can say first or second set.
  I'll go first, please.
And good luck to you. The nose of which character
in a Disney animation, grows longer whenever he tells a lie?
Rob DJ has got a bit of a nose, so I think it's Pinocchio.
  Absolutely right, well done.
  Thank you.
Kevin, the twins Christina and Caroline Alessi and Mrs Mangel
were characters in which TV soap?
Well, I've vaguely heard of the Alessis, and I think Mrs Mangel
was one of those famous characters from Neighbours.
Neighbours is right, Kevin, well done.
Over to you, Debbie. Fred Scuttle
was a regular character on which comedian's TV shows?
I'm thinking not Benny Hill.
For some strange reason, don't ask me why, I'm not thinking that.
I'm going to have a guess because I don't really know.
It's between two of them. I'm gonna go for Spike Milligan.
Rob DJ's Wooden Tops?
  Benny Hill.
  Benny Hill, yeah, was the answer.
The first one I knocked back as well.
  Beret and thick round glasses.
  Yeah.
  That was him, that was Fred Scuttle.
Kevin, over to you, the Fred Scuttle of Eggheads.
Which comedienne starred alongside Woody Allen in his 2000 film comedy
Small Time Crooks?
I was trying to remember if she actually played his wife in the film,
I think she did, actually.
It's Tracey Ullman.
Yes, it is Tracey Ullman, well done.
All right, two points to the Eggheads, one to the challenger.
You need to get this one right, Debbie, or he's knocked you out
and you're not in the final round.
The Indian Runner was the directorial debut of which actor?
I am going to go, I have no idea why I'm going to go for it,
probably cos its my mother's favourite actor.
I will go for Robert Redford.
Wrong generation. It was Sean Penn, which means, Kevin, well done.
Debbie you were beaten by our Eggheads.
Sadly, you can't play in the final round.
Kevin you will and you can.
Please both of you come back and join your team mates.
As it stands the challengers have lost one brain from the final round
and the Eggheads have lost one brain.
The next subject is sport, I reckon you've got a sports person there.
Who wants to play sport?
  OK, I'll go.
  Jim?
  Jim.
Jim, our home delivery driver.
  CJ. Yes.
  CJ. Jim against CJ.
Jim, from Rob DJs Wooden Tops, against CJ, from the Eggheads.
To make sure there is no conferring please go to the question room.
I'm going to ask each of you three questions on sport,
  so Jim would you like the first or second set of questions?
  First.
In horse racing, the Thursday in Royal Ascot week
is commonly known as what?
I think its Ladies' Day.
You're right, it's Ladies' Day.
Rory McIlroy, born in Northern Ireland in 1989 is a rising star
in which sport?
This is one of those, I could have used process of elimination
cos I know it's not tennis, I know it's not snooker
but I happen to know he's a golfer anyway. So, it's golf.
Golf is correct.
Back to you, Jim. Here's your next question.
How high is the springboard in an Olympic diving competition?
A pure guess, is this.
I'll go 3m.
That's a very good guess, you're absolutely right.
  I would have just guessed five.
  We were thinking of the high board ten.
Three metres is nine feet, it doesn't sound high enough.
  No, it doesn't, well done.
  Well done, Jim, inspired.
CJ, short stop is a position in which sport?
None of those sports I know very much about.
Why I'm referring to just those three sports...
I know nothing about very many sports, but American especially,
but I think short stop's in baseball.
And where do you think short stop is?
  No point in asking me that.
  The guy who hands out the ice creams.
If that's where you want it to be, that's fine by me.
Baseball is right.
You knew enough to get the points.
OK, Jim, put him under pressure, get this one right.
In 2004 Danny Cipriano made his debut at the age of just 17,
for which rugby union team?
Rugby union is not really my forte.
I'm going to go for Harlequins.
  Eggheads, you know which one?
  Wasps.
It is Wasps.
CJ, you get this right you have taken the round.
Who was in goal for England when Diego Maradona scored
his infamous "hand of God" goal?
That was in 1986, wasn't it?
I thought that was still in Shilton's era.
I thought Shilton went up until 1991.
I can't go for anybody else. I'll have to go for Peter Shilton.
Jim, you look downcast.
Yes, it is the right answer.
It takes the other contestant to tell you. CJ, you are right.
It is Peter Shilton.
So, that means you, CJ, will play in the final round.
Jim, I'm sorry you can't.
Please, both of you come back to us.
So, the challengers have lost two brains from the final round,
the Eggheads have lost only one brain.
The last subject is Food and Drink.
Normally, people choose Kevin, cos he has problems with it,
but he's been done.
It's going to have to be me, the worst possible subject for me.
What? Drink isn't.
I don't mind the drink...
The food side might be a problem.
OK, Mick against whom?
We'll try Barry.
Nick from Rob DJ's Wooden Tops against Barry from the Eggheads.
To ensure no conferring, please take your positions in the question room.
So, Mick, I gather you are a local celebrity.
I like to think so, yeah.
Tell us why.
I have sung on Radio One,
because they needed a lousy pub singer
when doing a live broadcast. And I was honoured to be given the job.
  What did you sing?
  It was a Christmas medley.
  The Pogues, Cliff Richard and John Lennon.
  Great, one into the other?
All in one medley.
How fantastic. It went down well?
Yeah, it did. It achieved exactly what they wanted,
sound like a lousy pub singer at a proper pub.
You were also on Jools Holland's show but answering questions?
I was but there was a huge tragedy in that my buzzer wasn't working.
Honest, it wasn't.
So it looked like you weren't coming up with any answers?
No, that's right, yeah, yeah.
I haven't actually got that excuse this time though, have I?
There's no buzzer. You can wave. Anything goes wrong just wave.
If we have a complete technical meltdown Barry's glasses go dark,
that's what happens.
  OK, so are you ready?
  I am.
Would you like the first or second set of questions.
I'll have the first set of questions, please.
I was gonna ask, want the food or drink questions?
But it doesn't work like that.
With what is the liqueur, creme de menthe, flavoured?
Well, I haven't got a clue.
I wouldn't have thought... Oh, there's that sweet mincemeat...?
I am going to guess at marzipan.
Your team have just collapsed.
It's mint.
Aargh!
We've gotta hope now, that Barry is in catastrophic form.
Barry, crispy seaweed and prawn toasts
are items frequently found on menus in the UK.
For which type of food?
Well, I'm a great fan of Asian cooking
and crispy seaweed is in the Chinese cuisine.
That's right, classic Chinese takeaway order.
In a cafe in Italy, if you want an iced coffee what should you ask for?
I would probably eliminate caffe frutto because I would assume
there's some connection with a fruit flavour in the coffee.
So is it the fristo or freddo...?
I guess at cafe freddo.
  Good, you got it right, well done.
  Yes!
Burst into a moment's song for us?
If you want.
  No, please no.
  Quickly.
  The hills are alive!
That's enough. Thank you.
Barry, your next question.
Which term means to pour fat or juices over roast meat,
during cooking, to keep it moist?
Well, I do a lot of cooking in my house and I enjoy it very much.
And to pour roast fat over food is basting.
It is basting, well done.
So you need this question now,
Mick, or you're going to go down the Swanee.
Here it is. Eau de vie,
is a French term for a variety of which spirit?
Eau de vie.
I'll spell it for you. E A U, hyphen, D E, hyphen, V I E.
Vie, life.
The word "vie" in French, is life, I think.
That doesn't really help me very much here.
I view gin as a UK English drink.
I would have to guess at brandy
because it is a French drink.
It's funny... That's your answer, you came out with a series of words
that were completely unrelated to each other,
and which I couldn't determine any meaning at all from,
then suddenly you say brandy and you're quite right.
Ooh!
Oh, please stay in the contest, it would be entertaining.
You've got every chance of that.
Moving from local to national celebrity even as we speak.
Barry, you can make it curtains for Mick if you get this right.
Which celebrity chef opened a restaurant called Plain Food
at Heathrow's Terminal 5 in March 2008?
Gosh, don't know this one.
I know Gordon Ramsay is opening restaurants all over the place,
but somehow I don't think it was him.
Heathrow, Terminal 5.
Somehow, that doesn't seem to be the sort of place Heston Blumenthal
would want to open a restaurant, so I shall go for Jamie Oliver.
I was there the other day funnily enough, and I saw this place,
and I noticed it was Gordon Ramsay who'd opened it. So, you're wrong.
Well done, Mick, you came through the accident with creme de menthe,
spilling that, and we go now to sudden death.
These questions are that bit harder, they are not multiple choice.
Here's yours. Which red syrup is added to tequila and orange juice
to make a tequila sunrise cocktail.
Red syrup.
Something come.
Raspberry juice.
Raspberry juice, it's grenadine, is the answer.
Never heard of it, so...
OK, your question, Barry.
If you get this right you are in the final and Mick is not.
Which salad traditionally contains anchovies and hard boiled eggs
and takes its name from a city in the south of France?
This is one of my favourite salads.
It comes from the town of Nice and it's salad nicoise.
Salad nicoise.
Well done, you're right.
So, Barry, you're in the final I'm sorry to say, Mick, you're not,
disappointing for all of us.
Please, both of you, come back to your teams.
  So, the Wooden Tops have been a little bit depleted, Rob.
  Mmm.
  Just a touch.
  Yeah.
We only got rid of one of the Eggheads too, it's a bit worrying.
It's a bit worrying!
What does Alex Ferguson call it?
You're all right asking someone who's a Leeds United fan that, aren't you?
Squeaky bum time.
This is what we have been playing towards. Time for the final round,
which is General Knowledge. I am afraid though,
those of you who lost your head to heads,
won't be taking part in this round.
So, that's Mick and Debbie and Jim,
from Rob DJ's Wooden Tops and Chris from the Eggheads.
Please leave the studio.
So, £17,000, we're playing for.
  Bit of a tall order.
  We've done nearly 500 programmes,
and it's only gone above 20,000 eight times.
So, the air's getting a little bit rarefied here.
The highest I've ever seen one is 16.
So, basically we are due for a win.
Oh, good, that'll be nice.
Rob and Mike, you are playing to win Rob DJ's Wooden Tops £17,000.
Just to make it formal, Kevin, CJ, Daphne and Barry,
you're playing for something else, for the Eggheads' reputation.
As usual, I will ask each team three questions in turn,
the questions are all general knowledge.
You are allowed to confer in this round.
Rob DJ's Wooden Tops, the question is,
are your two brains better than the Eggheads' four?
Rob and Mike, first or second?
We'll go first, please.
Here's your question, good luck.
The American, George Horace Gallup, was an early and successful exponent
of what activity?
  Definitely.
  Opinion polling.
  That's your answer.
  Yeah.
  Correct.
Eggheads, in law, what term refers to a document in writing,
signed and delivered transferring a right over property?
That would be a deed.
Deed is the correct answer, Daphne, well done.
Rob DJ's Wooden tops,
In British politics, the chairman of ways and means
is the official title of which person?
Ways and means, I'm thinking money. Taxes... Chancellor?
It certainly won't be Prime Minister, so, I would say chancellor.
  I mean, would you agree?
  I don't know. We'll go for chancellor.
We'll go for chancellor.
  Eggheads, have they got it right?
  Deputy speaker.
Deputy speaker is the answer, one of those funny titles,
what the heck does it mean?
Next question is for the Eggheads.
Eggheads, the sign for pound sterling
is derived from which letter of the alphabet?
That'd be L for Libra.
That's L for Libra.
Why would it be L for Libra?
Because that's the Roman word for pound.
It's the correct answer.
Eggheads, well done.
Ooh, that 17,000 is looking shaky. You must get this question right.
Here's your question.
Mistress Overdone, Escalus and Lord Angelo are characters
in which Shakespeare play?
  Measure For Measure.
  That's a bit apt isn't it, being a tailor.
Measure For Measure.
You're right.
Eggheads, if you get this right,
you've won the contest and you've taken the £17,000 away from them.
Lake Hauroko, situated in Fiordland National Park,
is the deepest lake in which country?
  Fiordland is in New Zealand.
  Let's just get the spelling first.
  It's got to be Fiordland but...
  OK, fair enough.
  Just to be double sure.
  Shall I spell the lake for you?
  Yeah.
The Fiordland National Park is in New Zealand.
So, that's the answer.
If you get this, you've won the contest and taken the money
away from our brave contestants.
Eggheads, it's right. New Zealand, congratulations you've won.
Commiserations, challengers, you ran them close.
The Eggheads have done what comes naturally.
Their winning streak continues.
I'm afraid you won't be going home with the £17,000,
which means the money rolls over to the next show.
  It's been very nice to have you.
  Nice to be here.
  Our regards to Mr Moyles.
  Certainly.
He does a great show. Eggheads, congratulations.
Who will beat you? Join us next time to see if the new challengers
have the brains to defeat the Eggheads.
£18,000 says they don't.
