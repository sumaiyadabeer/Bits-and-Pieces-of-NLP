the East Midlands. We are here to reflect on the Lucerne regatta, the
final event of the World Cup calendar and the warm up before the
championships. The Great Britain team did not go to Hamburg because
of the E coli scare, meaning the Henley Regatta was even more
significant stop    even more significant than normal.
The most significant result from The most significant result from
Hamburg was the return to winning ways of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond
of New Zealand. The Kiwi duo of New Zealand. The Kiwi duo
strolled to victory and their first medal of the season. We were here
to win, we want to raise the bar a bit in the pairs. We will see what
happens when we meet the rest of the field in Lucerne.
Also an action was a Kiwi singles sculler. I really feel confident
now that I can get out and do it and hopefully go the same in
Lucerne. In the absence of Great Britain,
most of the regatta was about New Zealand.
With hamburger out, the women's team had an unscheduled but
trophies are plenty and records tumbling. We are reminded the
growing world we are a force to be reckoned with. The men's doubles
champions. To dominate how we have, break records left, right and
centre. The men's eight and narrowly lost out to their German
counterparts. After an early lead they will want a number of times
for crossing the path of the GB boat, and this near collision seems
to have further ignited rivalry. Going into a son, we need to do
something about this.    going into a son. Andy Hodge and Pete Reed
Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent. Pleased we did well, we came out
with a top performance and we are really, really keen going forward.
The Men's Four were on fire, knocking three seconds off the
course record on their way to beat the Americans. It is not always
that you get a win here, never mind beating the record.
A men's squad beat the world champions Croatia in their final   
of the men's quad. The Women's Eight ran America close, forcing
them to another course record to win the trophy. The sparring is
over, now it is time for the countdown to the World Championship
to begin. The men's pair have begun with two
victories, but now their biggest test as New Zealand awaits them in
Lucerne. Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins, she has been in the
power and the quad, but is this the combination that can bring the
elusive gold in London? Tom James made a goal to return to
the Men's Four after two years away.    a golden return. And are the
men's eight sake of the site of silver?
   sake of the site? Here we are with Steve Redgrave by
the riverbank, I don't think we have ever done this with a local
regatta in the background before. What is your take in the interest
and participation levels? It is a great sport, the problem we have is
space to get boats into boat houses. Juniors and veterans rowing is a
big expansion. At grass roots, it is very healthy. Do we need more
water? More water, better quality water, better quality rowing clubs.
But it is still in pretty good shape. It seems vibrant here at
Burton. But let's go to Lucerne. The big question rowing fans were
asking his after 12 significant    consecutive defeat to New Zealand,
could the British pair prove they for. New Zealand are out quick,
looking to continue their impressive run of 12 consecutive
wins. New Zealand are the world champions, powering through the
Zealand for the last two years. New Zealander Aaron Lane four, Canada
in five, Hungary in lane number 6. The early leaders are in lane
number one, the Italians. I am the Canadians are very fast.    and the
Canadians are very fast. All four Andy Hodge, they just believe they
can beat New Zealand. That is why they have been given another run
through this year to take them on. Canada are closest to us. About six
or seven feet over Italy in lane do if they are to get back into the
race, into the second 500. If you get a great start in the first five,
it gives you the confidence to step down into your rhythm. You have to
work up to get the speed. This is the psychological difference as New
Zealand start to pay their way through. New Zealand did that for
about 20 seconds. They have such flexibility, they saw there was a
danger from Canada. They just pushed on, look at that. They have
gone right the way through and have taken the lead from Italy at the
top of the picture. Italy were at Henley last week. Britain beat
Italy at Henley. But Great Britain are sitting back in the field.
hard to see what they will do as they come towards halfway. This is
all about making a big, big statement. Eric Murray and Hamish
Bond are laying it down. Great Britain have to do a lot to
have thought coming through the 1,000 metre mark in the men's
heavyweight coxless pairs that New Zealand would have walked away from
Great Britain, who are now languishing right back in 5th
position? They are struggling to find any kind of speed or rhythm
that will put them on a pace with the cruise around them, much less
the New Zealand crew, who were just enjoying this. Eric Murray on your
right. They are a street ahead of everybody. They have cut through
the field, look how far they are against Great Britain, no coming
back. They thought they had improved and moved on, but the flow
and the ease of stroke from New Zealand, last still moving away, it
just crap    cut right the way from Canada. Five legs ahead of Great
Britain. It was a high rating, but they flowed easily and let their
boat run. They have more flexibility, they can turn it on if
they need to. Peter Reed and Andy Hodge sat down after the World
Championships last year, they came closest by a couple of feet to New
Zealand, and they said, we really believe another season and we will
catch them. Jurgen Grobler will be watching this from the side, he
will have to really be recalculating his ambitions going
forward for this grid.    for the screw. Will he stay together with
his combination? Who knows? It is the last 500 metres of the men's
heavyweight coxless pairs, New Zealand are strolling away. They
have the grip of this race in the first three or four strokes, got
out quickly, got into a rhythm, and Great Britain really struggled in
lane number 34 stop we thought New Zealand would win but we did not
think it would be by the impressive lead they have established. They
are enjoying this, they are enjoying the crowd as they come
towards the last 250 metres. strokes a minute, they are on   
they are unstoppable. They will be thinking should we try to bury the
competition from Great Britain right now and see how much we can
beat them by, or should we tantalise them and try to stay
closer? This is domination. Peter Reed and Andy Hodge, they are
racing for the silver medal against a very impressive Canadian crew.
The last time this Canadian crew got together they won the silver
medal in Beijing at the Olympics. This is the quality in this field.
The Canadians are shoring up slightly. Surely they can't hold
Great Britain, the current world silver medallists? They are looking
long and impressive. They continued to dominate this event, to dominate
Great Britain. 13 wins in a row from New Zealand over Great Britain
who are, it has to be said, limping over the line into the silver
position, and Canada get the bronze. Pretty conclusive. That is the
first meeting they have had this year, New Zealand and Great Britain.
New Zealand look unstoppable. Unlucky for some, 13, 13 in a row
for New Zealand, which has become their lucky number. Look at the
distance, almost seven seconds into distance, almost seven seconds into
silver, over Canada in bronze medal position.
You were pretty pumped before the race and lots of your fans in
Britain were thinking this could be the time after the magic row in the
world championships? We had a great preparation, a great Henley on 
Thames, we came here with all guns blazing, it felt, but it turned
into our normal Lucerne performance, which was disappointing. But I am
confident we can build up the speed and get them like we did last year.
We came short by a few hundredths, but give us a month and a half and
we can do a lot of damage. I have to ask this tough question, isn't
it about time you went back in the four, you stop the losing streak?
tough question, one we are always asked. At the moment we are really
happy raising the power, it is a simple boat. Nobody likes
collecting silver, but we feel it is good for our rowing at the
moment. If we stay in the pair, we will aim to get our noses in front,
but if we get a silver, we still think what we are learning will pay
off. I feel we can really add to the boats if we go into the four.
It is dominant, we will make it faster. At least we will have had
this year and the last few years behind us to move the rowing on.
A pretty resounding resort for New Zealand, so where does that leave
Pete Reed and Andy Hodge? By themselves or relocated to the
coxless four, which won gold in Beijing? There's a feeling you have
to do international sport over and over and over again without ever
taking time off. But some people think if you leave for a while it
reignite enthusiasm, and Tom James, one of the victorious quartet in
China, fit that category. Tom James exudes conference   
confidence. It comes with being an Olympic champion. The British are
now out, they will be the Olympic champions! Gold medal, Great
Britain, wonderfully done! What a perfect, perfect day!
After his Men's Four gold in Beijing, James has been out of
sight on the British rowing scene. I have had de Quiros, been
travelling, did the gap year thing which I missed out on when I was 18.
   I have had a year off. I did some skiing and put on weight. I
did some work experience, planning for when I eventually finished
rolling. I came back into it at the end of 2009. I got injured, I
thought it was a normal back strain but it turned into a pretty bad
back injury. Things escalated, and when you get into that situation,
your heart stops. Out of sight means out of mind, generally, but
that does not apply to James. Despite the injuries, he has been
confident enough to fit back in. have a gold medal under my belt,
which gives you a certain confidence. Not complacency, but
you know you have been there, done that and you are a top athlete.
There is a certain expectation about winning races. Things have
stepped up since Beijing. The team has really grown, there is a lot of
camaraderie, a lot of banter. quartet needed reinvigorating.
Failure to win gold in another championship meant it was back to
the drawing board over the winter, and to good effect. A gold medal,
back on top of the podium, the men's heavyweight coxless four.
have shown we are pretty quick already. It is early days, we want
to build. The most important thing, we have the same attitude to racing.
We don't want to be too prescriptive, we like being free in
our racing, turning up and being quite reactive and being able to
race, not having too much of a race plan. Timing is everything in sport.
Tom has chosen his comeback wisely. At stake, a place for 2012. As a
late place for Beijing, James knows nobody in his game is guaranteed.
Winning in Beijing came very quickly, I was not in the squad the
year before. That year was fantastic, selection went really
well, by the end of it I got a gold medal. I was left thinking, what do
I do now? I am 24 with a gold medal, I can do a lot of things. But then
you have London looming over you, it will be one of the best games
Tom James obviously a key component of the coxless four, so let's see
Germany on the outside. United States of America in one, Greece in
two, and we're watching the German crew here. The World Cup leaders
with the yellow Jersey is under their racing tops. Challenging
alongside the British crew there. The Greeks will be quick and the
first 500 metres. Germany, interestingly have been swapping
between the eight and the four, to try to find the best combinations.
They have not been beaten in twenty five races, the eights. But
the four have been juggled around, to get the best combination. So we
will see how this four shapes up. They are beginning to edge away,
with a quarter length lead on the field. Looking very calm. The boat
travels between strokes very nicely. And the coach for the British fours,
John West. Very calm and experienced coach. Working well
with this combination. And we have Tom James back, it really has
worked well. Tom James, Olympic champion, 2,000 and Date, he took
one year off in 2009, he was injured in 2010. And the British
crew now can just enjoy this second 500, just laying down the race plan.
What Tom James does when he gets into the boat, he allows the others
to relax. He is so flexible. He is not big, he just gets sucked into
that bolt, and allows the big guys to have a little more time to roll.
So they just long.    they just below along. He started his
international career at the Olympics when he was 19 years old.
Just taking a length. Just moving steadily ahead. And very good form.
Coming up to the halfway mark and that teams will receive
encouragement, shouting, from their team mates. Going through 1,000
metres, 1,000 metres gone, and what a position for the British crew.
The British have to lay down a bigger benchmark because there is
so much going on. This year, or next year, when we have a pair that
might want to go into this, Andy Hodge and Pete Reed, because there
pair is not going as well as the magnate like it to.    as they make
and Reid, with that upset the balance? Just strengthening that
eight with two goes out of that board, that would strengthen the
eight and produce the chances. That would be the perfect strategy
through the winter if they could work that out. But Britain is just
winning at the front of this all the time and it is quite remarkable.
It is to do with money because �24 million and very good organisation
has gone into the British team. It just shows that that kind of
investment really pays off. British crew, now, ahead, into the
last quarter of this race. Not seeing too much from them, just
containing their position. Holding of Greece, end only number of two.
   in lane number two. The US are fantastically fast finishers, lying
in 5th position in the qualifiers, and came right through to qualifier.
The best four athletes in the American squad and that they hoped
to challenge at the top level. They are not going to catch Britain, who
are just so strong. Alex Gregory in the stroke seat from Reading
University Boat Club. Just coming up towards the finishing line. A
little over 200m remaining. They can enjoy this. Looking back and
seeing the world coming at them but under no pressure whatsoever. 100,
a little over, Great Britain's safely in the gold medal position.
So much going on with this four, in the light of other things going on
in the men's events, the men's teams, but they can enjoy the
moment, they are gold medallists today, and by some distance. These
second and just on the line, the United States of America take the
bronze. Great Britain get the gold medal from Greece and the United
States. The British are just getting better and better. Turning
around that 4th place at the World around that 4th place at the World
Championship last year. How exciting was that? You destroyed
the field. It was nice to see, from my seat, everyone going backwards.
Nice not to have to sprint for the line, and watching everyone else
printing or second or third, it is nice to dominate the race. We have
a long period from now until the World Championships and we have to
enjoy these moments, because this is what we do it for. I really
enjoyed it. What are you Michael Thaw's, on the Men's Pair results,
and the difference between the Kiwis and the British pair? It was
a big margin, but Pete and Andy have tried hard and credit to them.
It is the event. We're here to make our four will quickly and Andy and
Pete Artemis and we will support them Foster in any event, we want
to see them win. But we are talking about the coxless fours here, so...
The coxless fours in Mike impious form. And Andy Reed    and Pete
Reed and Andy Hodge Peat Inn resoundingly. So what is going on?
No one can answer that better than Pete Reid and Andy Hodge themselves.
Pete said that this might be our last time racing in the pairs, so
they might knew that the pressure was on after their performance last
year. It is always very difficult coming out of Henley, racing. They
found themselves at the top of the pack behind. In previous races it
has been the Kiwis, the Brits, and then the pack behind. You do not
change a winning team, so why change the four when they are
looking so good? I don't think you can change the four at the moment.
I cannot see Jurgen Grobler changing anything. I think he will
see this season out. It is a matter of less than two months to the
world championships. I think he will stick with what he has got now.
But there will be changes for next year, through the winter. If the
four goes on and wins everything, is there an option to put Pete Reed
and Andy Hodge into a eight, to give them a substantial chance of
winning the gold medal there? Putting the two best guys in the
British team will make the eight go faster, but will it be fast enough
to win on last year's will John Major performance? Yes. On this
year's performance, probably not.     last year's world championship
performance. But that is about pique and Andy who are the stars
and the British team and are not winning, but the four is. Is it a
man management issue? How do you say to somebody, I don't think you
are going to win a gold medal in that boat, so I am seeking you out
of their and putting you somewhere else. If the two individuals want
to carry on in the pairs, there is no reason why they cannot overturn
13 defeats. But you only need to win one or, as long as it is the
right one. You only get one chance at the Olympics, once every four
years. Whoever his bid is going into it, there is a lot of pressure
on that.    whoever his favourite going into it. It is a difficult
process. The underlying factor is British rowing wants to have gold
medals and even though it is fantastic having a silver medal and
it is good for the credibility of rowing in at the UK, we want our
best people winning gold medals. That is going to continue in the
weeks and months ahead. We had been talking about 2012. The rowing
story of the Year centres on Katherine Grainger. The
unforgettable images of the Sydney Olympics. Great Britain gets the
gold medal! Steve Redgrave, five in a row! What a great Olympian.
the undercard was a rowing silver poorer women squat who has gone on
to become great Britain's best ever female raw. It is called for
Germany, and on the line they are pushing on! It is going to be a
photo finish. In gold police Mac, Germany, and Silver Place, Britain,
we got it! Katherine Grainger turning silver into gold. Romania
defended the Olympic gold medal, they did it again, and Great
Britain put everything into the melting pot and take the silver

make a dull time lucky for the indomitable Scot. It will be
another silver for Great Britain. They 1 three silver medals at

a fabulous result for Katherine Grainger, the silver medal. But she
has always really wanted to be part of a team. For me, rowing is about
being in might accrue.    in and crew. It is about trying to put
everything into place to get a result. But it is about every
element of that team feeling that it is the right thing to do, and
this build Wright, from the of bus  stop it was early 2010 and we went
out to a training camp in Portugal. We thought, I am just doing my
thing, and Caton is doing her thing, but it was actually together. I
made a few calls, and she changed in exactly the way that I meant it
without me having to explain it in much details, and knowing how
strong the board are physically, I knew that if we had this technical
synergy, then it could be really special. It build good and it was
good. The 2010 campaign ended in world championship glory. Look at
this she a determination from Katherine Grainger in the stroke
seat. What a combination. They are just stretched out now, having
annihilated the field. Impressive from the first to the last. Great
Britain are the new world champions in the women's double sculls.
Katherine Grainger is used to being the number one performer in winter
training. But this time around, Anna Watkins beat her in the trials.
The clock Willie is ticking. knows what next year is about.   
really is ticking. It is in the here and now that she was second to
Anna Watkins in the singles and I'm sure that she was to come first
next year. So in the double the will have new challenge is, and new
crews to make, there. The sense of urgency and getting things right
probably builds as you go on. Katherine Grainger has had enough
of being second and it is likely that London will be our last chance
of standing on the podium, and she wants it badly, but so does her
crew made, so the knack have the air of a winning combination.
all know what Katharine is capable of. But I want it for myself.
Nobody or in the winning team    women's team has ever won a gold
medal. This crew is special and it deserves to get special resource.
We are very much on the countdown to 2012 now. But we cannot last for
up to that point. It is all about taking steps on the way they are.
In some ways it deals round the corner, in other ways, there is a
lot to be done. Sport matters to me a great deal. I still celebrate the
highs as much as I have ever suffered the laws, but you can
also... I cannot see what shape it is going to take. I do not know
what is coming. I can see that it Katherine Grainger's dedication and
commitment is total, but it is longevity, a decade plus of
maintaining that enthusiasm, that is what sets some athletes apart
from others? Definitely. And within women's rowing it is more unusual
than men's, but it is still unusual within men's rowing, to row for
such a long period. Three silver medals, two of them outstanding
performances, the last one was a bit disappointing. The combination
with Anna works really well, there is a lot of competition between
them when they are training and Anna has beaten her up a couple of
times that trials, which pushes you on a little bit and shows you how
close they are in performance, and that closeness is really pushing
through on the overall performance. Anna has had trouble with a back
injury in the last few months, they are not in the best possible shape.
the Women's Double Sculls, Anna Watkins and Katherine Grainger from
Watkins and Katherine Grainger from Great Britain are showing things
are again looking to be almost back to normal. They are almost a length
ahead, their first real, proper ahead, their first real, proper
test in the 2011 season, and they must be very happy. At Munich, Anna
was injured and Katherine Grainger teamed up with the spare, they won
pretty convincingly. This is getting Anna back, taking it
gradually, not wanting to put any big riskiness. They are working
well together. Pressure is coming from the Australians. They are just
hanging on. Perhaps they are going slightly quicker. This is a repeat
of the World Championship final last year. Last year in the World
Championship, but a ball so well comfortable, but now they are
having to fight more, finding their way again    the doubles were
comfortable. It was looking a bit Labour and and heavy before as the
Australian's challenge, they were gearing up to make a move. They
went up to 36 strokes a minute, they have held off the Australian
challenge. The Australians are up to 38 strokes a minute, reckoning
they have a good chance of matching them. Ready to exploit Anna's
hesitancy about her back. This is the time they really want to try to
cause some psychological damage. They are pushing hard and it is
still coming back. Into the last 500 metres we will see a great race.
The Australians are in second, Great Britain in first, first and
second from the world championships last year. Everybody else is racing
for the Brahms. Great Britain are holding a game. Look at the lens of
stroke from the British crew, Grainger, from St Andrew boat club,
Anna Watkins from Leander Club. They are thinking about being long
and relaxed. They were caught a bit by the
Australian challenge. They want to keep control and not have to sprint.
But it got heavy dealing that. It looks much easier now, much
livelier. They are moving away from Australia. They wanted to put
pressure on Watkins' back, to see if they could break her down before
the World Championships, but she looks very strong. The boat looks
much livelier as they come into the last 250 metres. The British crew
moving to a length over the world silver medallists Australia. Just
looking at Ukraine in lane number 54 stop    lane number 5. Now some
clear water from Great Britain. They can enjoy the last bit after
doing all that was asked of them. In the last 500 they held off a
sustained attack from the Australians. It is a solid back
from Anna Watkins. They have got inside, five strokes, they can
count them in, it is a job well done. When they look back at the
gold medal they have won, you can see this was perhaps a very
significant win over Australia. Australia close in a little bit
again. They were able to maintain 36 or 37 strokes a minute ride the
way through. Great Britain first of Australia and Ukraine, a very
Australia and Ukraine, a very important win.    first, although
Australia and Ukraine. Anna, it looked like a tough race
for your comeback international of the season? It was tough,
psychologically and tactically more than physically, probably, because
we have not had the preparation or got the confidence back that we
usually have. It was a really good race to be in the fight, we have
not had that in the doubles before, we are confident we can step up
from here. Last year with the World Championship, everyone had you down
as Britain's top crew to win gold. The field looks like it is closing
now? When we decided to come here, Anna was not backed a full racing
fitness and we had to hedge our bets whether it was worth coming,
we decided we wanted to get some tough racing under our belts. The
fact we are still ahead of the field without much preparation
together is looking quite good. Another victory, perhaps closer
than you might have thought, how much of that was down to Anna
missing so much training? I think time in the boat has been missed,
she has been training throughout but it is never quite the same
intensity if you are doing rehab training than actually being in the
boat. But I was really quite pleased with how they performed
when put under pressure. In the past, that is one that has been an
issue of crews putting pressure at major championships and faltering.
Knowing the preparation has not been brilliant, that will set them
in a really good stead for future pressure races, and there will be a
few of them. Hovering in the background is the thought, do they
double up and try to win two gold medals? They are very keen to be
able to do that. You could look at it either way, should they
concentrate on the one they are doing? They have done that before
and it has not worked at the Olympics. By doing two events, does
that break the pressure and give you more time to think about the
issues you have than the issues which have arisen from what has
happened in the past? What about someone like Kelly Holmes, winning
the 1500? It is like one is a backstop, but the backstop can end
up being your strongest event? Exactly. There are so many
different ways you can look at it. If you double up and it is
successful, you have made the right decision. If you double up and you
are not successful, either of them, at the level you want to be, it
becomes a bigger issue. Then you will be slated for doing that. Some
very big decisions to be made in the next couple of months.
We started the programme by talking about Great Britain and New Zealand,
and their rivalry, here is another pair gets away, really looking at
the centre, lane three, Great Britain, silver medallists at the
World Championships. Elaine four, New Zealand, the world champions.
Great Britain are going OPs move and relaxed, Heather Stanning in
the stroke seat closest to worse, from the army Rowing Club. She is
relaxed through 100 metres.    in the stroke seat closest to us.
looked for a long and effective. They are settling down now, they
have picked it up at a higher rate, settling down into their race pace.
Moving very well in lane three, Great Britain. The British crew
have got almost clear water, and going away from the All Blacks tour
of New Zealand in lane number four.    going away from the all black
strip of New Zealand. They have really opened it up. Quite a
dangerous tactic from what is, experienced wise, a young pair.
They are so much. They have lovely legs, very relaxed, doing nothing
wrong, no complicated movements. They have settled into a nice race
pace, 34 strokes a minute. Now they just have to hold a very, very
strong middle of the race pace. big surprise in the opening quarter
of this final of the women's pair is that New Zealand's, the world
champions, they are going through in 4th place    New Zealand, the
world champions. We are now approaching the three 
quarter way mark, look at the space between the British crew in lane
number 3 and, slowly but surely, New Zealand coming through the pack.
They have taken over the USA in a number one. Do they have the
experience as we go into the 4th quarter? This is where the
experience, wisdom and everything players in. Have the British got
the cushion to hold on to the New the cushion to hold on to the New
Zealanders, who are coming up in the overlap? New Zealand are
experienced, they are at 37 strokes a minute, you would expect the
British to react. New Zealand hunting them down, there is an
overlap. They have been a 37 strokes a minute for about three
minutes. Through 300 metres from a line, one thing is for sure, New
Zealand, the world champions, are hunting the British pair down. They
were caught napping in the first 500 metres, they were dumped off
the start and they have to work hard in the second 1000. New
Zealand are coming up again, they are about a third of a length off.
Still they are fighting to the line. The British pair have to respond.
The British crew have to go up, the world champions are coming through.
Great Britain is still there, but at the lower rate of 34 strokes per
minute. Now they are trying to respond. But watch New Zealand, the
fight is on for the last 200 metres. Inside the last 10 strokes, it will
be a race for the line. Great Britain are hanging on by about
three or four feet, we are up to the line and the British crew have
held off an incredible charge from New Zealand as they come through.
New Zealand's heads are down, they realise they got the first 1000
wrong. It will be an incredible race when they come Back Again at
the World Championship. Great Britain imperious in the first 1000,
under pressure in the second. Top of the tree over New Zealand, last
How did that feel, to beat the world champions in Lucerne?
really good feeling. We are really pleased with our performance, it is
the first time we have raised, we were coming here to beat them and
to win. It put us on a really good progression towards Bled, but at
the same time it was a really close race, so we know it is not always
done, give us six more weeks of hard training. Helen, looking at
your improvement curve, it is forever going upwards at an amazing
rate. It has been such a whirlwind 12 months, what is it like to look
back as the Lucerne winners? little bit surreal. I feel like I
really want to keep hold of this momentum, we are still improving,
and the longer we can hold back on, it is just brilliant and, like you
say, 12 months ago I would really have aspired to be where we are now,
so I think it is real justification for our hard work.
That race, Classic in terms of a rolling sense, the only sport where
you can compete backward so you can see how much closer people are
getting to you. How difficult is it when you see the gap narrowing
inexorably, to keep your calm and hold on and keep your composure?
Really tough, especially having such a big lead, then the Kiwis
came back so strong. You could see how hard the Kiwis were going. Our
girls were very steady, probably a little bit too steady in some ways!
They were feeling fatigued. But just to stay cool under that
pressure and intensity, from last year they surprised me by the
silver medal they got, but certainly they have been backing
that up this season, then beating the world champions, very, very
impressive. A couple of weeks ago at Henley,
success almost across the board, but notably for the Men's Quad, but
also for the Red express off Wells and Bateman. The last time we saw
there was at Munich, where they finished third. Could they improve
technique is not great but the speed is that. Germany leading by
almost a length over a chasing field. Great Britain are second. At
the top of your picture, France are surprised that the British crew
have not launched a big attack. Looking forward, because in the
first 500, he borrowed champions New Zealand had a complete shocker.
They seemed to be working it back. Looking at Marcus Bateman work in
this crew. New Zealand just creeping up now, moving back on
France, who was white moving very sweetly at the top of the picture.
France and New Zealand beginning to move up alongside and through Great
Britain. Great Britain are going to have to make a move and react to
all of this. Germany seemed to be well clear. Now, here comes New
Zealand. New Zealand are absolutely flying. At they have clawed their
way back. And they have had to grind it out and grinding they are.
They were dumped on the first quarter mark, but they are world
champions, first at Hamburg three weeks ago and these guys looked
like they are screaming along. to 37 strokes a minute, that is
very high in a double scull. Germany went up very hard so might
people often the last five under. That is the wrong caption on the
left hand side. Germany in the league. Three boats hunting them
down, New Zealand leading from Great Britain and France, the
chasing pack. Germany out, and New Zealand continue to throw
everything at Great Britain, everything that Germany, and you
have got to think they could get an overlap with the Germans. The
British, Wills and Bateman, from the Leander Club, coached by Mark
Earnshaw, world silver medalists, been overhauled by world champions
New Zealand, and New Zealand have the bit between their teeth, they
can almost smell the Germans, and Great Britain has to go now that
these are on. Great Britain are at 39 strokes a minute, but New
Zealand even higher. Germany, beginning to fade. They went out so
hard, but this has been a sustained attack from New Zealand and look
how they have come through. 42 strokes a minute. They have gone
right through. That is an incredible performance from the
world champions, New Zealand. They get ahead of Germany, the early
race leaders. New Zealand, dumped in the first 500 metres, and they
have shown such class and style, showing why they are world
champions, in first place, recovered to win the gold medal.
Germany get the silver, and Great Britain get the bronze. If there is
one race and performance in terms of ducts from start to finish, that
is your crew. An extraordinary sprint. They sprinted from the 500 
metre long. Reminded me of 1992 when they started sprinting at
about 750 metres and you sprinted through the remaining world
champions, and Italy, to take the gold medal. That is what these guys
just dead. Heroic performance from easy on to take the gold medal.   
from New Zealand. I am Tom Solesbury. I am sometimes it from
the men's quad. The best thing about going for me is being truly
inspired by the dedication of my cronies. Seeing my competitors
faces after I have just crushed them. The best thing for me, Steve
Redgrave's Cola. It has been like this for two years! The worst thing
about going is getting up early morning in the winter, minus Mac
five. It is been nearly 30 and not having a penny to my name. I do not
get an even tan all over. Up to the 1,000 metre mark. Stretching out in
that middle second five, important to Neil the rhythm, hard. The
British grew up in Elaine one, led by Ben Lucas and Sam Townshend,
with Steve Rowbotham and Tom Townsend in the bows cease.
Switzerland, the whole nation is drawing the crowd on the Sunday
afternoon. The British qualified with the six slowest time in the
spinal so they might have to attack on every single stroke. They got
off well and it is the second or third 500 that they might have to
lay down their pace. But this last 500 metres, can be Max Brand? It is
difficult with a young, new crew to get that perfect cohesion when you
are up against it.    can they sprint? Good performance in this
first 500 metres, again. It is all about stepping up. The home nation
here on the Rotsee, Switzerland, all have these profiles in training
and replicate that at a higher intensity come race day, come the
finals. Germany have had a blistering third by pundits. The
race is very tight. The race is really on, very tight, for the
silver and bronze. Look at that water up there. Just delightful to
be up there. Every stroke, they get more confident down the line. Mark
Banks in charge of this crew, an inspirational coach, when it comes
to getting in among the big names, particularly Germany, the race
leaders. Germany have opened it up. Croatia, world champions, slipping
further back. Great Britain is in there, in the hunt, and winding it
up very well moving into the last 300 metres. Australia, the world
bronze medallists from 2010, they are now going for the line. The
crowds on the far bank enjoying the spectacle. Inside the closing
stages. Germany have gone away from everybody. Now the race is on
course over Foster on the far side you have Great Britain nudging
ahead, but the Australians are coming back, it is Great Britain
and Australia, four silver, and on the line, the British crew, what a
fabulous result, silver for Great Britain. And this British quadruple
scull are getting better and better. That was spectacular, spectacular
result of Great Britain. The quadruple scull, we have never got
a medal in this, this was a fantastic performance, and they
have got a lot more to give. Britain in second place to Germany.
Australia have been etched into the bronze medal position. What a great
position to be in going into the What are your thoughts on the
double sculls? They are going to be a little disappointed. They talked
about how hard it is coming out of Henley and coming into this. It is
a mental test, of the amount of races that you have been in.
Unbelievable, they were unbelievable, New Zealand, with
sheer guts and determination, and Germany hanging on for such a long
time, from halfway along. Our guys looked smoother but did not close
the gap. And the Quatt? Again, moving on all the time. It is
impressive over the last few years, it is a boat that we have not done
very well in since it became a world championship event, only
making the world championships three times in total now. But the
sport has got a chance of getting a medal. Beating Croatia at Henley
last week, and then coming out and doing it again this time, and
finishing in a strong position. They are going to feel very upbeat
after that. Carrying that through, year on year, it is getting better
and better. The finish of the men's single sculls, that was won by the
Czech Republic. Campbell is not competing here for us. It is the
wrong time of the year to be here. Yes, he has been up and down with
illness. You can never rule him out. But this season has been very
difficult for him. Normally, he confidence, but he was very
disappointed that Munich. He won at Henley last weekend, but there was
not that stiff opposition for him. Probably a good decision not to
raise it here. To re evaluate, and wait for the World Championships.
From when a New Zealand runner up to a New Zealand winner, he is the
single sculls,    here is Emma Trigg. Maybe her period of
domination in the game is coming to a close. Two races, two defeat by
Germany, can the men's eight overcome their rivals? We have the
latest hour from inside the camp. It is not all about rowing and
training. Sophie Hosking talks us through her day job. At the
Chambers Brothers combine for a pastime in a World Cup event as the
world champion lightweight or look to get back to the top. Let us
start with the Women's court. First place for them at the First World
Cup regatta of the Year in Munich   through the halfway mark in second
place to push on. Great Britain have been challenged by the United
States of America and by Australia on the left, and by New Zealand to
their right. Great Britain, still nice and relaxed. A length down and
Germany going through the halfway mark. You have the Americans
hunting down on the left. You want to start focusing on the boat ahead
of you, rather than defending the boats behind you. It is all about
mindset, chasing the boat in front, and everyone behind you doing the
work. Bury Sterry in the middle part of this race, obviously
working to a plan.    very steady. Germany have dominated this event
since its inception, only beaten two or three times in 30 years.
They are back on song. Back in the driving seat. But other crews now
are very close to them. Great Britain, having to make an attack
now. Otherwise, they are going to find there is too much to do in the
last 600 metres. Berry Flood and Annabel Vernon, silver medallists,
and this German crew knows what it is like to be in a monks ate, they
are world champions. As we head towards the 1,500m mark they have
to remain    have to remind themselves where they stand in the
world. Great Britain in second but New Zealand have taken on the
challenge over America, so, to their right, Great Britain have to
worry, to keep their eye or New Zealand who are, all the time,
tracking down Germany. They might have got a deal over lap. It is all
about winding them in Mike coming down the final part of the track.
That was a good move. Coming up to about half a length down on Germany.
Still, New Zealand pushing hard on the far side. Great Britain need to
do something special, and have to wind it right up, up to 39 strokes
a minute, and try to pull Germany back. Germany has worked very hard
to be where they are, but Great Britain should have the flexibility
bit of a head breeze coming in. The crews will have to think about
finishing. Great Britain have responded to New Zealand's
challenge and continue to pile the pressure on Germany. Now every
single stroke, the British are starting to move. They have about
150 metres, a little over 15 strokes. Surely Germany have done
enough to hold on to the challenge? The Germans are coming to the line,
the British are continuing to wind the rate up, but it will be gold
for Germany and saw the for Great Britain. Both crews moving away
from New Zealand. New Zealand coming through in the bronze medal
position. The exhaustion is evident in the British crew, they have had
to work hard in the last 500 metres, they gave away too much to Germany,
Tie, IM Sophie Hosking, international rower, lightweight
women's double, World Cup gold medallist and when I am not rowing,
I like to... Clean up contaminated land. Basically, I studied
chemistry and physics at university. It is an expanding area in
construction, it looked quite an interesting thing to get involved
with. Former petrol stations, Gasworks, we have worked on old
tips. Anything we can to help    do to help clean up the environment is
great. I get a bit of banter about hard hats and steel toecap birds.
They like the fact that people do other things apart from rowing,
they seem quite interested. It is nice to come down on the site and
chat to people who don't know what to do for the rest of the time and
maybe see you on television occasionally. Rowing will only last
for so long and I need something to going to afterwards. I am all done
are looking pretty strong in the leading position. Just shy of a
length over the United States of America. Great Britain are just
sitting, those markers were wrong, Great Britain are in third position.
Into the third 500, this is a really important 500. It is where
you start to think about building it in for a line. If you can sneak
a few strokes ahead and get the gap and anticipates when your
competition will move, that will stand you in good stead in the
closing stages. They seem to be stepping it up slightly. Canada
have moved on. They have just moved through the United States, they
have a tremendous amount to do to catch cannot afford stop they are
continuing to move ahead.    they have a tremendous amount to do to
catch Canada. Canada are well clear and under a lot of pressure. Lynne
degenerate into Tracy Cameron, the world champions in this event.   
Lynsey and Tracy Cameron. It is not as smooth as it could be. They have
great boat speed. The Canadians have a lot of lean back, it is
typical of the coaching in Canada. The surge at the finish of the
stroke gives the bowler to a good speed. It will take a big last 500
metres for the British double scull to overhaul Canada, the reigning
world champions. British are still in third place. That captured
remains wrong.    that captured the get an overlap, they are putting in
so much effort. The Canadians are just thinking about effort to keep
the gap going. Psychologically, they are coming at it from a very
different perspective. In amongst it all, the United States of
America are in lane number 3, looking to spoil the party for the
British double scull. But both crews... The Americans look higher,
they are taking more strokes per minute than the British crew. The
British really have to respond, they don't look as dynamic. Now
they are moving a bit more dynamically. You can see the speed
going into the water, the likes coming down, but the Americans have
responded. The race for silver is going on, and the race for the gold
medal is out front. Canada are looking back, they are looking very
relaxed. 125 metres from the line, they are not going to be challenged.
They made to keep an eye on Great Britain, who are slowly getting
through the United States of America    they need to keep an eye
on Great Britain. Inside the last 50 metres, long strokes coming from
the Canadians. The British crew are through the United States into
silver, they were almost have an overlap. Goals to Canada,    Gold
to Canada, so will the two Great Britain and bronze to the United
States to America.    Silva 2 Great The British will be happy with
their silver medal. What are your views on the women's
quad? Very good. I think they expect a bigger things in the first
race this season, rising British women's sculling expected bigger
things, a disappointing third, if you can be disappointed with the
bronze medal. But they have had quite a lot of illness and injury,
everyone has done different boats, it is very difficult. Two new girls
this time. A strong second place, I think they will be really pleased,
in some respects. And knowing that Fran is potentially coming back,
more strength to come, they will be really pleased that they were
pushing the Germans hard. Do you think Sophie and Hester, I was
going to say are outside contenders, but they are live contenders?
always have very mixed results. Over the last few years they have
had a couple of very good results, got to the major championships and
disappointed a little. Last year they did very well during the
season. I think they have really been given strength, they have not
been as dominant this year at the World Cup, but I think they have an
inner belief they can perform at the highest level. Why not take the
gold medal this year? And London 2012 next year, even better?
Talking about lightweight doubles, you think about Purchase and Hunter,
the Olympic champions. The men's weight    race was won by New
Zealand. What do you think about the future of their partnership?
disappointing results at the First World Cup race. Coming back from
that, one of them came down with a virus. It has taken a long time to
recover from. Rumours within the camp have said if they can just
qualifier the boat this year with the championships, that is all we
are worried about. When the pulley player comes back, he adds so much
to the crew. Hopefully he will be back for these world championships.
If he is back, the contenders will be... But on the grapevine, it is
let's concentrate on next year. Let's talk about the lightweight
fours, which invariably provides the most exciting race. This
particular event is very special for the Chambers family, both
brothers competing in the same boat in a World Cup for the very first
it, it is tight. At the halfway mark, very little between all six
boats. Australia have kicked back, the South Africans are leading
slightly. Australia, who had a bit of a slowdown into the second 500,
they are at speed again. This is the most exciting race. Really
can't afford a single mistake on any single stroke. They had just
slipped into the lead, I don't know why the chart on the left showed
them in 5th, they were well up. They have just eased into the front.
Can they sustain it? Can they turn it on in the last 500 when
everybody will attack? Richard Chambers is in the bow seat, his
brother Peter is also there, Paul Mattick, Rob Williams, a really
good, tight knit group. We are watching Switzerland in lane number
to. Great Britain are coached by Rob Morgan. Very good experience,
they trust each other, which will now be called for as we get towards
the business and. 750 metres to go in the final of the men's
lightweight coxless four. The crew average maximum individual cannot
exceed 72.5 kilograms, the crew average cannot exceed 70 telegrams.
What Denmark at the top of the picture as they really start to
motor.    and what Denmark.    and discount a single boat at this
stage in the race. The British are right up there, almost on the edge
of a sprint. They have probably got one more sprint level to go.
Switzerland in amongst it all, hanging on for dear life. In lane
number 1, Denmark a game will push on hard. Switzerland are 40 strokes
a minute, Great Britain moving up through 39 strokes a minute. Still
a little bit more to go. Chamber as his four years younger than his
older brother. He just slotted in and it is really sweet    chambers
his four years younger. They are being attacked, here we are in the
dangerous part of the race. 200 metres remaining, surely they have
done enough to hang on? Every single one of them is coming back.
Great Britain are in front, they are moving away, it has been
beautifully timed. They have moved it up now and in the last 150
metres they are shooting. British crew have done enough, but
the Australians attack harder. Here come the Italians and the Danes,
but it is gold for Great Britain. It is sold before Italy, we wait
for the full,    it is a silver medal for Italy, we wait for the
full confirmation for the bronze medal. Brotherly love, that is
great. What a triumph for Peter Chambers to be a winner here and,
as I say, the injured Chris Barclay will struggle to get back in, that
was a very sweet line up. All credit to Rob Williams in the
stroke seat, he did a great job. wonderful performance for Great
Tallis about your little brother and what he has done?    tell us
about? I am so proud. To come into a boat that expects gold every time,
that is massive. He delivered a good performance and support to
this the whole way through. We have come away with a whim, he has shown
his immaturity of the last couple of weeks and it has been awesome to
race with him.    he has shown his maturity over the last couple of
weeks. Haven't you won more than he did at the age of 21? I don't know,
we will have to see! We did some good races, we had a good plan and
went out and did it. How special was it to row with your older
brother? It is our first time together, and the fact that we won
on the properly    on the first time we race to together, I am
proud. Tremendously exciting and a great result. You can get too
carried away, but fantastic for the Chambers family? Brilliant for the
brothers and the family. I think it is outstanding the way they
conducted themselves over this week. They were bitterly disappointed
with their performance at Munich, even though they came back into it
in the last race, but they were swaggering around as world
champions, we are the best. They did not produce the goods they felt
they could, they went away, worked on it and came back, you can always
see lightweight coxless fours, they are very tight. They were racing
some talented groups, who blew them away in lightweight terms. The
margin does not seem very much, but for some reason in lightweight fors,
it is a big margin. They will be pleased, going into the world
championships. Just a couple more races to show you, the Women's
Eight and the Men's Eight, but first he is Greg Searle with his
Ready? Hands on, and left. We in Munich for the first of the 2011
World Cup races, and it is the morning of the final. It is our job
to make sure that we do not play out the usual script for the
Germans, which is for them to get a place and does not to be able to
get back on terms. Today, we need to be different. Germany, the world
champions, out fast in the Green vote. Germany gets the gold, Great
Britain get the silver, they knew that they live in Germany slip
through too much in the vast 500 metres. We did play out exactly the
script which we have had before when racing the Germans. We had
hoped they would not be that fast, but they are fast, they trained
hard, too, and they rode quite well. The message is clear, we need to
make sure that we go faster because that is going to be boring, if that
happens every time between now and the Olympics. But I trust our
coaches and the rest of the team, that people want it and a hungry
for it, just as much as I am. It is 2nd July, 2011. Henley Royal
Regatta. It is a very classy event. The Australians are good and the
Germans are here. We need to be right on our game. Training has
been interesting for the last month. We have had a situation with E coli,
which meant that we did not race in my handbag. This is the first race
since Munich, which was five weeks ago now. And going to lose to the
Germans, but I feel like we have made progress and eventually we
will get past them. This gives us the rage, that we need to do
something about this. We have got to use that to make a stronger and
make us raise better next weekend, The legs will be burning but they
have to go one more time, to step up the raised profile, all the
training demand, around the 1,000  metre mark, but the Germans put
everything into the first half, and always just hang on. And Canada
going very strongly in lane five. The British crew continue to be up
there. They no they have got a quick second half, if everything
comes together. Germany have not got their usual one light lead at
the halfway mark. The British crew over in lane six, they no they have
to wind it up and reel in the Germans. USA at the top of the
picture, they were into place, but still moving quite well.    in the
5th place. The Germans are just running that bought out. The boat
once on an they are on to it very quickly.    the boat runs on.
Confidence in that German crew, sky high. America, in 6th place, in
early No. 1, in amongst it all as well. The United States are rowing
technically well. 10 McClaren, their coach, working hard on
getting their technique improved. He is trying to make them work in
small boats, just work a little bit more effectively, more in sympathy
with at the boat and with the water around them. A as we get the wards
the closing stages, there is going to be a lot of noise. 500 metres
remain. The Germans three quarters of a live up on the United States.
At Great Britain in and around third position. That caption was
wrong. Now the British have to just lift it up, keep tunnel vision in
the British crew and think about the 30 strokes up towards the line.
Dan Ritchie in the stern, pushing them on. He but the Germans will
sense everyone coming back at them. The latest days moving very fast
now. The United States are at 38 strokes a minute. Germany, looking
strong. They have the tandem rig in the middle of the board. Four or
five on the same side. And it makes that boat go straight and move very
well. You cannot see them, but there have been mounting a
challenge. They will be stunned by the fees from the Netherlands and
Poland but now they are moving. 200m remaining. The Netherlands in
Elaine four, pushing on, it is going to be a sprint for the line.
Great Britain fighting for the bronze medal. United States hanging
on, Germany has got the gold, benevolence attacked Great Britain
one more time, it is Germany for gold, and the British are now
coming, almost on the line, this could be for a medal, Germany
through, and it'll be a photo  finish for the silver medal between
Great Britain and the Netherlands. And it does not get any closer than
that. Germany hung on out there, ahead, but Great Britain had the
sprint to get in. Again, the Netherlands find the closing speech
to come right back into it.    speed. Silver for the Netherlands
and bronze for Great Britain. The great British crew on the medal
podium, but things getting so close America going through the 1,500m
mark    and the United States of America. They should think about
keeping the line, the quicker on the catches and they could catch
the Netherlands. If they can do that that would be a great sculp in
this race. Canada just crept up and crept up. The Netherlands being
left behind over the last bite hundred metres. Canada will start
to raise up to 38 strokes a minute, and try to match the Nikkei stays
on the run in.    the United States. The naked spacer America have led
the way. By    the United States experience there to let this slip
now. Lesley Thomson just driving on heart crew, 150 metres remaining.
Great Britain being pushed hard by Caroline or corner in lane one. The
Americans have pen strokes to the line. The Americans lead over
Canada. Not much in it. It is the US, from Canada, from the
Netherlands, from Great Britain. And that his goal to the USA.
Silver for Canada, the Netherlands get the bronze, and Great Britain
coming through in opposition. The I am going to ask a British    a
difficult question   which British victory as impressed you most?
is a difficult question to answer. Perhaps the Women's Pair. The match
were completely brilliant, dominant. And what style from the lightweight
four. By we have just had a cracking day. You have coaches
meetings coming up. Do you expect any change to these crews before
the World Championships? I didn't announce them on air. We have a few
things to talk about. But it is good decision making from a strong
position, to squeeze up the medals, and so on. It will be a hard
decision to make but we will announce the team on Tuesday week.
There was a time, 30 years ago, when one bronze medal would have
been regarded as a success. This is fantastic, isn't it? But a mite
cold, four Silva and two bronze    for gold, four silvers, and two
bronze. They might have put all this together, and if we can do it
in July and August of next year, that is going to be incredible. It
is almost East German like, in some ways. They used to win everything
when I started out, with two boats that would come first and second.
New Zealand are performing well as a team. But there is nobody else
who is there, in it. Germany have some good boats, but they are not
beer in debt. Almost every Olympic category, we are contesting for
medals. You do not want to get ahead of yourself, because pride
comes before a ball, but are we all lost on the cusp of this British
rowing team doing what the cycling team did in Beijing? Very possible.
I think that, to win as many gold medals as the cycling team, is
going to be very tough. But if you talk to any of the individual boats,
taking out the women's single, the weakest event, all of them have
chances of winning a medal. And if they could be gold medals. There
are 14 Olympic events. If you're talking about 13 Bury good chances.
   very good. Could you might hear as well? Yes, the double sculls was
even closer than the lightweight fours at Lucerne. Plenty more spoke
to alert you to on BBC television. The Open golf at San which starts
on Thursday.    Sandwich. You can follow that across all platforms.
Then the Rowing Championships at Lake Bled, coverage on the red
button and highlights on BBC One on You won't miss a stroke. Thanks to
everybody at the Bolton Regatta, and as you can see the sport at
this level is very vibrant. It has been lovely at this beer. And at
