And chugging back again!
Woo woo!
Phew! That was fun!
Oh, look!
This is my friend, Luke.
Luke went on a boat.
This boat travels on a canal.
Barbara's helping Luke onto the boat.
This is Tony. He steers the boat.
Tony's untying the ropes,
so that the boat can move off.
Here we go!
Welcome aboard! Thanks for joining us.
Short safety announcement before we leave.
There are five emergency exits on this boat.
Luke, I hope you have a nice day. Thanks for joining us.
Oh, look! There are some more boats!
There's a plane in front of us.
There's an aeroplane, way up in the sky!
Hello, swan!
That's right, Mum   hold on tight to Luke!
Under the bridge!
Hello!
There's so much to see from the boat!
That man's riding a bicycle.
And those geese are flying over some cars on a bridge.
Time to go home now.
Bye bye, Luke!
I liked that boat!
Oh!
I like Mr Tumble!
Hello, Mr Tumble!
