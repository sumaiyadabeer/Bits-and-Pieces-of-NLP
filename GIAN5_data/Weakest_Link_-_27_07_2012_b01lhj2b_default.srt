Here are today's team of nine contestants,
preparing for the show. Only one will go home with prize money
of up to £10,0000.
The others will leave with nothing as each is voted the weakest link.
Welcome to The Weakest Link.
Any of the nine people in the studio here today
could win up to £10,000.
They don't know each other. However, if they want the money,
they'll have to work as a team.
But eight of them will leave with nothing
Let's meet the team.
My name is Justine. I'm 28 and I'm a lawyer from Glasgow.
My name's Graeme. I'm a 22 year old business student from Ayrshire.
My name is Clive. I'm 44. I'm a music licensing advisor from Crystal Palace.
I'm Ann. I'm 58 and I'm a library assistant from Stamford in Lincolnshire.
I'm Ken. I'm 39. I'm a civil servant from Ballymena, County Antrim.
My name's Norman. I'm 70. I'm a retired postal officer from Brandon in Suffolk.
I'm Marion. I'm 37 and I'm a car sales consultant from Newcastle Upon Tyne.
My name's Harry. I'm 26 and I'm a sales administrator from Bristol.
I'm Lauren. I'm 45. I'm a college tutor from Haslemere in Surrey.
In each round the aim is to answer enough questions to reach the £1,000 target within the time.
The fastest way is to create a chain of nine correct answers.
Get one wrong, you break the chain and lose all the money in it. But...
say "Bank" before a question is asked and the money is safe.
However, you start a new chain from scratch.
Remember...
at the end of the round, only money that has been banked
can be taken forward.
Round One, three minutes on the clock.
We start with whoever's name is first alphabetically.
That's you, Ann. Let's play The Weakest Link.
The first question is for £20.
Start the clock.

You've breached your £1,000 target.
And that money will go through to the next round.
But, of course, one of you will not.
Remember, you'll have ten seconds less,
so you must streamline the team.
Who was worrying you?
Who is least likely
to do well in more difficult rounds?
One of you will leave with nothing.
Time to vote off the weakest link.
After a lucrative round, Ann is the strongest link,
as she banked the £1,000.
Although no one answered incorrectly,
Ken is the weakest link, as he gained the least money.
But what factors will the team take into account in the vote?
OK, voting over. It's time to reveal
who you think is the weakest link.
Nobody answered a question incorrectly
in that first round, so, Justine,
  why Harry?
  I just felt he dithered too long on the question he had.
That was enough for me.
Ann, why Harry?
He was the only one who hesitated.
Right. Well, Harry...
You've upset them. You didn't answer fast enough.
  That's the way it goes.
  Certainly for you. You are the weakest link.
Goodbye.
I do wish I hadn't told ALL my friends and family I was going to be on.
And I wish it wasn't quite so popular.
I voted for Norman, honestly, because he looks like Alf Garnett.
I think there are some dominant personalities,
who aren't as bright as they think.
Round Two.
You have £1000. There are eight of you left.

I cannot complete the question. And you won
£520 in that round.
But who can't you wait to get rid of? Who,
even at this early stage, is out of their depth? One of you
is about to leave with nothing. Time to vote off the weakest link.
Norman is the strongest link statistically.
Justine is the weakest, as she answered only one correctly.
But will the voting follow the facts?
Voting over. Time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
  Ann, how's it going for you?
  Not too badly at all,
  thank you.
  Enjoying it?
  Very much.
  We'll try and put that right.
  Why Justine?
  She got two wrong.
  Lauren, ever been to France?
  I love France.
  Ever done any French kissing?
  I love that too, but I couldn't remember it.
  Why Justine?
  She was the weakest.
  Marion, what do you do?
  I sell cars.
Are they new or second hand?
  Both.
  Right. So it must be tricky for you with your arithmetic
if I say that I want a 5% discount on a car.
You might give me a huge discount!
I've got a calculator.
Why Justine?
She got two wrong.
Right. Justine, your specialist subject is music, is it?
  Yes.
  And you don't know who John Lennon was married to?
  It's pathetic.
  So pathetic you're on your way. You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I wasn't expecting to go so early in the game.
But it's a very good team out there today.
£1000 in the first round. And we were going for it again
until I intervened.
I think Marion's suffering a wee bit under the pressure.
And Lauren as well, but the others  
Clive, Ken and Ann   are looking strong.
Round Three. You've won £1520. You're down to seven players.
We take ten more seconds off the clock and start with the strongest link.
Norman. Let's play The Weakest Link.
Start the clock.

Time is up. And that was,
to say the least, a spectacular round!
You won £20. Well done(!)
This will be hard to decide but who sticks out
as the most irritating,
worryingly dense, entirely unsuitable person
for the rounds to come.
Time to vote off the weakest link.
Norman is the strongest for the second time.
After banking £1000 in the first round,
Ann is now the weakest link.
Will the money she banked be enough to save her?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
We have a tie, team.
Ann and Marion have two votes each.
Marion?
  Why Ann?
  I can't remember her getting any questions right.
Is your memory a bit like your arithmetic?
  Probably.
  Ann?
  You don't make any jam at home in Lincolnshire?
  No, I can't cook.
  So you don't know about dewberries and blackberries.
  No.
  Only that dewberry's my favourite perfume.
  Why Marion?
  She had a bad round.
  All of us did, but I think she had a bad one.
  Right. Well.
When it is tied, the strongest link casts the decider. Norman.
You didn't vote for either of them, but you now decide to get rid of Marion or Ann. To help you,
although it shouldn't influence you overmuch,
if you don't wish, statistically Ann was the weakest,
since she didn't answer any questions correctly. That doesn't matter.
If you prefer to lose Marion, it is up to you.
  Reluctantly, I nominate Ann.
  Why?
Because she didn't get any right and Marion, I think, did.
  Why reluctantly?
  I hate to see anybody go. They're nice.
Why are you here? Didn't you understand?
  I'm soft hearted.
  Are you?
Ann, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
Good luck, everybody.
It was the right choice. I didn't get any right. I started brilliantly,
but it got worse. So I think it was very fair.
Marion is probably the weakest one left and maybe she'll go next.
Round Four. You've banked...
..out of a potential prize of £3000.
Six of you left. Another ten seconds coming off. You now have 2½ minutes.
We start with the strongest link.

Which one of you now would not be missed?
I urge you.
Turf off the tiresome.
Eject the idiot. Time to vote off the weakest link.
Clive is the strongest link statistically.
The weakest link is Lauren. She answered everything incorrectly.
But what factors will the team take into account in the vote?
Voting over. Time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Graeme, why Lauren?
She got all her questions wrong
and didn't give me anything to bank.
That's a very good reason. Clive?
Why Lauren?
She was unlucky and had a bad time with the questions
but got them wrong. Sorry, Lauren.
Ken. Geography, literature, sport. Just some of the subjects you know nothing about.
And pigs.
Why Lauren?
She got a bad run of questions. Three or four wrong in a row there.

There was a lot on pop music. I read books and old fashioned things.

  Sociology.
  Don't you think pop culture is an important part of Sixth Form learning?
  I do.
I hope they're watching. You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I WAS the weakest link. I didn't get one right.
They were very generous in their comments.
I think I was more the missing link.
I'm a gambling girl and, if I was putting on money, I'd put it on Ken to win.
Round Five. Your total so far is:
If you'd hit your targets, it would be £4000.
Five of you left. Another 10 seconds off. We start with the strongest.

Time is up. And you banked a pathetic £170. Who is now surplus to requirements?
Who should be stopped before they cost you any more money? Time to vote off the weakest link.
Norman is the strongest link for the third time.
Graeme is the weakest link as he answered no questions.
But who will lose out in the vote?
Voting over. Time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Ken, why Graeme?
He got the most wrong in that round.
Norman, why have you voted for Graeme?
I think he was unfortunate to get questions specific to London.
He was unfortunate to get those.
  Would you not like ones specific to London?
  would, but he's not a Londoner.
Oh, I see. You think we should ask questions specific to a person's area?
  It makes it easier if you come from there.
  Marion, you'd like questions specific to where you come from.
  Of course.
Would that make the geography questions easier?
Hopefully.
You're not very hot on history or music either.
Rather like your arithmetic.
Yeah.
I hope you sell cars better than you answer.
Why did you vote for Graham?
  I think...
  Can you remember?
  ..he got them all wrong.
  What?
  All of them wrong.
  And YOU only got three wrong(!)
Graeme, with three votes you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
Ann was quite late on her insults to me, which I counted
my lucky stars for. She's a terrifying presence.
When she says your name, it's like a knife.
I think Marion will go next.
She's been clinging to the edge the last few rounds.
She's the weakest of the bunch.
Round Six. You started so well and it's been downhill ever since.
Out of the £5000 you could have won, you put into your kitty just:
There are four of you left. We are cutting
ten seconds from your time. We start with Norman. Let's play The Weakest Link.
Start the clock.

The correct answer is Robert Macgregor. In that round,
my goodness!
We are nearly fainting with admiration.
You answered just five questions correctly,
and you won £40.
Who shouldn't even be here today?
Whose train fare was a great waste of money?
It's time to vote off the weakest link.
After a tough round, Clive is the strongest link.
The weakest link is Marion, who answered none of her questions.
But how will the voting go?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Clive, why Marion?
She was very unfortunate, but I had nothing to bank.
Right. That's good enough. Ken, why Marion?
Again, a bad round.
She got the most questions wrong, I think.
Only two more than you, Ken.
  It wasn't an incredibly good round for you, was it, Ken?
  That's correct.
  Norman, you went off course in that round too.
  I did. She was slightly worse than I was.
Only slightly.
  Marion, you lost your nerve?
  Yep.
You banked half the money banked, but it hasn't saved you.
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I'll probably get the mickey taken for that donkey answer about the £8 that I didn't get,
and having Anne go on at me about being in the motor trade.
I'd like to see Clive go next because he voted for me in the last couple of rounds.
But he'll probably win.
Round Seven.
..won so far.
You've got rid of all the women, and a couple of men,
so no doubt the noughts will be falling off the bank balance.

Bank.
Well, gentlemen, the time is up,
and how well you did,
having thrown off all the women(!)
Of the £1000 available to you, you won £20.
And, impressively, you answered four questions correctly.
I won't embarrass you by listing how many you couldn't answer.
In Round Eight, on the assumption that you bank anything at all,
which on current form is unlikely,
you can treble what you bank.
And that means in the next round, potentially there's £3000 to be won.
Are you going to be courageous and greedy?
Are you going to vote off the person
least likely to raise your bank balance,
and hang on to your most fierce opposition?
Are you cowards?
It's time to vote off the weakest link.
Clive is the strongest link for the third time.
The weakest link is Ken for the second time.
But, at this crucial stage, who will lose out when it comes to the final vote?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Well, well, well.
  Norman.
  Yes.
  Why Clive?
  I'm sad to see him go, but I'm afraid he had to.
  Why?
I haven't got a good answer.
You must know why you chose him.
  It was either him or Ken. I chose Clive.
  Why?
  Alphabetical.
  You expect us to believe that?
  No.
  So you're a coward?
  Oh, yeah. In a long line.
Right. OK.
Ken. Why Clive?
I think Norman's been more consistently strong.
That's rubbish, isn't it, actually?
I don't believe so, no.
Clive was the strongest link in that round.
And then there's you, who didn't answer a single question correctly,
and thinks that Yorkshire's a city.
Indeed. Any answer's better than none.
Clive, you were the strongest link.
You might now regret you got rid of the women,
who might have shown more bottle
in the face of taking on the best player.
You banked the most money   the only money   £20.
However, Ken and Norman don't want a fight on their hands,
at least, Norman doesn't.
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
It's sad to get this far and be voted off,
especially as I thought I had a chance.
To be honest, I think it should be Ken that should be standing in my place now.
I came to win. I came close. I am disappointed.
But there's no disgrace. I thought I did well.
And I left as the strongest link.
Round Eight.
You've won...
Ken and Norman, just the two of you left,
and this time you have only 90 seconds.
This round's money will be trebled and added to your total.
So, £3000 is at stake in this round.
You voted off the strongest link,
so we start with the second strongest link Norman.
Let's play The Weakest Link.
