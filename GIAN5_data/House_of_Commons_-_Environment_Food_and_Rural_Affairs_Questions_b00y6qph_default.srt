Questions to the Secretary of State for Environment food and rural
affairs. I have had various discussions
about North Atlantic mackerel and a Council of meetings in Brussels in
it Iceland and the Faeroe Islands. In light of this the EU have agreed
to table sanctions against both the    Iceland and the Faeroe Islands
if no agreement is possible. will be aware of the Commons of the
Icelandic government that the proposed to block on Icelandic
vessels lined in mackerel in he port is not effective given that
most of their catches is landed in Icelandic port. Is it not time for
this to be dealt with seriously and for Iceland's exertion t EU to be
put on hold until this discussion is resolved. I entirely agree. My
consultations across the Government have centred across the case that
it is a strange way to behave for a country that is seeking to join the
club to tear up the rule book before it even enters. We are
seeking to ensure that their accession to the EU is also
included in the elements of their behaviour in relation to this.
support the honourable gentleman's of view on the rules about the
quota. Are there any other views on quota specifically for the ten 
metre fishermen that he may wish to share in his discussion so we do
not have a crisis? We are surely to consult with the industry about
changes to our domestic fleet and how they operate and how we can
There is approximately 1% of the eggs surveyed in Icelandic waters.
There is an obvious way for them to negotiate on this and they urge
answer questions 2, 3 and 6 together.
We are pursuing a policy to minimise discards through a reform
of the policy in 2012. A reform is also being taken domestically to
improve the utilisation of on affordable fish catches. Levels
have been decreasing year on year since 2002. I'm determined to drive
further action forward. grateful to the Minister. Are there
any lessons we can learn from countries like and Norway, Iceland
and the Faeroe Iceland    the Faeroe Islands who have managed to
replenish their fish stocks? What is undoubtedly clear is that the
common fisheries policy is broken. It is based around a very
centralised top down system. What we have to do in terms of how we
reform it is to decentralise it, to make it also, the management of our
Fisheries relevant to how we manage the marine environment as a whole.
We can learn lessons from other countries. They are not
repositories of entire virtue as we have heard. But there are lessons
we can learn. I'm very grateful for that reply from the Minister. Was
he like me, shocked to see the recent television documentary about
fish discards and appalled at the behaviour that fishermen who work
so hard have to follow because of the rules? Will he assure me that
he is not just working on this since the public outcry but since
he got this job? I applaud the Fish Fight campaign and the programme
launched and very ably produced by Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall. The
one criticism I have is the line that the fightback starts here. The
fightback started many years ago in fairness to the previous Government
and also to this Government who have been working extremely hard on
catch quotas come on fishing for the market, any variety of
different measures to reduce discards. I'm happy to work with
anybody and we need to win public support on this so I think the
programme was a complete success. As the last Conservative fisheries
Minister in the previous Government I thought he was considerably
better at identifying fish at Billingsgate than I ever would have
done. I think the whole House would support him on the need to reform
the Common Fisheries Policy. For those who were opposed to quotas,
reducing and protecting, reducing fishing and protecting fish stocks
by reducing effort is no less easy an option and we have to face up to
the reality that fishermen are not going to be wanting to keep their
boats in court. I'm very grateful for his kind words. Being
interviewed at 5am I would be very hard pressed to recognise my
children let alone fish stocks. I'm grateful to my friends and enemies
who have sent me fish charts. My honourable friend is right, there
is no one size fits all for this. We have to deal with the problem of
quotas and the mixed fishery is a problem. That has been part of the
drive it was discards we are so keen on working down. I know the
Minister is well aware of the pioneering efforts of the Scottish
fishery to dramatically reduce the number of discards going into the
North Sea. Something like 30%. I know that people in the coastal
communities are very pleased that this issue is now getting the wider
prominence it deserves and has deserved for a long time. I'm
grateful to the Minister for outlining his Government's efforts.
I still have some questions as to whether there really is the
political will needed to make the changes necessary to tackle
discards. We welcome your commitment but... We have to have a
question. I applaud the work of her constituents. I'm glad we were able
to expand the scheme in the December round. She is right, we
have to build alliances across the European Union and I am working
extremely hard to do that in Council meetings and elsewhere so
that the block it supports us and the radical end up of the reform
spectrum. So there we can achieve the reforms that mean that discards
a riffing of the past. So that we have got sustainability at the
heart of our fisheries management policies. One of the methods used
to deal with the problem of overfishing and depleted fish
stocks of the Marine Conservation Soames. Could the Minister update
the House on what he's doing to issue more conservation zones?
are progressing the implementation of the Marine Act which will see
marine conservation zones around the coast. We have four project up
and running. I'm working hard to ensure that they are properly
resourced and that they are working towards the timetable of 2012. I
hope they will be able to deliver on that and there will be keeping
the House informed and that progress. At recent talks in bed
and I was able to support wider work on it international fisheries
and Fisheries partnerships which is key to making sure that fishery
conservation measures are not just in our own work    waters but
followed up elsewhere as well. Would the Minister agree that hours
of Denmark has shown, further action could be taken by this
Government in conjunction with the devolved administration to cut
discard levels this year? Will he seek approval for an increase in
the scope of this year's catch quota trials which half the
Scottish White Fleet expressed and interest in joining? Will he
research investment in a more selective next and it on board
CCTV? With these measures add up to an effective national action plan
to end this appalling waste of good quality fish for good to? There is
a very clear strategy in the UK Government to make sure that we
bring down discards. We do not wait until 2012 to achieve that. We have
got fishing for the market which is addressing 54% of that discard. At
the catch quota trials we managed to get an extension of it. But to
choose the virtue of catching less but landing more. That is the Holy
Grail of Fisheries Management. Progress continues to be made in a
growth    addressing the dire legacy described vividly in the
independent review of the RPA last year. Despite the issues in
Updating farmers maps and reduced staff numbers they met their target
of to pay claimants by the end of December. But there is still very
much to do. It will inevitably take some time to redress some very long
outstanding problems. I was going to ask the Minister to recognise
the work of the farm crisis Network and the pastoral and practical
support for farmers working under stress. Particularly the co 
ordinator in Somerset. In Somerset there were 12 new cases and so   
10th January of whom raised to Â£295,000 for farmers unable to pay
for feed or unable to sell their stock. Can I ask particularly that
they eat accelerate the cases of farmers... Minister. I have huge
admiration for the work of farm crisis Network. She rightly says
they support some very hard pressed particularly small farmers for whom
the single farm payment is a major part of their income and without it
they are in desperate straits. I am determined that the RPA finds a way
forward to get some cash into their hands as soon as possible but in
particular cases if she would like to write to me I'm happy to pursue
When the Minister say how many staff will be cut because of
spending cuts and can he explain how this will speed up payments to
farmers please? Mr Speaker, the honourable lady assumes the RPA was
working efficiently. It certainly wasn't as the last question
demonstrated. The reduction in public expenditure means the RPA is
having to take a reduction in staff alongside other bodies. At the same
time, it is becoming more efficient be better work practices and the
Chief Executive who started a fortnight ago. I am convinced we
The public Forest estate consultation explores models for
the ownership and management of the estate and how important public
benefits like excess can be maintained. An example will be held
these conditions can be used to ensure access and other public
benefits are protected. In addition to established legal rights of way,
were she and sure protections for access rights that are currently
permitted access only and safeguard access for bicycles and horses?
With a lengthy debate last night, I made clear permissive access rights
are limited in number and are on loan that the public forest estate
does not own. For when the Secretary of State tell the House
the figures projected for the next 10 years for the revenue that will
come from the public forest estate and show whether they in fact will
offset the costs to the benefit to the Exchequer? They are different
types of forests that are subject to different proposals under our
consultation document which is a genuine consultation. The planned
sales, the continuation of the programme of the previous
Government, is expected to raise Â£100 million over the period of the
spending review which will be part of DEFRA overall provision.
welcome the Secretary of State's genuine consultation. When will she
be bringing a statement back to this House when that has finished?
First of all, or we need to make it clear that this is a genuine
consultation. Unlike a lot of consultations, we want as many
people to take part, it is a statutory three month period,
ministers will reflect on those considerations and bring to the
House our considered view in timely fashion. Public access is
absolutely vital to local communities and though the
Secretary of State talks about a consultation period, before that
period is over, the Government will start selling of 10,000 had tears
of public forest land. More than was sold in Labour's entire period
in office. My question is, what right will communities have to bid
for that land? How long will they have to raise the money? Will it be
sold on leasehold? Is it right the selection for this year
deliberately avoids woodland which gives public benefits because they
want to maximise the assets the capital raised from the assets?
criteria for these planned sales is set out in the public domain on the
Forestry Commission website. They are a continuation of programme of
sales taken place over the last three decades. Her own Government
sold off 25,000 acres without the protection that this Government
will provide. We sold that of to re  invest it in the forest. This
has been re  invested in flood defence schemes. The land that is
being sold will be sold with no higher rights of public access.
Honourable members should think carefully about what is happening.
Isn't the case on the public Forest, the honourable lady doesn't know
where she is doing, does know where she is doing it and nobody wants
her to do it. Isn't it time to stop and think again? I think the
honourable lady wasn't clearly listening last night to the fact
that ministers have repeatedly given assurances in this House,
that access and other public benefits will be protected. In the
land that fits the criteria of the Forestry Commission, many of these
lands personally don't have access attached to them. The honourable
lady should reflect carefully on our consultation document and gain
a better understanding of what happened when he reads what was
sold off under the conditions of her Government, her contract,
without protection, where access is The UK Sports for the global ban on
national trade in ivory.    supports. While one of cells have
been permitted, no further sales of ivory take place without firm
evidence that such sales will reduce poaching. In the UK, we
employed domestic midges than those required concerning the trade in
ivory. I think the Government is doing a good job building on the
work of the previous Government in this area. There is still a great
deal of concern that we are not tackling where the exchange takes
place, which is within the internet. Whether the Government has any
plans for four trying to stop the sale of ivory through internet
transactions? It is right to point out to this development in the
illegal trade in ivory. It is for that reason that we continue to
support schemes that give us evidence. The mutterings of the
illegal Cliffe    killing of elephants, we support these
international efforts to make sure we understand the problem. We have
our house in order and I am impressed by the level of expertise
that exists in a variety of agencies and I will ensure we
continue to play our part. Government has recently responded
to the European Commission's communication, the common
agricultural policy towards 2010. Our response calls for reform of
the Cap, that will enable farmers to meet the challenges and
opportunities of the future. thank the Minister for her answer.
The second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy currently
provides essential support to farmers to deliver environmental
public goods. Which of the European Commission's proposed option for
reform does the Minister think best balances the need to maintain
landscape and diversity with food production and protect the consumer
and tax payer? If the whole of the commission's proposed reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy should address those twin challenges she
describes. It is a combination of the direct payments and the
payments and a pillar to, but in particular in this country, there
will be used for stewardship schemes, that pays balances with
food production. That is whether coalition Government is committed
to increasing by 80 % higher level stewardship. The Minister will be
aware of the unease in farming unions in Wales and the Welsh
Government into the cap reform. Will she inform the House what
progress she is making in making a joint progressing on this issue?
right honourable friend and I took the earliest opportunity to invite
the Welsh minister of our culture to meet the commissioner with this
as early of    as to last year. We have had successive meetings with
the devolved administrations and will continue to go on doing so as
the reform process is likely to take a great deal of time. In the
Welsh Assembly position, we have much in common and there is much
that we can do as we negotiate this reform to make sure we get a good
deal for the farmers in Wales. ought to declare my register of
interest has been one of the field practising farmers in this country.
When she considers... In this Parliament! Will my right Hon
double front, where she it considers the reform of the Cap,
facial Europe is going to be an important place in which
agriculture can feed the world, will she move away from the falls
in it, tobacco, which is such poor quality then everyone's to use it,
can she ensure these practices are stopped? I think it is of the
utmost importance that farmers in Europe are encouraged to produce
more food and to do so sustainably. If we look at the threats to our
society globally if, from food security, it is clear that the
nations that have the capacity to increase production to do their
sustainably, are the ones they should    that we should be fully
behind. The Secretary of State, I mean due no harm but as the second
closet European in the Cabinet, would she agreed that if we are to
reform Cap, no use across this chamber, we have to convince our
European friends. I have some good news for the right honourable
gentleman. In the coalition agreement, it to say clearly that
coalition desires to be a positive participant in Europe. My
honourable friends and I have set aside building alliances and
reforms that will benefit taxpayers, farms and consumers. Among style
traditional friends at the Scandinavian countries, the German
and the English and Welsh farming unions in this country are close.
That alliance is what brings about I am pleased to report that there
has been a significant reduction and the number of colonies lost
from all causes. Losses over the 2009/10 winter, were 16 % compared
with 30 % in a seven/08. Case also of foul disease have decreased.
Clearly it is too early to know the results for this current winter bet

Mr Speaker, I can tell the honourable member that the previous
Government did commit Â£4.3 million of resources in to be health and of
which 2 million was in the insect pollinators initiative and 2.3
million into the healthy plan. Those we hope will deliver results
but I have to say, it was only as a result of a massive campaign by
backbenchers on all sad that that Number 11. The Environment Agency
has been consulting regional flood defence committees on the programme
for 2011/12. The agency's board will be decided the allocation of
funding to each region up shortly. Schemes will be published as soon
as possible. Funding will depend on the outcome of death for's   
DEFRA's. Homes there were devastated by the floods in 2008
have learned that planned flood defences have now been deferred.
What message does the Minister have for these people who as well as
living with the worry of future floods, have added financial
concern of losing all insurance cover because these defences are
Those schemes have not been rejected they will be looked at
again to ensure that they can come forward with good value for money
for the tax payer. The second thing is that we are now consulting on a
payment for outcome scheme which will give transparency for the
first time to flood funding to allow local communities to
understand where they are in the pecking order and how they can
assist in making sure that their flood schemes come forward. On the
insurance point we are working closely with the ABI aid to make
sure that we can make sure their race car that in the future.
Everyone realises that money is tight but can I ask the Minister to
look again at the importance of the Leeds flood scheme. In 2007 the
city centre was centimetres from flooding. This is an incredibly
important scheme and it simply cannot be left to gather dust.
conscious of the importance of this scheme to the people of Leeds. I
think that there is much work to be done to ensure that parts of it and
are brought forward in a viable form in the coming future. My right
honourable friend has had discussions with his colleagues and
would be happy to meet with him and discuss the intricacies of this
scheme. At the moment, it is roughly going to cost about a
quarter of a million pounds per property. That is an extremely
difficult some to get around in terms of value for money. There are
many other schemes which have come forward which give a much better
benefit. I very much hope that we can work with the local authority
and with honourable members to make sure we can bring forward certainly
elements of this scheme. It is a matter of fact that the Government
has decided to cut flood defence spending by 27%. These cuts have
meant that the Environment Agency has had to change the way it
allocates resources to its outcome measure assessments. Will the
Secretary of State today give a guarantee, not assurances but a
guarantee, that haircuts will not prejudice flood defence schemes in
   that her cuts will not prejudice fledged defence schemes in rural
areas. I assure the honourable gentleman that our proposals will
make it easier for communities that have traditionally missed out. Such
as those he describes in rural areas. There is a clarity it in the
way that funding is allocated. I would just correct him, in the
direct comparison of funding, we are spending approximately 8% less
than the last Government did over the same period. His party did
announce a year ago 50% capital cuts. If he was sitting over this
side he would have to explain if he was going to favour flood of
funding or where else he was going to make the cuts. Since the
beginning of October last year we have received 4,200 representations
on the sale of the public Forest. Most of these were responding to
press coverage, not the real consultation which was published on
27th January. Is it not the case that it should be clear to even
this Government that the idea of selling off our forest is a very
bad idea and has no public support? Will the Minister abandon this
policy before she is forced to due to public pressure? I would think
perhaps the honourable member was not in the House last night where
a... So allow me to remind him that in the last months before the
general election the Government of which he is the member of the party
published a programme setting out the case for long term leases of
the public forest estate and the case for getting "greater
commercial benefit from the public forest estate". I have had more
representation on this issue than any other issue since I was elected.
Probably about 500 so far. If I send them on can the Secretary of
State reassure my constituent that they will all be counted as
individual submissions to the consultation. I can give my
honourable friend that reassurance and I believe that more honourable
members should to encourage their constituents to read the genuine
consultation. We would welcome respondents to this genuine
consultation. Given that 60% of the private English forests out of the
public forest estate are under managed and that only 16% meat
forestry standards compared to 100% of Forestry Commission land is the
public not absolutely right to oppose a sell off? I do not accept
that it puts biodiversity at risk because it is something that I'm
particularly committed to enhancing and improving. I think the
honourable lady's. Does remind us that the public for us commission
only covers 18% of forest in this country. They would continue in a
regulatory role and I would expect it to help us achieve even higher
standards of maintenance in private and public forests. Bearing in mind
her concerns about public perception there she not agree that
now is the time to provide both clarity as to the conditions and
how the 40,000 Hector's will be disposed of? I'm happy to provide
clarity but the criteria under which the continuing sales of land
as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review planned relief is
published on the Forestry Commission website. They look
primarily for sites that are less accessible and sides with large
requirements for expenditure. That information is in the public domain
and I'm sure you can help. People in the right direction. I have read
the information which says that it is nothing to do with the costs or
the benefits. We know that the Government is not listening to the
Big Society or the community because community groups are
desperately worried about having to take responsibility for their woods
and forests. I know that today the Secretary of State has not
mentioned her phoney argument about regulation because it is a week.
One question remains. Why is the Secretary of State determined to
sell off up our precious woods and forests? This was part of the
debate last night. It is very clear that the opposition does not want
people, community groups and charities, to be able to take
ownership and management. That is clearly a divide between our
parties. This is not primarily about cost. The point about
regulation still stands. The Forestry Commission is both
regulator and the largest seller of timber in the market that it
regulates. In this day and age that kind of conflict of interest cannot
continue. I apologise very much for the unacceptably long delay in
resolving the issues on Mr Philpott's spending claims. For
clarity up to the House I should mention that I know him personally.
It is one example of the dire legacy of the Rural Payments Agency.
I understand he is eligible to top up payments which will be made by
the end of this month. Resolving underlying problems will take
longer but I am committed to seeing that permanent solutions are found.
The Minister it kindly knowledge is that the RPA has failed my
constituent over a long period of time. Will the Minister detail in
writing what has held up the claim so far and which entitlements are
causing the problem in time for a meeting on 15th February between
the NFU and Mr Philpott? To be honest, I am not sure that I can
write to him detailing which particular transfers or
entitlements are wrong. The problem is the computer system which is
completely at an    inadequate for its purpose, it is not fit for
purpose especially with very complex cases such as Mr Philpott's
where there have been a large number of transfers and
entitlements which have to be halted. I refer the honourable
member to the answer I gave earlier. Has the Minister consider the
merits of outsourcing the payments process of this agency to improve
performances and efficiency? short answer is yes. But I should
end for size that this point was one of the    I should emphasise
that this point was to be published last year. We have to ensure that
we can get the existing staff working so we do not interrupt
payments even more while we look at the whole process of outsourcing.
refer my honourable friend to the answer I gave earlier. Further to
the Minister's earlier answers and given that fish, like Forest, are
as much of interest as anywhere else. Can the Minister tell us what
he's doing about the Common Fisheries Policy and what he's
doing that telling people at home about the benefits of eating more
responsibly sourced fish? I give my honourable friend this example. The
project carrying out by a Defra at analysing the 50% of discards. Some
of them are perfectly delicious fish to eat. The other thing we
must bring forward is to make sure that it the public ask for marine
steward accounted accredited fish. They can ask for that at their
market. The common fisheries policy has probably been the most
unmitigated disaster in EU history. That is up against pretty steep can
to put    competition. The Minister himself says that the Common
Fisheries Policy is broken so why is he talking in terms of its
reform? Why does he not abolish it? I can spend all my energy trying to
unpick the Common Fisheries Policy from various treaties back to the
Treaty of Rome. What am dealing with isn't industry in crisis.
People's jobs. They want me to push at a door which is open. For the
first time the commission, I urge the honourable gentleman to read
the commission's position paper, they are decentralising this to get
it back to something where we can have more local control. That is
what the industry wants and what we all want. We are working very
closely with the Home Office and we expect an announcement shortly
regarding the antisocial behaviour issue in which dogs will be
included. Members across the House have experienced serious dog
attacks in their own constituencies and will welcome that answer. There
are serious concerns about the ability to implement any changes
that come from the consultation with serious and deep cuts to DC LG
and to neighbourhood policing. I would like the Minister Ed to
respond to that of. I cannot pre  empt announcements that the Home
Office for made shortly. I can assure him that the plan is not for
some massive public expenditure in the way that they go about it. He
will have to wait for the proposals published shortly. We are all
concerned about dangerous Dogs. We are also concerned about ordinary
dogs. There is a real risk to that person    perfectly normal dogs
which Bach might find themselves captured and when all encompassing
antique dog policy. Will he be careful about addressing the issues
the honourable gentleman rages    raises? We have to slightly
different perceptions here. One is of the dog can somebody wants to
use as a fashion will    fashion accessory like the pit bull. But we
look at the tragedies they are often household pets that for some
reason have gone wrong. We have to bear that in mind as we look at the
whole picture. The latest forecast of farm incomes
were published on 27th January. These indicate that average incomes
are likely to show a marked increase in 2010/11 on arable farms
but to form on    fall on livestock farms. I'm sorry to say that the
current price of grain will increase that differential. Is the
Minister aware that pig farmers incomes are expected to drop by a
60% and that the increase in which my honourable friend refers to for
arable farmers was only due to extra payments? Can he give the
House and the farmers and assurance today that it emphasis will remain
very much on farm production and insuring a fair return to our
produces? I do not think my right honourable friend is right to
attribute the rise in arable farming to the single payment. The
fact is that our approach to the Common Agricultural Policy is about
trying to drive up productivity and competitiveness and stop wasting
money in areas it should not be spent. That is why we want to see a
greater proportion of the spun    funding spent on pillar to. Could
the Minister please tell us what talks he has had with Treasury
colleagues about encouraging the banks to lend more to farmers? I
have farmers in my constituent    constituency and they are finding
that banks are changing terms and conditions and are refusing to be
The honourable lady is not alone in having constituents with those
problems. The Chancellor has already made a number of statements
on the subject, including ways in which he can press the banks to be
more open with their lending and perhaps charge less for it. DEFRA
has not undertaken assessments to the effectiveness of the Convention
on International Trade and endangered species. The convention
is delivering objectives of its strategic plan in August. He may be
aware of the recent cross border crackdown on illegal wildlife
smuggling in central Africa which led to arrests and the seizure of
150 kilograms of ivory, 1,000 African grey parrots, to lie in
skins and a grisly haul of eight heads. This was caught knitted by a
dedicated NGO. What is DEFRA doing to make sure they are supported and
making sure our endangered species must be protected? I certainly a
work with other colleagues to make sure we are, alternating    co 
ordinating. The real problem is the end user. We can have our house in
order here and our wildlife crime unit has a wonderful work
supporting the endeavours she talked about. We have to look at
those that believe these products are useful in medicine terms and
the use of ivory ornaments of. We have to do with that because that
is where the problem is coming from. The Minister will be aware that if
we are going to enforce this convention in Britain, we need to
ensure our airports and seaports, that we have the staff and customs
officers there to do this work. Can he assure us that there will be no
diminution in the effort put in to ensure these products are stopped
from being introduced in this country? I am working closely with
Home Office colleagues in the consultation in bringing forward
the border regime. I visited the reception    animal at reception
centre in Heathrow and have seen the expertise. We want to keep that
skill base active across the country. My department takes
responsibility for safeguarding the environment, supporting farmers and
strengthening the green economy. I'm sure members will join me in
welcoming the publication of foresight's latest report. This
excellent body of work is a searching and rigorous assessment
of the global food challenges between now and 2050 and I would
urge all members to read it. can't my it right honourable friend
give an unequivocal guarantee that any sale of Forestry Commission
land, existing public rights of access, will be maintained exactly
as they are at the moment, whether on a bicycle, foot or horseback?
The failure of her colleague in the other place yesterday to give an
unequivocal answer to that question, has increased public suspicion on
this matter rather than a laying it? My right honourable friend gave
precisely that undertaking last night in the debate and I believe
he has reiterated it again today. Campaign for Better Transport today
launched a Save Our Buses campaign. The research shows Cambridgeshire
County Council is prepared to phase out all County Council buses and
cancel all existing rural services. Can the right honourable lady tell
us what advice she has given the Department of Transport about the
impact of these buzz cuts on rural communities and roll economies?   
bus cuts. I am working with colleagues in the Department of
Transport to ensure a variety of different solutions are found to
rural bus services in particular. One of the problems is it is
extremely expensive and the vast majority of these buses transport
nothing but there. We need to have them more customer at responsive
Government can assist those in a variety of way. Will the Minister
agree that the new national forest which covers much of my
constituency in North West Leicestershire, is a model of what
can be achieved by the private sector and third sector in
delivering access access amenity and enjoyment of our Woodman's?
can. I met with representatives of the Forest Company this week. It is
a wonderful model of what can be achieved. It involves schools and
volunteers and has maintained improvement. Does the Minister
agree that with the Country Landowners Association, that pillar
one of the Common Agricultural Policy should increasingly deliver
environmental groups? Does he agree with the NFU, hoping this would
increase for    costs farmers. The Government believes a pillar to
is the better vehicle for the delivery of public goods which is
why we believe pillar one should be phased out. We can concentrate
resources on transparent payments to farmers for delivering access,
environmental benefits and a whole range of other public goods
including their own competitiveness. In my constituency, we are
fortunate to have the largest woodland in Cheshire at Delamere
Forest. Can the Minister assure me and my constituents that this
Government will protect public access rights to Delamere Forest?
Yes. Could I say to the Secretary of State that I will be
disappointed and so my constituents that this is diverted in terms of
the forest and Wogan's our country, and access. It is about ownership
and deepen the DNA of English people is a years of being fed up
with grace and favour saying you can walk on our land but you can't
own it. It is about ownership and access. As I explained, when his
party was in Government, they also looked at the ownership and access
issue. People in Northumberland will never forget the impact of
floods in committees. I wonder if the Minister will take a personal
interest in the more perf flood relation its cream    Morpeth flood
scream    a scheme. It was devastating.
I am more than aware of the impact of those floods. I am also very
aware of the fantastic community spirit that has come out of that.
Also in terms of ensuring there is resilience against flooding in the
future. I will give the right honourable gentleman the assurance
that I will meet with him at any time to make sure we can carry that
forward. More Perth is in my constituency and the townsfolk are
livid he by the fact that that the alleviation scheme is being
deferred. But the Secretary of State agree to meet me as a matter
of urgency did discuss the project? I am happy to meet with a gentleman
and the flood authority if he can make a time with my office. I am
sure my honourable friend has received representations about the
future of the public Forest's. I have over 3,000 acres in my
constituency. Public rights of way will be protected by law. Will the
Minister give me a guarantee that permissive access rights will be
protected, maintained and made available in any future management
agreements? It allows me to emphasise that there is a
difference between dedicated rights and permissive access. Dedicated
rights apply to over 90 % of the forest estate that we own and that
cannot be taken away. They cannot be removed. They are there for
perpetuity. A lot of people confuse it with permissive rights and the
only place in the forest estate where they are permissive rights,
is on land that we do not turn but owner by leasehold on main    999
year leases. We cannot dedicate that because the lease prevents us
to. All Forestry Commission and land has dedicated access which is
permanent. Farmers and many others are not able to get hold of grants
from the banks in order to further their cause. Will she therefore, in
the light of that, tell the banks that under no circumstances will
they be able to buy forests? have made it perfectly clear that
the Forestry Commission has a responsibility with any of the
planned sales of the public forest estate, to satisfy itself that
those who wish to do so are qualified and have the necessary
expertise to safeguard the high standards of protection for the
Environment, is biodiversity, public access and other public
A wanted to tell the Secretary of State that we are delighted in
Ealing Central and Acton, better work against dangerous dogs under
their owners has been recognised by Ealing has been selected to pilot
one of the schemes. Could you give us further details on that is how  
  on how that is intended to work? I admire my honourable friend's
pursuit. She is absolutely right to do so. To be clear, we congratulate
Ealing on applying to be a pilot scheme. No final decisions have
been made but we welcome their interests. The Secretary of State
earlier used warm tones in promising future positive
engagement with the devolved administrations on the future of
the Cap. We must engage would be on the basis of DEFRA continuing to
ignore be held views of the devolved administration on the
future of paler one?    pilaff one. A have been active    we have been
active and understand their importance of direct payments to
farmers. It is that insurance that devolved administrations are
seeking. For less favoured every    areas, recognition of the tanagers
of farming in less favoured areas is something that Government
ministers perfectly understand and will defend the use of. Can the
Minister of help and support to the monks of the set    in the
Pembrokeshire coast in wanting to induce the red squirrel to their
island? Can I applaud them and their member of parliament for the
scheme. They like me are looking at what has happened in Anglesey at
the eradication of the grey squirrel there which is almost
achieved and the benefits that it will have towards the regeneration
of the red squirrel which we are looking closely at for the North of
England. That week I had more representations from constituents
who were saddled with an adopted trains and so was. Can the Minister
give me an answer on how to this has progressed? We will be making
an announcement surely    shortly. We are determined to take forward
this part of the flowed Management Act. Recently in Wolverhampton, had
a serious issue of a dangerous dog attack. Does the Minister agree
that there may be provisions in place for police officers to have
adequate training to do with dangers dogs and the skills to
handle those situations? I have huge sympathy with what happened in
Wolverhampton, it is a tragedy that a well meaning fan are talking a
stray dog which then turned on their child. It couldn't have been
a worse situation. Wolverhampton City Council have advised that
where people find stray dogs, they should tell the council rather than
take them in. He is right to refer to the issue of training. Some
forces have spent resources on training their offices to do with
it    to deal with this properly and the rest should follow.
Yesterday in Victoria Gardens and there was a photo opportunity
organised by a Endemol defender's international, with an inflatable
elephant for MPs which was as surreal as a sound. To highlight
the fact that the DuPont is yet to arrive at conclusions into the
public consultation on banning of wild animals in circuses. Can the
Minister tell us when we can make     expect that announcement?
decision is imminent. It is very important, we are aware of the work
he has started and we will be making an announcement shortly.
Would the Minister of State please give us more detail on exactly what
is going to happen with IT management and mapping to speed up
payments particularly for small farmers? The RPA have been involved
in the last six to nine months with the providers of our IT system in
introducing what they apparently term, number of fixes to the system
to overcome many of the problems. They are working through to get rid
of some of the backlog. We will shortly be making a decision to
make some manual payments to ensure The forest that will form the bulk
of the income that will support the Government's plan to sell off
national heritage. Is home to 13th sites of scientific industry, as
well as red squirrels and Osprey, yet the Government classifys it as
yet the Government classifys it as "commercial". What guarantees can
you give us that the public and conservation interest will be met
in perpetuity. We need to be clear that the forest is predominantly
commercial, but contains sites of scientific interest and other
recreational amenities that will be protected in addition to the
legislation in place n statute, that protects such things, by
conditions set in the lease, if that is the outcome that arises
from the proposals in consultation. Following the very important
recommendations laid out in the Forsyth report last week on the
role of agricultural research in tackling climate change, what
recommendations with the Secretary of State make to European
colleagues to make sure we have a regime in Europe that encourages
agricultural innovation. regularly raise these issues with a
number of European Commissioners, not just DG Agri. I have on a
number of occasion, with European agricultural commissioners
commended the work of this report, for the warning that it gives, the
food and farming and research community about the twin challenges
of environmental change and food security, which means that we have
to use all our endeavours to build the capacity in European
agriculture, to produce more food sustainably for a hungry world.
Thank you Mr Speaker. The consultation on the Dangerous Dogs
Act did pose the possibility of extending public land to private
Government going to make that commitment when it announces its
outcome to the consultation to were tect workers like doctors, midwives
and post men   prospect workers like doctors, midwives and postmen
and women. The honourable lady is right the consultation did proposia,
we believe existing legislation may be slightly inadequate, but covers
the footpath to the door, as well as open public space. There was
very little support in the result of the consultation for actually
extending the legislation inside the door, into somebody's private
property. That, as I intimated earlier, is sadly where a lot of
the ayes happen.   the attacks haps happen.
