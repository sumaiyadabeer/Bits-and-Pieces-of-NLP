'I'm 40 years old and maybe as you get older you do tend to look back,
'you do tend to wonder where you came from.'
It's intriguing to think, "Is this that I think of
"as totally me actually the sum total of all these other mystery people
"that came before me?"
Kate Humble lives in the Wye Valley, on the border between England and Wales.
A self confessed outdoors type, she's forged a successful television career
as an adventurous, energetic and nature loving presenter.
Good morning.
I think the thing that kind of concerns me the most is that I'll discover that I've had
an ancestor that's done something really extraordinary   dragged themselves from abject poverty
and become a success, or that have done something almost superhuman.
Come on, then!
I think I'd feel that somehow
and join the ambulance service or become a paramedic or something to make up for it.
'I literally have no idea what lies ahead.
'It is an adventure. I love adventures, and this is going to be one.
'Probably the biggest journey of discovery I've ever done.'
'All my grandparents are dead now, but both my grandfathers   they were both really into flying.
'Mum's father was in the RAF during the war,
'and Dad's father, Bill, was a test pilot.'
It's one of those phrases that has been trotted out throughout my life.
You know, "Your grandfather was a Hawker jet test pilot."
So you go, "Oh, yeah, my grandfather was a Hawker jet test pilot."
I don't actually know what that means.
I don't know the significance, really, of what he did,
and I never thought to ask.
And I think somehow, even if it's your own family,
it's quite private. And my family are quite a private family.
You know, we don't talk about troubles and strife
and what went on before.
So, the first part of this journey of discovery...
I guess I'll have to go and see my parents.
'I phoned home to tell them I was coming and Mum said that Dad thought it would be a good idea,
'cos it's a beautiful day, to meet in the pub down the road.'
The thing I remember about Gramps Bill
was that everyone thought of him as a bit of a rogue.
That he was someone who kind of bordered on the glamorous,
but possibly not always the good glamorous,
but the slightly kind of disreputable glamorous.
And that he'd been a test pilot, and that's embarrassingly really all I know about him.
I think you're right about the slightly shady... slightly shady glamour.
So, I've got some stuff we'll go through.
That's the... That's his obituary.
  That'll tell you quite a lot about him.
  Oh, wow.
He learned to fly when he was about 17 or 18, when he was quite young.
  Look, demonstration flying.
  Yeah.
  I didn't know he did that.
  Oh, yeah.
It says here, "Bill Humble will also be remembered as being one
"of the finest exponents of display flying of his time."
So he did all he kind of loop the loop sort of stuff?
  He did all that.
  That's a great picture, isn't it? He's so vain, even then.
  He's sort of turning round and going...
  Looking at the camera.
It's like Dick Dastardly, isn't it? All he needs is Mutley in the back.
It became an absolute passion.
He had a string of his own aircraft, which he flew in races, he flew in sort of meets.
It was a big thing before the war. And when the war began,
Bill became the chief test pilot for Hawker Siddeley and stayed with them for the rest of his working career.
But Bill qualified as a mining engineer.
Now, that's your great grandfather, Bill's father, William Horsley Humble.
  Right.
  And he finished up owning most of the company that owned the South Yorkshire coalfield.
Wow. So, my great grandfather owned the South Yorkshire coalfields?
He owned the company that owned the South Yorkshire coalfield.
But I don't think there was any previous connection with mining.
  As far as I know, that arose quite separately.
  I mean, I love this bit at the end.
"Bill says that when things went wrong, all was passed off as a 'dicey do'".
I have to say, he spoke, at times, a bit like a cartoon character from that period. Yeah, that was him.
That was Bill Humble.
That's fascinating, to find out about Bill and the idea that he actually had his own planes.
But that he had those planes because of his father's hard work
in the mining industry, and yet, he chose to turn his back on it and just stick with flying.
And I love the idea that he was a demonstration pilot.
That he was one of those people at the Farnborough Air Show, chucking planes around the sky.
'Nearly half a million people saw the 15th Air Pageant at Hendon.
'Formation and stunt flying that makes a suicide club look like a nursery.'
During the pioneering years of aviation, air shows and air displays became hugely popular in Britain.
Wealthy men and women attempted to out perform each other with ever more daring stunts.
It was a dangerous pastime that attracted huge crowds at airfields all over the country.
The pilots became major celebrities, and Bill Humble was one of them.
Kate is at the Royal Air Force Museum in North London
with Captain Eric Brown, a former test pilot who knew Bill Humble well.
He's taking her to meet one of the curators at the museum, Ian Thirsk.
Kate, Eric, I'd love to show you a film with Bill Humble that was taken during the...
  You've got film of him?
  We have a film of him, yeah.
Come this way and we'll show you.
  Of what era? When he was a...
  It was taken in about 1936. If you'd like to sit there, Eric.
  Right, thank you.
  This is about four years before he started in test pilot work.
  Here we go.
  W Humble.
  Can you see the name? Flying Officer W Humble.
  Should see someone you recognise very soon.
  There he is.
  There he is!
That's the man himself.
How amazing! "Humble takes a bow"!
  What is he doing?
  He was... He was quite a character.
What is he wearing? It looks like half a bear!
He's tripped over his feet, yeah.
  Lots of glamorous women.
  Absolutely. There he is.
There he is. Oh, gosh. He is handsome. Actually, he looks so like my dad.
Clearly, you can just see from this, he obviously loved flying, he loved he whole environment of flying.
But was he a good pilot? Was he a skilful pilot?
Well, in life, you have trained pilots and you have natural pilots.
  Naturals are few and far between. Bill was a natural.
  Really?
  This man was extraordinary.
  Oh my goodness!
  Ah, that would be him.
  He's a maniac!
  He was a good aerobatic pilot.
He does strike me that here he is, in a great pride of lions.
Do you think he would have been the one with the biggest mane?
I do indeed, and the lionesses would have been after him!
  There's some photographs here of him as well.
  Gosh, I can't believe my...
  You know, this is my granddad!
  Yeah, there he is, look.
  Without flying helmet.
  Without flying helmet, without goggles and at some ridiculously rakish angle.
Why he was so amazing was he was actually trained as a mining engineer.
  I've always been aware of him ever since I've been interested in aviation.
  Really?
I hadn't connected that you were obviously related to him.
He made a tremendous contribution to the development of one of the most significant fighter airplanes
to be developed during the war.
With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939,
the development of faster and more powerful fighter planes became vitally important.
Expert pilots were needed to test the new planes.
Their job was to put each prototype through combat conditions and eliminate potentially fatal flaws.
Manufacturers like Hawkers turned to the big names of the air display circuit, including Bill Humble.
Bill worked for Hawker, and this was one of their greats   the Hawker Tempest.
It was one of Bill's favourites, and almost every fighter pilot's favourite.
What made it so great for a fighter pilot?
  Because it had tremendous speed.
  Right.
It looked so beautiful. It was rather like a Ferrari in the sky.
  Oh, really?
  And when you look at this,
  it really is beautiful, and yet, was very lethal.
  Right.
For a German, this was a frightening sight.
It also looks very awe inspiring, it's very imposing plane, isn't it?
When it first appeared... Here, of course, you have Bill actually in the aircraft.
That's my grandfather?
That's your grandfather. Yes, that's him.
And typically, without helmet, without goggles. But that's Bill.
  Wow, that's him!
  Yes.
  He managed to get his photograph everywhere!
  Oh, he was very...
  Look, he's even managing to smile.
  He was very photogenic, let me tell you.
I mean, presumably, his work, your work, was extremely dangerous indeed, was it?
The casualty rate of test pilots at that time was very high indeed.
So, he's putting his life inevitably on the line every time.
That wouldn't have troubled him. He accepted it as part of the job.
The demand for new planes meant
that Britain's test pilots were constantly flying untried prototypes.
It was a dangerous business and any malfunction could end in disaster.
During the war, one in four test pilots was killed.
Bill Humble was flying prototypes of the Typhoon, Fury and Hurricane.
But he will forever be associated with a plane
that became the fastest and most powerful fighter in the world.
The Tempest.
In the summer of 1944, Hitler's vengeance weapon, the V1 Doodlebug,
terrorised the people of London and the south east.
With its amazing speed, the new Tempest was the only plane capable of catching the missiles.
In just three months, they shot down a staggering 638 V1s.
Thanks to test pilots like Bill Humble, the Tempest saved thousands of lives.
One of the things that I was worried about was whether I would find out that an ancestor had done something
that was so extraordinary that I could never live up to them.
And first one   I can never live up to that, you know, what he did.
At the end of their visit, Eric has a surprise for Kate.
I've got something for you before you go.
  A recording here, made by Bill himself.
  No!
And you will enjoy it, because it is literally his whole adult life.
And I think you'll really love it.
You've made me very proud of him. You've made me realise what an important man he was.
Kate, it was a pleasure.
'I remember the film of Clark Gable in Test Pilot, and they seemed to have a fairly good time in life
'and got all the girls, drank themselves into a frenzy.
'But I'm actually a mining engineer. I'm a sort of coal miner.
'And they said, "Right, well, you're a test pilot," and so I said, "Fine thank you very much."
'I said, "All right. I'm ready for a Hurricane," which they gave me. Anyway, I got away with it.
'I didn't crash it or anything.
'The Tempest was an absolute lady.
'It was the sort of girl you could take to the vicar's tea party and she'd never put foot wrong.
'The Fury was a very attractive little aeroplane.
'If you took HER to the vicar's tea party, she'd have your gaiters off in five minutes.
'But still, it was all life and it was great fun.'
In a funny sort of way, he's ceased just to be my grandfather.
He's become a larger than life figure in his own right.
This extraordinary man.
And it happens that I'm related to him,
but I don't just see him as a relation any more, I suppose.
I see this man who had an extraordinary life and a very, very funny turn of phrase.
And he's brilliant.
And, of course, I want him to be alive now so I can tell him.
Well, I feel...frustrated more than anything.
I feel ashamed of myself
that...that I....
that I haven't made more of an effort to...
to find out about him.
You know, I feel I should have done.
You know, meeting people today at the museum,
going, "Wow, you're related to Bill Humble,"
and I don't kind of feel like I deserve to be,
cos I never bothered to...find out... what an amazing person he was.
What he was doing was really meaningful,
and that's...that's a proper legacy.
Bill Humble pursued his passion for flying, rather than follow his father into the coal industry.
But how far back in Kate's family does coal mining go?
So what I've done is, I've sent off for William Horsley's birth certificate,
and I'm gonna use this to go back to sort of see what his ancestors were doing,
and whether coal was something that featured in their lives,
or whether there's any indication that there was wealth before William.
Let's have a look. Here he is, William Horsley,
born 14th November 1874, Pemberton Colliery.
Father Joseph Humble, mother Mary Ann Humble, formerly Banks.
A ha. So, if I go onto the census...
Spouse...Mary...Ann.
This is kind of really what the internet's for, isn't it?
It's astonishing stuff.
Oh!
This is amazing.
Joseph Humble, born 1844, birthplace Earsdon, Northumberland.
Occupation...underground...hewer?
Hewer. Underground hewer.
Maybe we can find out about his father,
my great, great, great grandfather.
1861, England.
Ooh, here we go. Oh, brilliant.
There he is, at the top.
So, Joseph Humble senior,
and his profession is... colliery hewer.
So, Dad was wrong there.
Clearly, coal obviously was in the family.
So, I need to find out what a hewer is.
I think I need to go north.
Kate has confirmed that her family on her father's side were connected to the coal industry.
William Horsley Humble's involvement in coal mining follows on from his father, Joseph,
and his grandfather, also called Joseph.
According to the census, Joseph senior worked in the mines in Northumberland.
Kate has come to Woodhorne, a former colliery and now a major mining museum near Newcastle.
It holds the archives and records from the Northumberland coalfields.
Coal mining in Victorian England was an extremely hard and dangerous occupation.
Entire families, children included, worked in the industry.
At the height of the industrial revolution, one in every five men worked in coal mining.
It was an industry that was expanding rapidly, and the safety of the miners was largely overlooked.
Right. Get my coat off. I can feel serious business coming on.
Kate is meeting local historian Catherine Pringle.
  This is the census.
  What is a colliery hewer?
Well, actually, on this census, Joseph senior's occupation was actually wrong.
  He was, in fact, a colliery viewer.
  So, what does that mean?
Right! Colliery viewer was, in fact, in charge of the pit.
He was the day to day running sort of organiser, he was the manager.
  Very responsible role.
  So, quite senior, then?
  Yeah. They've actually found a photograph of Joseph.
  No way!
Yeah. He's tucked away in the corner there.
I'm trying to see if there's a family likeness. There's sort of...
He's not dissimilar to Bill,
  that quite sort of strong lower jaw, and quite dark.
  Yeah.
Looks like something out of Dickens, doesn't it?
Little bit of a baddie, actually!
  What an amazing picture.
  Yeah.
We've been doing some research,
and I've actually found Joseph senior again in the 1871 census,
and this time, he was actually living in Ryhope in Durham.
And you'll see that his occupation has changed.
  Something and...grocer and draper?
  Yeah.
  How weird. So, he'd moved away from the pits altogether.
  Yeah, entirely.
Why would he have moved away, because his son had taken over?
No, there was quite a major event that actually changed his life,
and eventually, changed his career as well.
  Could I ask you to put the gloves on?
  Yeah.
Ooh, I've got sort of...goosebumps.
Yeah! Now, there's a few articles.
  So this is actually the Daily Chronicle and Northern Counties Advertiser.
  Right.
"Appalling colliery accident at Hartley.
"Even while we write, nearly 200 miners may be struggling
"among subterranean waters, 100 fathoms beneath the Earth's surface,
"anxiously waiting for deliverance which may never reach them."
God, how awful.
What's actually happened is that the main beam of the pumping engine
used in the pit has snapped, which weighed an absolute ton,
and it's gone down the pit, and so therefore, they're stuck down there until they can be rescued.
So effectively, these bodies that he's describing have been buried alive?
Yeah. Including children.
The giant beam from the pump engine blocked the pit's single shaft.
There was no escape for the 204 miners trapped 600 feet below.
Now, Joseph and the other rescuers faced the gruesome task of reaching the trapped men.
There's now a reference to Mr Humble and Mr Hall.
"Viewers who had been lowered into the pit have been drawn to bank in an extremely exhausted condition."
  That means they've been brought back up again, doesn't it?
  Yeah.
"Mr Hall was suffering severely from the effects of gas, and Mr Humble was also much affected."
It's insane to go down into it, really, but I suppose a viewer would have to.
  That would be their responsibility.
  Absolutely.
"On recovering consciousness, Mr Humble, whose fortitude seems to have been overcome
"by this last, sad blow, exclaimed, 'Oh, my canny men, oh, my canny men!'"
It's terrible.
What a horrible position for him to be in.
It's a terrible thing that happened.
"They would do aught for me. I hope they are happy." God.
  You could never recover from that, could you?
  No, it's something you wouldn't get over.
"It was evident from the condition of Mr Humble and Mr Hall
"that the descent into the dark regions of death was a work of danger,
"the air being foul and charged with noxious gas."
Oh, what a terrible thing to happen.
All those people dying,
and my great, great, great grandfather
was one of the overseers of that pit.
I've got this horrible, niggling feeling that...
you know, that somehow,
Joseph Humble might have been able to prevent it happening.
Sounds like he probably had that niggling feeling too,
the description of his desperate grief.
He must have thought, was there something
that he could have done to prevent it happening?
And I suppose that's the next rather gruesome stage of my journey,
to find out why it happened, what actually happened,
and whether he was responsible.
To find out more about what happened on the day of the disaster,
Kate has come to the Ryhope engines museum near Sunderland.
They have a working beam engine almost identical to the one
that caused the deaths of the men in the Hartley pit.
Dr Stafford Lindsley is a local expert on the Hartley pit disaster.
Gosh, the sheer scale
and yet, the kind of delicacy of the engineering is staggering, isn't it?
And so, what I read in that newspaper report about half the beam falling
down the shaft, that would be, say,
from that middle section to the end, tumbled down?
It fractured more or less through there.
And nothing like that had ever happened before.
Can I use a diagram?
By all means, you can.
This was the situation at Hartley.
  Here's the main shaft.
  Right.
Twelve and a half feet diameter.
Now, when the beam broke in two,
the beam came down the shaft, caused damage to the walls of the shaft,
and the shaft itself was blocked by all the debris,
which meant there was no ventilation.
Over a period of a couple of days, 200 people further down, they slowly died.
Hartley was not unusual in having just one main shaft.
If it had had two shafts, or if that step between the bottom two seams
had been extended to the highest seam,
in all probability, 200 people would have been saved.
  All that loss of life. Oh!
  Yeah.
'Joseph must have felt that there was something he could have done to prevent what happened.
'Why else would he have left to go and be a grocer?
'Why else would he stop doing what was his life?'
In Newcastle, Kate visits the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers,
to find out what happened in the aftermath of the disaster.
There's an illustration here of the broken beam.
Oh...
"A personal narrative of the appalling catastrophe at Hartley Pit."
Right, let's see.
"The men who were bringing up the bodies went down in shifts,
"but so few could be got to undertake this most repulsive task,
"that those who did consent to do so
"were compelled to remain at their posts
"much longer than was good for them.
"Pile after pile of coffins has been filled and borne away."
Oh, listen to this.
"We were standing tonight by the side of Mr Humble,
"the energetic and devoted under viewer,
"who has never, since the accident, deserted his trying post."
"Internment of the pit men in a plot of ground near Earsdon Church."
Just mass graves.
There's names of everyone who was killed.
"Glen, William, boy, Glen, George, boy."
There was a Joseph Humble.
"Married, nephew of the under viewer."
So, my Joseph lost his nephew.
So, this is the inquest.
Let's see if there's a verdict.
Here we are.
"The jury cannot close this painful enquiry
"without expressing their strong opinion of the imperative necessity
"that all working collieries should have, at least, a second shaft
"or outlet to afford the workmen the means of escape.
"They also take occasion to notice with admiration
"the heroic courage of the viewers...
"and others, who, at the risk of their own lives
"for so many nights and days, devoted their best skill and energies...
"..to rescue the unfortunate men who were lost.
"And everything that human ingenuity could accomplish
"was done towards this humane object."
So, the jury recognised that the viewers,
Joseph and the others, weren't responsible at all.
Oh!
The jury of the official inquest into the Hartley pit disaster concluded that no individual
was to blame and that it was a tragic and unavoidable accident.
The Hartley pit disaster changed mining in Britain forever.
New rules meant that in future,
all mines would have to have at least two shafts.
There's one last stop on this part of Kate's journey  
St Alban's church in Earsdon,
where the miners killed at Hartley pit were laid to rest.
It says, "Erected to the memory of the 204 miners
"who lost their lives in Hartley pit."
and you can see all the names grouped together by family, presumably.
There are teenagers up there.
I mean, if you were a member of the Liddle family,
they lost nine, aged from 11 to 40.
Desperate.
And then, down at the bottom, there's Joseph Humble,
the nephew of my great, great, great grandfather,
who died aged 27.
I had no idea I had any connection to Northumberland.
And they lived up to their name, these men.
The Humbles belonged in the pits, that's what they did,
and they were clearly hard working, working class, North Eastern men
who had coal running through their veins.
And Joseph senior, to see his men, his canny men, perish, is unimaginable.
'Reading those accounts of how caring he was,
'how he stood at the pit head and he wouldn't move
'until he found out what had happened to those men.'
And every single account I read said that he was a good man.
He was a good, brave, honest,
heartbroken man.
And I think it's terribly, terribly sad
that he couldn't stay in mining, but who could, after that?
I'm kind of exhausted and I'm only half way through.
As I say, hope I don't have to cry too much more,
cos I'm running out of tissues!
'I'm off to my parents' house now,
'because after the emotional rollercoaster of finding out about Dad's side of the family,
'I now need to start with Mum's side,
'and hopefully, get a bit more information from her
'about my grandfather, who was in the RAF.'
Hello, hello.
We're like twins, we should have phoned and co ordinated outfits!
These are some photographs of Grandpa,
I don't know how well you remember him.
Well, I don't remember him looking like that.
  Well, that was in the war.
  I just remember him sitting by that stove
in the little cottage in Berkhamstead
with a cat and a pint, and a tin of rolling tobacco.
So, did he train to be a pilot for the war?
No, no, no, he sailed to Australia.
And he worked on a sheep station in Queensland.
  Wow!
  But anyway, he came back when war was imminent and enlisted then,
and it was at the beginning of the war he met my mother.
  Right.
  And they had a very quick sort of wartime romance, as people tended to do, and married.
  And then...
  When you say "quick"...
Maybe three or four months,
and then, his plane was shot down over Germany,
I think they must have been married about six or seven months,
and then, she didn't see him for three years.
And then, when he finally came back, they didn't recognise each other.
  They hadn't known each other for very long.
  Wow!
But these are his log books, which I must say, I haven't read since I was a teenager,
  and not very thoroughly then.
  So, we've got 12th June '41.
He's a rear gunner twice and bombing Cologne.
Then he was a navigator.
Then on 30th June, he was a rear gunner bombing Dusseldorf,
someone completely different writing.
  Says "missing".
  And that was where he was shot down.
Did anyone know where he was or was he missing?
My mother thought he was missing and presumed dead for a long time,
and then, she had news that he was in a prison camp.
But he was a notorious escaper.
He escaped just about everywhere that they put him,
  and there's a letter here that my cousin sent me.
  Right.
And he writes here about how he was in various camps and things.
"He was shot down several times, but parachuted safely and escaped.
"Eventually, however, he was taken prisoner and sent to Stanley..."
  Stalag Luft.
  "Stalag Luft III.
"Better known as Colditz." Crikey!
So, he finally ended up in Colditz.
He spent the whole war in prisoner of war camps.
Most of it, most of it. This is his...
"A Wartime Log for British Prisoners."
I can't really work out...it just seems to be a list of names of people who were in the camp.
And did he talk about stuff with you?
No, he didn't. Very little, he was of a generation who just didn't talk about themselves.
And certainly didn't talk about the war. You know, people just didn't do it.
If Kate's grandfather Stan was a prisoner of war in Colditz,
his records should be held at the National Archives.
Kate's enlisted the help of archivist William Spencer.
When POWs were repatriated, they were asked to compile a report,
so we can actually look for a POW,
a repatriation report relating to the individual.
Do you have one for Stan Carter?
  Well, let's see what we have before us.
  Right.
That his name, and you'll see they're in alphabetical order.
So if I turn to his report of...
There he is, Stanley Carter.
Flight Lieutenant Stanley Carter.
  Now, one of your questions was whether it mentioned Colditz?
  Yeah.
Now, Colditz doesn't come into the list,
  but then, eventually, he goes to Stalag Luft III.
  Yeah.
  At Sagan.
  Yeah. Yeah.
  But it's not Colditz.
  Right.
He definitely wasn't in Colditz?
  That was just confusion on my family's part?
  Yes, certainly.
But Stalag Luft III was the bad boys' camp. The habitual escapers went there.
But perhaps the most important thing is what it's famous for.
Stalag Luft III is the home of The Great Escape.
What, the film, The Great Escape? The Steve McQueen film?
  The Steve McQueen film where you have Steve McQueen leaping over the barbed wire.
  Wow!
'These men dared, these men lived...
'The Great Escape.'
This is a new camp, it has been built to hold you and your men.
We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket.
There will be no escapes from this camp.
The Great Escape was a Hollywood blockbuster.
It told the story of the audacious attempt to break out of Stalag Luft III.
For nearly a year, the prisoners dug a tunnel from Hut 104
that stretched over 300 feet beyond the perimeter fence.
The incredible plan was for 200 men to crawl through the tunnel
to the woods beyond the wire and to freedom.
The Great Escape occurred on 24th March 1944.
So, Stanley Carter...
  Yeah.
  ..was in Stalag Luft III at the time of The Great Escape.
Was he involved in it?
We can find out a little bit more.
We have Liberation Report 948.
And it gives the name of Flight Lieutenant S Carter, 83 Squadron.
"I was attached to the escape committee at Stalag Luft III,
"organised by Squadron Leader R Bushell, Royal Air Force."
That's the character that was played by Lord Attenborough.
  "I was map drawing most of that period and identifying any aircraft that flew over the camp."
  Right.
The important thing about escape
was for the prisoners to have the right amount of information
which meant they could get from their prison camp
to a point of safety. So, maps were very, very, important.
And I think Stanley Carter made a contribution
to the most important, significant POW escape
in British Military history in the Second World War.
How amazing! Clever old Stan.
Yet again I found another relation who has done something amazing.
  There's your card.
  Thanks very much.
I watched The Great Escape last night and,
apart from shouting at the telly cos there wasn't someone called Stan in it,
it just reminded me of what those men achieved.
Of course what I'm dying to know
is whether Stan could have been one of those men waiting to escape that night.
So that's why I've got to go to Poland.
There were over 300 POW camps spread across Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Poland.
The largest group of prisoners were airman shot down on bombing missions.
They were held in special camps exclusively for air crew.
Stanley's camp Stalag Luft III was specifically designed by the Germans to make tunnelling impossible.
The camp was built on loose sandy soil,
the huts were raised off the ground and they even installed microphones
in the soil to pick up the sound of digging.
Stalag Luft III was on the outskirts of Zagan, a small town in south west Poland.
Today, most of the site has been reclaimed by dense forest
and very little remains of the once vast complex.
  Howard!
  Kate, lovely to meet you. Let me show you the camp.
  Let's wander off and have a look.
  Brilliant.
Kate's here to meet POW historian, Howard Tuck.
This was an enormous camp.
  And the huts would have stretched as far as the eye could see.
  Wow.
They put all the escapers here who had a history of digging tunnels.
The moles of the escaping world. It does sound loony doesn't it?
  Spread them out at least!
  Well, you'd think so now.
  Yeah.
Actually what they did was design a camp here whereby they thought they could give them facilities
such as a theatre and their reading club and even a university behind the wire that was in here.
What they thought is that the prisoners of war would settle down and stop their escaping activities.
  And was the film right that they built three tunnels from three separate huts?
  Yes, they did.
  The idea was to spring over 200 officers out of this camp so it was an incredibly audacious plan.
  Yeah.
A very complex plan and it demanded three different tunnels, Tom, Dick and Harry.
  The other two were found by the Germans.
  Yeah.
So, Harry became the tunnel that was gonna be used on the escape.
This is inside the hut, now.
  This is the famous Barrack 104.
  This is the kind of trap door.
This is it. This is the very place where actually on the night of 24th March 1944, the Great Escapers,
those famous men they all assembled in this hut and try and imagine the atmosphere in here that night.
There were 200 of them crammed in here all in their replica German uniforms they'd all had made.
The forgers had made their papers, they're already to go.
Some of them are dressed as business men.
They assemble in here they go down the shaft where we are,
30 feet down a ladder and there it is, the tunnel.
They got a railway down there, they got a workshop down there, it had electric lighting.
  Staggering!
  Yeah.
  It's staggering!
Yes, it's the stuff of a war movie, of course.
You saw in the film that they nicked the bed slats from their beds
to shore up the tunnel so it wouldn't collapse.
They did and if you speak to the prisoners of war within this camp they still remember,
fairly bitterly some of them, that they'd jump onto the bunk
and there'd be no slats on the bunk.
It was the ingenuity of this that really marks out The Great Escape.
  Now, you said that there were 200 men crammed in that hut waiting to go down this tunnel.
  Yeah.
Stanley Carter, my grandfather on the records in the archive
he described himself as someone who drew maps for the Great Escape
but do you think that would have qualified him to be one of the 200 in the hut?
  I would suggest he probably was. We can't prove it for certain.
  No.
Cos after a certain number it starts getting vague as to who
  was actually down the tunnel and who was ready to go.
  Yeah.
It sounds to me there's a very good chance he could've been in the hut that night, waiting to go.
Of the 200 men huddled in the hut, 76 made it through the tunnel
and into the woods before the German guards discovered the escape.
Battling snow and icy conditions only three of the men made it to safety.
23 were returned to captivity.
On the direct orders of Adolf Hitler,
the remaining 50 prisoners...
..were executed.
At the site of Stalag Luft III, there's now a museum dedicated to the memory of the prisoners of war.
  I haven't shown you this have I?
  No.
  This is Stanley.
My mum gave me that photograph.
  Obviously not in the camp.
  Yeah.
  That's a great shot.
  It is. I don't know whether it's pre or post war.
  It is post war because he's got the defence medal up there.
  Right.
But, interestingly, he's a Squadron Leader. That's a decent rank to get to.
  Is it?
  Yeah, it is. Especially for an air gunner.
  It's great to see.
  One thing is...he's quite handsome.
  Oh, yeah.
The other thing that I wanted to ask you, cos this is his log,
There's a couple of things I don't understand. One is this entry at the back
and it says cheques... as in writing cheques.
  Can I take a look at it?
  Yeah.
This is incredible.
I mean genuinely this is remarkable.
You might have unlocked a secret here...from the POW camps.
At the end of the Great Escape, all the affects, gold watches,
  you know, pocket watches, personal artefacts of those shot on the escape...
  Yeah.
  ..Remained in the lockers in the camp.
  Yeah.
They held an auction to stop the Germans getting hold of these effects
and then at the end of the war promised to give a cheque to the family.
  It says here Flight Lieutenant Culverwell, £3.
  Yeah.
  And it says...
  Is it "contribution"?
"Contribution to dependant of killed POW's".
Stanley could have been the chap who was looking after the effects of the Great Escapers.
This is filling a part of the story for us we've just not had.
Honestly, this is gold dust, it really is. It's fantastic.
Wow! The other thing that I wanted to ask you...
This "log of march" and it starts on Sunday 28th January 1945.
Well, this is the long march.
A real hidden part, Kate, of RAF history that you don't hear many people talk about.
Hitler had issued a Fuhrer order the year before that said when the Red Army,
that was coming from the East, towards Berlin, if it came across these prisoners of war camps
they were to be marched to the North, towards Berlin, Hanover places like that.
And that's what happened. They were roused in the middle of the night and I can just see in here...
Yeah, he says, given I think it's, "One hour notice to be ready to march at 2300 hours."
This is so rare, honestly.
And I've got some photographs to show you. These are photographs of the march itself.
These were taken with clandestine cameras, many of which were made in the camp itself.
Look at that, that's a sledge that was made out of bed boards.
  Yeah.
  And you can see the snow,
  you can see the fact that...
  And just look how exhausted, that dead eye look isn't it?
  Yeah. Yeah.
  The look of desperation.
  Yeah.
  The look of, "We don't know where we're going,
"we don't know what we're going to" and Stanley was there.
The reality of seeing where the camp was made it much more real.
But most importantly seeing where the tunnel was, IS, I mean, it's still there underneath,
really gave a sense of... This isn't just something that was on a Hollywood movie   this was real.
This was something that men really, truly were involved in including my grandfather.
And then to find out about this march the way that they left the camp.
It's kind of hard to imagine really what that journey was like.
So I think what I need to do now is...
I'm not gonna march it, but at least drive it and try and get into my mind the distances covered.
And maybe see if there are any other landmarks that he refers to in his diary along the way.
As Stanley Carter and the other prisoners of Stalag Luft III
were marched away from the advancing Russian army,
prison camps all over Germany were being evacuated.
In the first few months of 1945, over 200,000 allied prisoners walked
hundreds of miles westward across Poland, Czechoslovakia and Germany.
In one of the worst winters on record, temperatures plummeted towards minus 20,
as the men were forced to march up to 30 kilometres as day.
"Sledges discarded after five to six kilometres,
"north west wind, very cold,
"no fuel, hence no brew, no water even if we had any brew which we haven't.
"Horse flesh and mangle wurzel soup with large pieces of wind pipe floating in it."
"Stood on the road again for three hours whilst the Germans took account in a blinding blizzard."
"Developed muscular rheumatism in my legs."
"No water."
Stan's diary tells how the sick and exhausted men were forced to march through blizzard conditions.
They spent one night at this farm in Leippa.
The museum at Stalag Luft III has arranged for Kate to meet Frank Stone,
a former POW who was with Stanley on the march.
It's a sort of magnificent old complex this,
but presumably the memories for you are less magnificent?
Yes, well it was pitch black when we arrived so we didn't know what it was looking like.
  So, I've got Stanley's log of the march here.
  Yes.
  Arrived in Hal...
  Halbau.
  Halbau.
At 1100 hours he continued the march to Leippa so to here.
  That was here, yes, yes.
  "Stood on the open road for four hours"!
And Stanley describes it as being "extremely cold wind and snow".
  And as a result there were numerous cases of frost bite.
  Yeah.
My toe on my right foot, big toe froze.
Really? I mean did it go black?
  Yes, yes.
  Oh, Frank.
  I still get trouble with it.
  "Only accommodation," he says "in one barn which was totally inadequate for 2,000 people".
  Yeah.
Well, he said, "we managed to bribe the farmer with cigs and a D bar."
  What's a D bar?
  That was the American chocolate in the K rations.
He said they bribed the farmer with cigs and a D bar,
"to let us sleep in the cow shed. Very smelly but warm."
  Well, that, that...
  Well, that was that one.
  Yes.
  So that means that Stanley must have been in that one.
  That one, yes.
  Gosh, how amazing.
  That would be it.
And we hadn't eaten for over 12 hours then.
So, you literally just walked through these freezing conditions with no food?
No. No, no help from the Germans whatsoever except to keep marching.
  And they didn't know where we were going.
  They didn't know where you were going?
I mean, it were just automatons, you know, sort of trudging along one foot in front of the other.
That's all you could do, that's how it felt.
  Oh.
  And the lowest, absolutely lowest point of my life.
  Oh, Frank.
  And everybody was the same.
I mean, there was no, no exception.
But did you fear that because you were in German hands that they might try and use you in some sort of...
Well, that was it. We were the hostages.
That's why they kept us on the march, well,
they wouldn't leave us at Zagan because the Russians were within 10 kilometres.
So they wanted to use you?
Yes, and they did that right through until May '45.
  Do you know I nearly broke down in tears when I walked in here?
  I'm not surprised.
Because, as I say it was such a low point in my life and I thought, "God, how did I recover from that?"
Well, I feel incredibly inadequate you know, our generation
has had such an easy time of life, thanks to all of you, I mean...
We did our best.
You did more than that. You did more than that.
Stanley and other POWs were marched even further Westward to Spremberg
where they were crammed onto railway trucks.
The Russians were advancing at speed from the east
whilst the British and Americans were closing in from the west.
Sick, exhausted and close to death, the prisoners were transported
500 kilometres north to the small town of Tarmstadt.
In desperate retreat, the Germans used the POWs as human shields
herding them off the trains and forcing them to march yet again.
"It was a rainy, cold day. Attacked by allied aircraft,
"slept in fields a lot.
"Ate very little.
"Our fate in the balance."
As Stan's diary catalogued their horrific journey,
the situation for the Germans was rapidly descending into chaos.
With the German high command virtually destroyed and the allies tightening the noose,
the Germans had no option but to head for one of the few remaining unoccupied German cities...Lubeck.
After marching a gruelling 800 kilometres,
Stan and the men arrived in Lubeck.
Just days later, British soldiers marched in and took the city without a fight.
To find out what happened here, Kate's meeting local historian Christian Rathmer.
On 24th April, he says that, "Our fate is in the balance, re going to Lubeck,
"hear typhus has broken out there".
Oh, yes, the whole situation in Lubeck at the end of the war was chaotical.
You have to imagine that thousands of refugees came into the town.
As well as the POWs?
Yes, and I think the British troops also were very surprised that the Germans not offered any resistance.
  Nothing at all.
  Nothing.
  Really, they just, they just came in...
  Yes.
  ..Almost as if the Germans had opened the city gates and said, "Come and just end this thing now".
That is possible.
I have some photographs here.
This is the famous town gate, the Holsten Tower.
  Wow, look at that.
  Can you see the first tanks of the British Army?
  And that's a British tank?
  That's a British tank, yes.
And you'll see on the other side, inside the town the thousands of German prisoners now.
  And this one here?
  Ah, this one is a photo of British planes.
So this is a Lancaster Bomber?
They used them to repatriate the British former prisoners to the United Kingdom.
Look at those man don't they look happy?
  One of them could be your grandfather.
  Yeah.
With the war in Europe over, so began the massive task of getting the POWs home.
Lancaster bombers flew from Lubeck and airfields across northern Europe.
In just 23 days, Operation Exodus brought home 74,000 former prisoners of war.
Among them was Kate's Grandfather, Stanley Carter.
So, Stan was finally repatriated and the very last entry in his diary reads,
"Arrive Dunscombe, Surrey. Reception piss poor."
"Southern Railway to Waterloo onto Ensley.
"Hotel very crummy, meal consisted of one egg and a spoonful of potatoes.
"Left at 2330 hours via Euston to Wolverhampton to Cosford, changed at Watford."
So that was it. Stan was back in real life,
back with the wife that he'd known for a few months
and back to meet the four and a half year old girl, my mum, his daughter for the very first time.
This man that I scarcely remember really,
now has become much more real to me.
He was clearly a man who relished freedom.
When I started this journey, I had absolutely no idea
that I would get so wrapped up, emotionally wrapped up, in the stories of three dead men.
All of them had a tremendous sense of loyalty and of duty
and they all showed tremendous courage.
And it's kind of ironic that, right at the beginning of this,
I said, "I hope I don't discover I have ancestors that I couldn't live up to."
And now I hope... Well, I hope that I go through life never being tested in the way that those three did.
But if I am and I have inherited just a shred of that loyalty
and a shred of that bravery, then I should be OK.
