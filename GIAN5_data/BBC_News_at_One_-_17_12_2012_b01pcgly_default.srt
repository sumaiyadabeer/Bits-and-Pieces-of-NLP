Welcome to the BBC News. President Obama says he will use whatever
powers he has to try and prevent further tragedies, following the
mass shooting at a school in Connecticut. Mr Obama told a multi 
 fate vigil in Newtown that the country had to change. 20 children
on himself. The first funeral of one of the victims will take place
later today. Our correspondent reports.
A moment for Newtown to come together, after the horror and the
heart break. An interfaith prayer vigil for the dead. In his role as
the nation's comforter in chief, the President offered this
assurance. I come to offer the love and prayers of the nation. I am
very mindful that words can not match the depths of your sorrow,
nor can they heal your wounded hearts.
I can only hope it helps for you to know you're not alone.
President praised the teachers who died trying to protect their
charges. As families held their children tightly, he said mass
shootings couldn't be tolerated any more. We can't accept events like
this as routine. Are we really prepared to say we
are powerless? In the face of such carnage.
That the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say such violence
visited on our children, year, after year, after year are the
price of our freedom. As Newtown grieved for the 20 lost children,
Barack Obama named each one. Noah, Caroline, Jessica, Benjamin,
Avielle, Allison, God has called them all home.
Newtown is experiencing heart  rending sorrow.
Watching the President's speech, was an emotional experience for
many. His coming here is very momental.
It means a lot to everybody here. It raises a question that everybody
is thinking about. What else can we do? More should definitely be done.
There's got to be something because there's too many kids dying, too
many shootings. It doesn't belong anywhere. As this town mourns, the
President's call for meaningful action in the wake of these
killings will soon be tested. A senior Democrat will try and
introduce a law to ban assault weapons. The question is whether
the political climate has changed after this tragedy, so that such a
ban can pass. Let's pick that up now with our
correspondent, who joins us from Newtown. How much has the feeling
towards gun laws changed since what happened in Newtown? Well,
unfortunately in America they have seen mass shootings before, but I
think why this one particularly is so different is because it involves
children of such a young age and shot in such a brutal way using an
assault weapon. An assault weapon which had previously been banned by
federal law, but that law had lapsed in 2004. There is talk now
about having that reinstated. Certainly President Obama was here
last night, speaking at that memorial service and he vowed to
use all the powers of his office to make sure that something like this
never happened again. He didn't mention gun control specifically.
But there is increasing pressure for something to be done, possibly
to tighten the laws. Many States over the last few years have seen
laws against guns actually get more lenient.
Thank you. You can find out more about the
debate on gun laws in America and some profiles of some of those who
lost their lives in the Newtown shootings. It's on the BBC News
website. A further 300,000 people are likely
to have been pushed into fuel poverty by Christmas, according to
Government advisers. A household is considered to be fuel poor if more
than 10% of income is spent on Energy Bills. The big six energy
firms have all announced price rises this winter. The annual
direct debit bill per year is �1,000.
It's the perfect Christmas scene. With our energy prices up, and
winter upon us, the last thing many households will want this year is a
white Christmas. The latest figures suggest that a further 300,000
households will be pushed into fuel poverty by the latest rounds of
energy price hikes. Leaving 6.5 million households classed as fuel
poor. Some suggest the figure could go higher in the years to come.
And it is the vulnerable who suffer most. Over half of them are
pensioners. Around one third have a disability or a long term illness.
Around one fifth, or 20%, they have a child under five. With Energy
Bills already at record high levels, this report warns that the plight
of the fuel poor has never be more serious. What's more, there are now
real concerns that in the coming years our domestic Energy Bills
could go higher. Some fear that global gas prices
could be one of the main drivers. The Government's plans for low 
carbon energy will also increase our bills. Today, the energy
regulator confirmed we would all pay an extra �12 on average a year
to upgrade the electricity and gas networks. We know that people are
struggling with their bills. That is something we are very conscious
of. Our plans are designed to make sure that customers pay the minimum
for the necessary upgrades to the infrastructure.
The report calls for a step change in the energy efficiency of our
housing stock. It warns that in England help for the fuel poor will
be cut by almost half. So what can the Government do? Gas prices will
have doubled by 2007. No one can do anything about that. I am
determined to do as much as we can, whether on competition, to drive
down energy costs or whether in energy efficiency. That will not
help this Christmas, when for many, there'll be just one way to keep
bills low. The Queen is going to Downing Street tomorrow to attend a
Cabinet meeting as an observer. It is thought to be the first time a
monarch has done so since Queen Victoria's reign. She is expected
to sit next to the Prime Minister. Nick, how much is Downing Street
revealing about what is likely to happen tomorrow? Not a great deal.
It has to be said. The Queen, she has regular meetings with her Prime
Ministers. Perhaps, surprisingly, she has never attended a Cabinet
meeting. No monarch has since Queen Victoria. Tomorrow, the Queen will
come here to Downing Street. The purpose of the visit is to receive
a Diamond Jubilee gift from the Cabinet. They've had a kind of a
whip around and they are not revealing what they have raised or
what that gift is. A previous Government for a previous jubilee
bought her a silver coffee pot. She will join the Cabinet meeting, not
for the 90 minutes, be    but it is thought for 30 minutes. Downing
Street are saying she will be an observer. She's not expected to
make any contributions. Judging by the sharp questions she asked at
the Bank of England last Thursday, you never know!
Thank you. Nick Clegg has set out the differences between his party
and their coalition partners, the Conservatives. Talking about some
of the themes on which the Liberal Democrats will contest the next
election, the Deputy Prime Minister said they had rejected extreme
welfare reforms and anchored the UK in the political centre ground. Our
correspondent joins us from Westminster now.
Tomorrow, will be Nick Clegg's fifth anniversary as Lib Dem leader.
He spent half the time in Government, half in opposition. He
said he has kept the Conservatives in the centre ground of British
politics T problem is it has cost him dear in electoral support.
Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in lock step during the
first step of this Government. That is how Nick Clegg describes his
approach to date. Now that is to change and his poll ratings are
down in single figures. He said there'll be more disagreements with
David Cameron in coming months. can be a bit more relaxed and open
about the fact it is a process, a process by which decisions are
reached through deliberations, through argument, through
compromise. The party's future in Government would be in coalition,
said Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems would be those who tempered the
iedlogs of left and right. It is, at times like these, that Britain
needs a party rooted in the centre ground, which anchors the country
there. The Liberal Democrats are that
party. We're not centre ground tourists.
The centre ground is our home. The strategy had already borne
fruit. It was his presence that stopped the Conservatives from
pushing through a further �10 billion of benefits cuts. We agreed
to update them all in line with the pay raises we can afford from the
public sector from 1%. We rejected the more extreme reforms that had
been put on the table. But after 2015 15 things like the winter fuel
allowance and free TV licenses for the elderly can be cut. It is not
sustainable to somehow say that people, multi millionaire
pensioners still receive universal benefits across the board. It is
something we need to look at. was a pitch for the centre ground.
The problem is everyone else wants to be there too. Nick Clegg's
likening his new approach to the making of sausages. He wants the
public to know what goes into coalition policy and what he
insists is left out. I guess the taste test will be in the opinion
polls. Thank you. Nearly 60 MPs and peers from all parties have joined
forces to urge the Prime Minister to drop his plans to legalise same 
sex marriage in England and Wales. 35 of the parliamentarians are
Conservative MPs. They have signed an open letter in the Daily
Telegraph newspaper, warning that the Government does not have a
mandate to redefine marriage. The nurse who aparently killed herself
after she took a prank call at the hospital where the Duchess of
Cambridge was being treated has been buried. Her funeral in the
town of Shirva was attended by thousands of people, including
friends and family. Her final journey. Jacintha Saldanha's coffin
arriving at Shirva's church. Her family, joined by friends and
hundreds of well wishers, as the kas ket is taken in for the service.
This tragedy has been closely followed in India. And the media
were out in full force. It's been the wish of Jacintha Saldanha's
family that the ceremony inside remain private. So many people have
gathered here today to pay their last respects. The police have had
a very hard time controlling the crowds. This is an event that has
devastated this very close, tightly knit community. Many people
are raising questions, wondering how this could have happened in the
first place. Her final resting place is in this grave at the
Church cemetery. Mrs Saldanha's husband, who brought her body from
the UK, inspected it earlier in the day. The Church service was
proceeded by a private ceremony at the family home. Only those closest
Most families here have a loved one living and working abroad. So this
is a tragedy that has struck home. Many are asking why and what caused
Jacintha Saldanha's death? There is anger and anguish and many
unanswered questions. Our top story:
The Connecticut school shooting, President Obama says he will use

Coming up: The vulnerability of the local vicar, how some are now
considering closing their doors. On BBC London: The inquest into the
death of singer, Amy Winehouse is to be re heard. A steam train built
more than 100 years ago has travelled on the tube ahead of a
special service in January. It is a busy time of year for
parish priests. In the run up to Christmas many ensure that the
doors are open to those who need help and support. Sometimes, though,
that accessability can have dangers. Earlier in the year, the Reverend,
Reverend John Suddards was murdered in his vicarage. His death prompted
concerns about the dangers facing the clergy and their families.
Reverend John Suddards had been the vicar of St Mary's Church in
Thornberry for six months when he was attacked and murdered. He was
well aware of the potential risks that came with the collar and once
discussed the issue with a community radio station.
I think it is very important, the Church has been there for the
people of Thornberry for hundreds of years. We do have to take risks,
but we believe they are the risks we are called on to take.
Risks that just months later would cost his life. Such murders are
rare, but abuse and violence are not.
I came here, there was a big group of lads kicking a football up
against the crucifix here. A football, repeatedly doing it. I
was unnerved by that. So I came out, I grabbed the ball, went inside and
locked the doors. Father Kevin Scully was badly
beaten up at his church in East London.
I raze how close and dangerous the situation had been. How near to
real hurt, and real danger that I was. So that affected the way that
I behaved, especially, I would see groups of lads coming around, I
would lock up the church. I was anxious. I had to seek professional
help. I was unnerved and had lost my confidence.
Now, the number of these attacks can be difficult to categorise.
Academic research in the past, has named the clergy as one of the most
at risk groups of professionals working in the community. This is
the response. What would happen.if you jumped up
and tried to attack me? Where would I go? The doors are there? These
courses don't teach martial arts, the aim is to prevent situations
escalating to the point of violence, so that priests, and in this case,
their wives and husbands, are equipped to deal with the problems.
If you are aware you are on your own in that vicarage, you are
putting yourself at danger. Say "no", but give an alternative.
For many, that may feel as if it goes against the core beliefs, but
controlling the open door policy may protect them from serious harm.
A police officer has been arrested and suspended from duty on
suspicion of leaking details of the confrontation at the gates of
Downing Street between the police and the former Chief Whip, Andrew
Mitchell. Andrew Mitchell was accused of calling officers plebes
as they would not ride his bike, something that he denies.
Now let's speak with our correspondent. What more do we
know? Good afternoon. Well, Andrew Mitchell has already admitted that
he swore at the police officers who tried to stop him riding on his
bike through the main gates of Downing Street. He apologised for
that and has paid a political price, but he denies calling the officers
morons and plebes, who should know their place. These are the alleged
comments in a police log book about the event and those comments were
leaked to two national newspapers. So the issue is who leaked that
information without authorisation and Scotland Yard says that the
Metropolitan Police got a fresh tip off on Thursday about this. On
Saturday they arrested a constable with the diplomatic protection
group. He has been suspended and he has been bailed until next month. I
should make the point that this is not one of the officers on duty,
involved in the incident in Downing Street itself at the time. We have
had reaction from the Police Federation saying it expresses
great regrets about the decision to arrest an officer over this. It say
it is hopes that justice will prevail.
Thank you very much. The family of a man shot dead by
police officers have urged the inquiry into his death to declare
that it was an unlawful killing. Azelle Rodney died in April, 2005,
after an armed officer opened fire on the car he was in. The police
believed he had been armed and planning to rob a clopian drugs
gang.    Colombian. Susan Alexander
described her son's killing as an execution. She had to wait seven
years for the inquiry to get under way as sensitive intelligence
material was involved. This has been the final day of evidence.
Azelle Rodney was 24 when he was shot dead by the police in north
London. One officer fired eight bullets, six hit him in the head
and the body. For weeks his mother listened to
scores of witnesses, including the marksman who fired the fatal shots.
That officer did not give him time to put his hands up, get out or
anything, you know? So, you are supposed to stop and warn somebody
before you do something. He did not do that.
He didn't stand a chance. This footage, filmed from a police
car, recorded the shooting. The police were in pursuit of a
Caruanaying three men, including Azelle Rodney. Officers were
working on intelligence, that the men they were chasing were
respected of being armed with machine guns and on their way to
rip off a Colombian drugs gang. One officer stopped and opened fire.
Sweet as... This is a reconstruction of how the car drew
level with the Gulf and that officer, known only as E7, shot
Azelle Rodney in the back seat. E7 told the inquiry he believed that
the suspect was reaching forward for a weapon to open fire. Guns
were found in the car, but not in Azelle Rodney's hand. One former
Scotland Yard firearms commander, described the judgment call that
the marks men have to make. The police officer is aware that
the time frame that they are working to is about a quarter of a
second. Now that is how long it will take, potentially, for the
person in the car they are approaching to produce and to fire
a weapon. The inquiry chairman will now have
to decide whether the force used against Azelle Rodney was
absolutely necessary. He will produce his report next
year. At least nine girls have been
killed and three others injured in an explosion in Afghanistan.
A spokesperson for the governor of the Nangarhar province in the east
said that the girls were collecting fire wood when one of them hit a
landmine with an axe. The girls were said to have been aged between
nine and 12. The population of Scotland has risen to its highest
level. The ruls from the 2011 Census showed that the biggest rise
was amongst those over 0, but also increases in those under safplt
   15. Lorna, what do the figures tell us?
Well, this is a snapshot of what life was like in Scotland on the
27th of March, 2011. It throws up headline figures. The first being
that after 30 years of Scotland's population being stagnant or
declining, it is on the rise once again. Increasing by 233,000 to
just under 5 .3 million, according to the estimates. That means that
the population has increased by 5% between 20 2001 and 2011, the
fastest growth rate between two sensus dates in the last century.
It is also the first sensus when the number of people aged 65 and
over was higher than the number aged under 15. An increase notable
in people aged over 80, where the numbers have increased by 19%. Are
they boring statistic? Well, they are important. They help plan where
the public services are needed most. So what we know is that Scotland's
population is growing older and it is increasing.
Do we know why? As to the increasing, there is a couple of
minor reasons, we found that out today, one is that there are more
children under irthe age of five. There are also more births than
deaths. You don't get the break down in the figures that you had
for England and Wales, but because of earlier work, we know that the
suggestion is that the vast majority of the population increase
is due to migration. As to the ex ct    exact breakdown of ethnicity
and employment in Scotland, we will not find that out until the summer
of next year. Thank you very much.

England's cricketers have won a historic victory, winning a Test
Series in India for the first time in nearly 28 years. Centuries from
Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell helped to secure the draw that they needed
in the fourth and the final match in Nagpur to take the series 2 1.
Alastair Cook said it was a special day for the team.
Try, try, and try again. In India, England persevered, a slow march to
history. However much the country changes, one thing remains. At home
India's cricketers are expected to win. The only chance that they had
of taking the Test was to grab the wickets on Monday morning. Ian Bell
made the first 50 of of the series. Jonathan Trott went on and on. He
was India's irritant. India were not amused. Trt Jonathan Trott
thrives on this situation. At lunch England were nearly 250 runs ahead.
Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott still together. There was not time for
India to bowl England out again. India's tactic of beating England
by spin unravelled. The overwhelming win in the first Test
seemed like a dream. Ian Bell helped himself, but England were
patient. They were hopeless against spin bowling at the start of the
year. Was Kevin Pietersen at home in the dressing room again? It
looked like it. Jonathan Trott fell for 143, there was time for Ian
Bell to get to 100. Then the two teams agreed to a draw and the
series went to England. The new captain had done what no England
can't has managed for nearly 30 years.
It has been an incredible tour. To end it like we did today, to
convincingly bat out, it was a nervous dressing room, knowing how
close we were to doing see so special, but to do it as convincing
I    convincingly as we did, it was incredible.
This is the kind of result that careers are defined by.
Now let's have a look at the weather. Louise is here. It is
weather. Louise is here. It is brollies up, I'm afraid.
Some of vus seen sunshine, but I suspect that the story is for   
some of us have seen sunshine today, but I suspect that the showers will
be becoming more widespread. So far the showers have been over North
Wales, north west England and stretching into the north east of
Scotland. There is a cluster of a shower
cloud. The two weather fronts are straddled either side of northern
Britain. If you don't have the showers it is grey and damp, but
there are breaks into the central and the southern areas. You cling
on to the best of the sunshine. Then the showers becoming more
widespread. By the middle of the afternoon pushing into the south 
west. Highs of 10 Celsius, but come showers could be sharp. A cluster
of showers over Wales. More waiting out in the wings to push to the
west and the east. For Northern Ireland, not a bad
afternoon. About seven Celsius. Staying cloudy, but also dry. The
same tie for the Great Glen. There are the showers into parts of
Aberdeenshire and to the north west of the Pennines. Some starting to
migrate to the east. If you continue to see sunny spells in
East Anglia and the London area, I suspect for the evening rush hour
some of the showers could be frequent as they continue to drive
south west, this at the    they could be up to 50 miles an hour. In
the evening, clearer skies to the west and in the Northern Ireland
and in Scotland freeze ing fog and icy surfaces.
If the fog lingers that will affect the temperatures, further western
areas seeing the best of the brightness. A quiet day on Tuesday.
More cloud into the south east than today. Highs of five to 10 Celsius,
but all change for Wednesday. More wet and windy weather arriving.
Some significant rainfall likely. The potential may be for up to 30
millimetres of rain into the south  west. That is pushing to the north
and the east. A wet day in prospect. The highs looking about five to 12
Celsius. There are more details on the weather online or join me live
