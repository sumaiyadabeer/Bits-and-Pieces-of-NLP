Good evening. A cloak of darkness has fallen across the city. Rain is
coming. Yes, we're live. It's 10.00pm. But in here, the lovely
dry, warm atmosphere. Why don't you spend the next half an hour living
live with us in this room with extraordinarily talented people?
Yes, in every corner of the room, these folks are ready to give their
all. I think we'll all agree the first one is a giant of music, Sir

Ah, mater Want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
What she say, what she say
Jet
With the wind in your hair of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll go for a ride in the sky
And Jet, I thought that the major was a little lady suffragette

welcome the wonderful Neil Diamond.
You've got this wonderful record out, Dreams, where you have done a
lot of covers of songs you like, not so many of your own I am
surprised? Not many, but some of the greatest songs of the rock era.
I got to sing them. I got the chance to do it, and I love it.
Which is the one of your own do you do? I do I'm a Believer. A huge hit
for the Monkees. You do two Paul McCartney songs. I did. I did
Yesterday, and I did Black bird. lovely version. What we have is a
little clip of you on the Shirley Bassey show. Uh oh. We're going to
go down the time tunnel. It's going to be lovely.

You're going to be doing the Electric Proms this Saturday. Also

is that you and I have something strange in common. Very strange.

And I'm bound to fall Lovin' you, baby child
Sick for days, so many ways I'm achy now, I'm achy now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh show me how To get right
Yeah, it's out of sight
When I was young and movin' fast
Nothin' slowed me down Oh slowed me down
Now I let the others pass I've come around, oh come around
Cos I found
Livin' just to keep goin' Goin' just to be sane
All the while I know it's Such a shame
I don't need to get steady I know just how I feel
I'm tellin' you to be ready My dear.
I thought love was only true In fairy tales
Meant for somebody else But not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
Then I saw her face
Yeah I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind, yeah
I'm in lovE
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried
No, not if I tried
Not if I tried, no
I thought love was more or less A given thing
Seems the more I gave The less I got
What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I needed some sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face
And I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind, yeah
I'm in love
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried
No, not if I tried
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
Then I saw her face
And I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried
No, not if I tried
Not if I tried, no
Cos I'm a believer
Yeah, I'm a believer
Yes I am

Neil Diamond, I'm
Neil Diamond, I'm a
Neil Diamond, I'm a Believer from the Dreams LP. Before that, the
Black Keys, but now for this lovely song called Josephine from their
album, Ransom, we're delighted to And now I haunt the bars
And there was her man enjoying the lay of the land
He took a walk in the dark with a dish from the stand
Girls and their creations Tight in the brightest grenadine
But I'd take all that I've seen
For a slow drag with Josephine
Josephine, Josephine
But I'd trade all that I've seen
For a slow drag with Josephine
Gavotte, garrotes Cotillions and slow arabesques
Drum rolls and farandoles were all made in jest
But when you make that move I can't resist
When will you declare your armistice?
Josephine, Josephine
But I'd trade all that I've seen
for a slow drag with Josephine
In another time and place A different fate was cast
He tried to skeddle daddle do She might have slapped him
Just for saying "Grant one more chance before you pass
"Then curse the nurse that named me the first or bury me at last"
And in three quarter time The true and the false
Dancing the hesitation waltz
Then comes the flirtation And temptation
Hip, hip hooray Listen to what I say
Then you can take it away
Josephine, Josephine
Josephine, Josephine
But I'd trade all that I've seen for a slow drag with Josephine.

One of my
One of my favourite dances, the slow drag, Elvis Costello from his
Ransom LP. A superb room full of guests this evening. On a sad note,
yesterday we heard that Gregory Isaacs has passed away. Maybe we
could have a round of applause for him. Thank you to all of our guests.
Thank you Aloe Blacc for joining us, Neil Diamond for joining us over
there and look   my friend Alice Cooper is here. He's popped in to
do this final link with me. Feeling good? Yes, best club in town.
great to have you here. The Black Keys were great, weren't they?
Would you come back next week on Friday night and tell us about you
being on the Electric Proms? Absolutely. Kind of a guy that just
hangs around in here. It's nice to see him any time. Now we finish
where we started with the amazing Stuck inside these four walls
Like you, mama To a registered charity
If I ever get out of here If we ever get out of here
Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
I hope you're having fun
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam Were searching everyone
For the band on the run Band on the run
For the band on the run Band on the run
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the village square
For the rabbits on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam Were searching everyone
For the band on the run Band on the run
Yeah, the band on the run The band on the run
Yeah, the band on the run The band on the run
The band on the run Band on the run
Well, the night was falling as the desert world
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found
Band on the run Band on the run
And the county judge who held a grudge
Will search forever more
