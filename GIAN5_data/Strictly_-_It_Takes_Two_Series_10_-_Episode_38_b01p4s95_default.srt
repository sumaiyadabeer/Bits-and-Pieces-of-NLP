Hello, it is Wednesday, welcome to It Takes Two. I have two clever
couples on the sofa tonight. Probably the best tango of the
series so far, Kimberley and Pasha! This next lady has some
serious Samba moves. It is Dani and Vincent! And what do we
need to warm up these winter nights? We need a dose of Ian Waite.
He is here to warm us all up! This is It Takes Two. Where do
Live from Television Centre, this is Strictly: It Takes Two. Please
welcome your host, Zoe Ball.
Hello. Hello. Wow! Welcome to It Takes Two. I will be chatting to
Kimberley and Pasha in a minute. First, some breaking news:
Good evening. Here is the news. This Christmas, six new celebrities
will take to the floor for the Strictly Christmas Special.
I can now reveal the line  up. We have ex Premiership
footballer, Fabrice Muamba. One quarter of JLS, JB. And entertainer,
Sheila Hancock. Writer and comedienne, Katy Brand. And
daredevil and Blue Peter presenter, Helen Skelton. Plus, there is more.
There will be a special group routine featuring some of our old
Strictly favourites, Rachel Stevens, Chelsee Healey, Natasha Kaplinsky,
Kelly Brook, Chris Hollins, Tom Chambers and Colin Jackson will all
be back! Where's my invite? You can catch the Strictly
Special on BBC One on Christmas Day. It will be amazing. That was the
breaking news. I thank you. Come here. Kimberley and Pasha are
riding high after receiving their highest scores for the third week
running. Here is a reminder of how they gave us an affair to remember
with their fiery tango. I thought that you set the story of the dance
up brilliantly. You told that story all the way through which was
fantastic. The ultra vixen with a killer attitude. I haven't seen
such a mean pout since Joan Collins! Your hold goes in and out.
It is a little bit loose sometimes. But the mood of the dance and the
intensity of the dance was spot on! You can smile again now! You have
done your job. You have been moody, you have been in character. I allow
you to smile from now on! I didn't know I was pouting. This does
happen to me sometimes. I think it is something like this. Please
welcome Kimberley and Pasha. Congratulations on
Saturday night. It really was awesome. Let's discuss the pout
because Bruno did say that you were giving Joan Collins a run for her
money. Let's check it out. See. You are too young to have watched
Dynasty! I think you have took it to the next level. You loved the
tango. I did. Is it your new favourite? I think it is. I loved
it. I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the performance at the time.
That is hard sometimes with the nerves. I did. You could tell. You
can really tell when our celebrities are enjoying it. It
comes across in the whole performance? Yes. I'm enjoying it
and I can feel that we are together doing everything together at the
same time so I'm like, yeah! can relax. A happy Pasha! We could
see the relief on your face in the results show. You squealed a little
bit. A touch! That's all right. couldn't hear it(!) Have you
realised how much you want to stay in the competition? I already knew
how much I wanted to be here. But the relief was overwhelming. I was
so happy. I was thinking, yes, we have the jive. I was so happy.
feel it at home   yes, come on! Third week, third week, Pasha, Yo
you have got 34 again. How cross are you with those digits?
course we want to see them go up. It is very stable. Yeah. It is
consistent. That is good. That is a good thing. We are not at the
bottom. We are not at the top. We are in the middle. My favourite
number! A lot more praise for your storytelling. How important in your
dance is the storytelling? Every dance is a story. And if you can
add a little extra, it makes people relate to the dance even more than
just... That is exciting. When I'm out on a Saturday night and I give
it that, I need to give more story. Tell the story! It is
normally Artem who is the Drill Sergeant in the training room. In
his absence, this is a role you have been more than happy to take
on. No! Call me Sergeant Pain. 20 push ups. Be quiet! If it doesn't
hurt, you are not doing it right. Yes, Sergeant! Don't test my
patience. No! Be a man for once in your life. You will do it again.
Yes, Sir. You have a choice between right and wrong. You decided to go
with the wrong one. You need to be tough with her. Focus. Again, don't
cry to me. Just do it. Get it together, girl. Oh! You are fired.
Next. I don't like you very much! like that. He tosses her aside.
It is so funny. Last week, we got a onesie for Kimberley. So
we got you this. Sergeant Pain! love that! Don't count how many
stripes there are on the side. This week, it is the jive. Please wear
it. I will. Do you want to put it on now? You have been looking
forward to the jive? I have. you still saying that now? It is
really hard to keep that energy up for seven hours a day. I do love it.
You have a great record. This is the music. How are the energy
levels nine weeks in? How tough... He is like a bouncing bully! No, it
does get tough. My body's a bit like ouch, stop! How is your hip?
The hip is getting a little bit better. I am kind of just aching
everywhere now. You cannot notice the hip because everything else
hurts. I dance, dance, dance and then I seize up for a while.
should oil up her little joints. It is a tricky dance. What's
Kimberley finding the toughest about this one? If anything? She's
doing really good with the jive. It is just keeping that energy up from
the beginning because she starts like yeah, let's go! By the last
section, I'm like... Come on! And she is like, "I'm coming!" Will
that just come with time? I keep thinking we have to just do it.
Even today, we did half the dance and by the end we managed to run
through it. Half way through the week, this is good. You got 39 with
Chelsee last year. No pressure. God! Don't let him down. It is a
good dance for you. This will be good. How has Kimberley impressed
you? She's a workaholic. In a good way. So when it comes to making
something happen, she does it. Of course, I put a bit of reverse
psychology, no, it's OK, if you cannot do it... What I like is that
when we finish practising, she is like, "Let's do it again!" That is
what I do on my son when he won't do his biology homework! Can you
feel it now that you have improved, Kimberley? Yes, I can really feel
that I have. There's certain things that are clicking and I feel like,
oh yes, I get it now! He has been telling me it for nine weeks and
the penny drops! For me, I feel I have learnt so much already. I know
you will be brilliant this weekend. I hope so. Give it up for Kimberley
and Pasha. Thank you. time now to catch up with the man
who always has the inside track on He's big, he's blonde, he has a
magic wand   Ian Waite! I'm not so blonde any more. Now,
it's dark blonde. You are doing the Christmas Special. I am. Who have
you got? I've got the gorgeous, lovely Sheila Hancock. Lucky lady!
You will do brilliantly. Also, you have another lady as well?
dancing with Natasha Kaplinsky for the All Stars. Get you! Can't wait.
Let's talk about Lisa and Robin. Had a tough time from the judges
last week. She is back in the training room with the quickstep.
It is a fast moving quickstep. Lots of intricate promenade positions
which there lies the problem. There is a lot of promenade positions
where this happens. If I do this, you can see   I'm highlighting the
middle area. She needs to keep to him on those promenade positions
and not lose him. No gapping. also the rise and fall, she needs
to rise and fall at the same time as him. OK. It is very difficult
with a quickstep. It is early days. Denise and James, making a habit of
being the top dogs week after week. They are a bit good. Can they be at
the top for a fifth week? Well, it is a very impressive start here.
Very strong impact, lots of hardlines. They want to stay on top.
And it's so   because she went from that style last week, so elegant
and graceful, to this full on salsa. Now, for the first week I can
actually criticise something. you got something negative to say?
To be honest, it is really difficult to criticise her. She is
so good. She is so good. But I just wanted to highlight this area here.
She is over in that back bend. What I would like to say   I will do it
with you. No! This is obviously not how to do it! So you go over the
knee like that. If you get your hips up   get your knees together.
What? I can't! Knees together! my Lord! Denise, you are safe!
You can see how difficult it is. I can vouch that is
difficult. Hips up, knees together and she will be able to get her
head back a bit further. Michael and Natalie. He was in the bottom
two last week. But he puts in the most hours in training. Will that
pay off with the Samba? He needs to put in a few more! They
work so hard. He is working harder than anybody. He has trouble with
the Latin. Yeah. I have slowed this down. He is not bending in the
right place in the music. Now, every time you take a volter, you
have one, two, three, four, five, so you are always lowering on the
beat. We have all got that! Come on, Michael! My trousers have gone up!
Louis and Flavia. The judges keep giving him a hard time. He is so
brilliant. This week, the Charleston, that should be great
for him? For me, this is the chance for him to do that. If he can't do
it in Charleston, he won't do it in any dance. I feel he is restricted
in hold. With this dance, he has a lot of solo stuff and it's quite
intricate. Wow, look at that! is a difficult step. He has to keep
his balance and his spot. I can't get my leg up that high. Basically,
he just needs to show more expression with his face, to show
that he is enjoying it. I would like him to stretch that toe.
it. How high can you get your leg? Not that high! Has he
pulled something? Dani and Vincent are doing their Viennese waltz. We
will be talking to them soon. The Samba was so, so good. The Viennese
waltz, we want some tens for Dani. Could this be the week? She has
been doing so well. The Viennese waltz is a difficult dance because
of the continuous turn in it. It is a very technical dance. Because
there's only three steps in it, you have to get those steps really good
and you have to get the smoothness really good. It is all there for
you to see. You would think that would make it easier? No! What I
want her to do, if she can just get that under a little bit more. And
create a little bit more... that? Yes! A bit more of a banana
shape. I want her to think of bananas. OK. Keep thinking
of bananas. She needs to keep that banana shape up to create the space.
That is the old... Remember the head in the vase. A banana looks
like THAT! Let's talk about Kimberley and Pasha. She has been
talking about the energy of getting through the jive. It is tough.
is. And to keep up, especially with us pros, it is very difficult.
Pasha is so fast. She is behind him at the moment. But we are talking
about slow and fast twitch muscles. Now, slow muscles are the muscles
you use to do something slow. Jive is fast twitch muscles. I like that.
Ballroom. Ballroom. Jive. We can make him do that all day
long. Fantastic. I have lost my microphone. Nicky and Karen
are doing the Argentine tango. Can I say that Nicky was the only one
to improve on his score last week, so well done! This has come to us,
sent by phone from Ireland today, the wonders of technology. What are
you making of the Argentine tango? Still improving. He looks really
good. It goes to show putting in that hard work you can improve. In
the beginning, he was not a natural. Now, he is creating much better
lines. The only thing I can see is that he tends to hunch his
shoulders. Where should they be? Get them back for a start. Even in
the Argentine tango, it is quite a close hold, but you can still get
your shoulders back. Lovely. All right. Looking good. Can I say,
another delightful shirt and tie combination. He bought that tie and
the shirt came free! Ian Waite! Love him. I do love
him! It is OK, my husband knows. You don't know someone until you
see where they live. Well, we are about to get a whole new insight
into Louis Smith. What you doing here? Come on, come in! Don't trip
over my wicked shoes! Not bad. A man has to have a shoe collection.
I have a few shoes. I have to apologise, the house is a bit of a
mess. Too much going on, not here enough. I probably would have
cleaned up if I knew you were coming. That is a lie, I wouldn't  
sorry. This is my living room. Yes! This place is my comfort zone. I
own this space. When you come in, you are under a Louis zone. As you
can see, the sofas don't fit   I know. It is the reason why you have
to come round the back because I can't get to the front door. The
sofa is too big. The furniture for my new house, this is. On the plus
side, they are some comfy sofas. Mmm. That's what I'm talking about.
This is my pride and joy. 55 inch LED 3D TV. This is what I get
excited by. I love this game! Argh! This is supposed to say "home" but
I dropped it and it was supposed to be like that and now it says "Come".
Come to my fridge. My fridge. Look what's in my fridge. Lots of
hydration, lots of water, bacon and eggs in the morning. What every man
needs! You can see my Olympic Torch. I ran with this baby in Newcastle.
Ran? It was more of a jog. Right, I have covered downstairs. Let's go
upstairs. Look, a brief stop   look what I have found. Olympic medals!
This is my wardrobe. As you can see, I love clothes. Probably got about
60 pairs of shoes. Check out these shoes. I love them. I have also got
about another wardrobe full at my Mum's house. Got my hairdryer
sorted. My hair is a nightmare. So I have to shampoo it, I have to
condition it, then straighten it, and then I have to sleep with a hat
on my head to keep it slick, so I have everything. Here you have my
bedroom. The last room. Best room! This is where the magic should
happen but doesn't because I'm only here once a week. I have my TV,
candles, bed, what else do I need? This bed is comfy. It is about that
time when you guys left because Flavia will be knocking on my door
in the morning wanting to rehearse. You know the score. What is on the
door! So you should leave. See yourself out. Shush!
Louis Smith, that home sign was so funny. Thanks for letting us look
round your crib. I will be chatting to Dani and Vincent, but this is a
reminder of how they brought Samba sunshine to Saturday night.
Extraordinary, such a clean Samba. So clean. Loved it. Your attitude
and confidence at this point in the competition is brilliant. Loved the
bounce action. Fantastic arm placement. All the isolation, all
those body ripples were done to perfection. The Samba is a party
dance and I have to say you got this party started! Lots of basic
stuff going on and yet you kept that going. Fabulous! I moved my
hips! I am over the moon! Yes. is. I feel like a popstar. There
wasn't one bad comment. No. Goodbye Team Smurf, hello Team Dynamite!
Dani and Vincent! I want to be able to do it. Can I say, it
was a fantastic performance on Saturday night. Thank you. Get you,
the confidence at the top to start out there on your own. I know.
you impressed yourself? I didn't think I would be able to do that in
a million years. I was so nervous. It was horrible. I thought because
we went first and I had to start the dance on my own, there was so
much pressure but I loved every second of it. I did feel like
Beyonce. That is what we want you to say. How impressed were you?
Over the moon. It was an amazing Samba. And, yeah, Samba is very
hard. We said that the week before. You did. Yes, she was good. Thank
you very much. Thank you. Almost impressed there! Loads of
messages in from your fans. Lots of comments about your scores. Pauline
says, "When is that magic ten going to happen?" Are you as frustrated
as your fans? No, I don't think so. We are getting such good scores.
Four nines. That's good. Not moaning about it. Of course we want
a ten! I know. Fingers crossed. When we get a ten, it will be
special. Absolutely. I know. You didn't smash the record. No.
beat your own close personal best which was 32 with Louise Lytton.
That must feel pretty good. Thank you for that. Pleasure. Now, Dani,
your shimmies give Beyonce a run for their money. The thing we love
the most is the effect they had on Bruno. Have a look at this.
All the single ladies Put your hands up
All the single ladies... Craig is like that. He
can't let himself go. Now, despite great scores, you did look
distressed in the results show on Sunday. Did you think you were
going to be in the bottom two? don't know any more. Kimberley has
been in the bottom two. Nicky has been in the bottom two. No one is
safe. I want to say so much because I'm having the best time ever. And
I want it to last as long as possible. It is terrifying. Another
week. Now, training can be relentless and we know for a fact
that it can be hard to motivate your partner. Not hard for Mr
Simone. Of course. Come into my office. The worst is yet to come!
You are making my life miserable. Sorry. So many things to remember.
I don't know how you do it. You don't, really! I really want this
to be oh! I'm going to do the... the what? More oh! You know? Just
oh! This is very simple. It is not. For me! It will be hard. I can do
you should! You need to work harder! What is wrong with
these people? You get to spend so much time with this man. You are so
lucky! I know. You have brought more Italian into the studio this
week. This week is all about Italia. This is your music.
the mozzarella... Oh! You know what all of those are? I do. I know what
mozzarella is! Do you know what the mood is? I think so.
Thanks(!) I know some great Italian. SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN "The parrot is
Viennese waltz going? I love it. It is a good dance for us. It is
pretty and it flows nicely. There's lots of spinning. How are you
finding that? It is fine. Dizzy. You did the waltz, that was your
first dance. Is this familiar territory? Has that helped? Sort of.
It feels like a million years ago since we did the waltz. It is quite
similar but it is faster. So how is Dani getting on with the fleckerl?
Good. You are doing fine, no? like the fleckerl. She is doing
fine. She is doing the fleckerl. She is the fleckerl! We
could carry on with this all night! How much do you want that place in
the semifinal? We are nearly there. I want it so much. Please. I want
to do it for Papa Smurf! How are your family coping with you being
in the show? How proud are they? How nervous do they get on Saturday
night? Have they made T shirts? They have. They were at the pub
watching it on Saturday. There were 40 of them. They have been really
supportive, not that I have seen them for weeks. You won't for a few
more! Good luck this weekend. you. SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN Not quite
the accent there! You know what mozzarella is! Best of luck!
That is it for today. Thanks to all my guests. Join me
