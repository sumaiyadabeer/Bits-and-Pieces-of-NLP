Britain's animals are under threat.
All too often our wildlife and domestic pets
are the victims of cruelty, persecution and neglect.
Fighting to save them is a dedicated band of people trying to protect
and care for them right around the clock. This is Animal 24:7.
In the air, on land and in the water, Britain is a haven for animals.
But when they come up against man, their lives are often in danger.
From our cramped inner cities to our fields and hedgerows,
from the highest moorland to the coast and beyond,
Animal 24:7 is with the people working around the clock
to save endangered wildlife and protect vulnerable pets.
These are their stories.
On today's programme   two friendly dogs left alone in a garden with no owner in sight.
I am concerned for them, especially as we have got this hot weather at the moment.
And I lend a hand mimicking mum for a bunch of chirpy chicks.
It feels amazing to be so close to these rare birds.
And the puppy in agony with a broken leg. The RSPCA investigate.
When I got to the end of the path, I could hear Roxy screaming out in pain.
First we are off to Wales and to a report of two dogs abandoned in a back garden.
The neighbours say the owners have been forced to move out
and it doesn't look like they're coming back.
RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben is on the case to find out
if these dogs are unwanted or have simply been forgotten.
It's a hot day in Cardiff and in this back garden,
German Shepherd Rocky and a small Jack Russell called Apollo appear to be all alone.
Although they look happy, it seems their owners have been evicted, leaving their pets.
This is the second time RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben has been to see the dogs.
He needs to find out whether anyone is caring for them.
I found a German Shepherd dog and a Jack Russell terrier type dog in the back garden.
So what I've done is I've to tape up the property with some seals
just to tell whether anyone has gone in and out of the property.
The seals all look intact. I'm going to check the seals I put on the back gates
and if they are intact, then we'll go from there and check on the condition of the dogs.
The gate is padlocked. There was my card left on the combination lock. So no one has been through the gate.
  The dogs know they now have company.
You can hear the dogs already, so, great(!)
And Keith doesn't know if their bark's worse than their bite.
But he has to get close up to check on their condition.
The dogs are bright and alert and you can hear them quite well.
My card is still on the gate.
So it doesn't look like anyone's been through.
That was the day before yesterday I left them there.
I'm just going to see if there is any water or food been placed,
and we'll make some inquiries to see whether we can get them removed.
There we are. We've got to climb over this.
The calling card is still there, but a neighbour spots Keith
and explains that someone does keep coming to feed the dogs.
She also tells him that the locals have been helping out too.
All right, all right.
The dogs have got some water up in the end bowl there.
But the neighbours, have been throwing bits of food over, some biscuits.
A neighbour said they'd been thrown chicken over.
So they're not doing bad really.
I am concerned for them, especially as we've got this hot weather at the moment.
I should think they're quite well loved.
It just seems a shame no one's been down and given us a ring.
The residents have kept their own neighbourhood watch over Rocky and Apollo and, thanks to their help,
Keith doesn't think the dogs are in any immediate danger.
He decides to give their owners one more chance to get in touch.
I'm just going to give them some food.
It's not the best stuff but it will keep them going.
I am going to top up their water.
I'm going to leave them today, I'm going to give the owners
another day, so they will have had three days.
And if they're still here tomorrow then I am going to look into removing them.
Because obviously they can't stay here in this predicament, not being tended to.
That is possibly an offence being committed there. People have a duty of care to care for their animals.
And obviously this isn't going on.
Are you thirsty? Is that not very fresh?
Is that not very fresh?
There's a couple of litres here of fresh water,
because here the water is probably a couple of days old now.
That's enough for them to be getting on with it.
The dogs seemed delighted to have some company.
It looks good enough to eat, doesn't it?
But after the gourmet treats from the neighbours, how will they react to mere dog food?
What's this?
Oh.
Is that not good? No?
Although Apollo turns his nose up.
OK, Rocky, are you OK? Yes.
Rocky is nowhere near as fussy and eagerly gulps down Keith's offering.
It's good for me to see him eat.
It shows that he was hungry and reinforces the fact that perhaps no one is attending.
But it's not just food and drink that Keith's concerned about.
It's a hot day and with only a shed for shelter, he needs to be certain they are not suffering.
He must be pretty hot in this coat.
If I had hair like this, I would be pretty hot.
He doesn't seem too dehydrated at all. Hey?
You are quite nice for a German Shepherd, aren't you?
And you, little rascal?
The little Jack Russell just wants to play a think.
Where's your ball then, where's your ball? Go find your ball?
Ready? Sit down. Sit. Sit down. Sit.
Although Keith's not overly concerned, he will keep an eye on the weather.
If it gets any hotter, he'll be straight back.
I can't do this all day!
Meanwhile it's obvious Rocky and Apollo don't want their new friend to leave.
Still to come   another day, another visit.
Will anything have changed?
Biscuit selection for dogs.
Someone's obviously been to feed them.
I really need to speak to those people as soon as possible.
And Roxy the pup gets her own physio workout to help her recover.
What we're going to do is actually bend this to 90 degrees.
  So if you repeat that 10 times.
  Yep.
There is a bird that was once common here in the heart of England.
Indeed, it thrived in every county throughout Britain.
But now if you wanted to find one, you'd have to go
hundreds of miles north to Scotland, and it's pretty rare there.
It is the corncrake.
But here at Whipsnade Zoo, they've developed a very successful breeding and release programme.
And for the first time, they're letting the cameras in so we can show you the full story.
This is a top secret high security installation housing some of Britain's rarest birds.
Out of sight of the hordes of visitors to Whipsnade Zoo,
these look like they've been forgotten.
They are in fact the vital starting point for this special operation.
The man in charge of raising the numbers of corncrakes in Britain is Jamie Graham.
I hear about them being one of our most treasured and threatened birds.
I wondered if you could paint the picture more fully?
Well, they used to be in every county in England and Scotland
and in Wales and Ireland, they were they were so common.
But it's one of these things that's happened before.
Mechanisation of farming has wiped out all the corncrakes in England.
The only place they breed now is north west Scotland, on the Inner Hebrides.
  Really, they have all gone?
  All gone, every single one.
And that was in a really quick period of time, less than 100 years.
The birds in the pens are resident and encouraged to lay eggs which are then taken away.
This may sound cruel, but if the eggs hatch
and their young see the stars, they will always think Whipsnade is home.
The first night sky they see is where they return to.
That's amazing. So the idea is that that image of the night sky is imprinted on the chick's retina.
And it will lock up precisely to that pattern again?
It's amazing they can do this.
It is a recognised way of certain birds to be able to get back to certain areas.
It is believed corncrakes do this.
We hand rear them to make sure they don't see a night sky at Whipsnade.
You don't want them coming back?
No, this is not the right habitat.
East Anglia where they're going to be released.
Yes, that's where we want them to breed.
They have to see the first night sky at the Nene.
So we rear them indoors under cover so they don't see any night skies.
Our job today is to check whether any birds have laid a full clutch of eggs.
That means finding 8 10 eggs in one nest.
The corncrakes also need to be fed, and they're very timid, so it's softly softly.
(I saw one, it's just up there.)
Finally I catch my first glimpse and feel extremely privileged.
There she is.
She's just come out of the undergrowth. Beautiful.
There's a nest in here that I know of.
And yesterday there were four eggs in it.
So today we are looking for a fifth.
The nest is just about there.
Yes. There are five eggs. Fantastic.
With five eggs, this bird is halfway there.
She needs to be given more time to lay a full clutch.
But after much searching, there's no sign of a nest with the full count.
Luckily for me though, the right numbers have been laid earlier,
and Jamie knows just the place to see some newly hatched chicks.
The corncrakes' very own maternity ward.
So what's the next stage?
We are going into the corncrake brood room, where the chicks are reared.
You say corncrake room. I see there is a No Entry sign, it's not a bunker is it?
We just have to make sure that everything is quiet in here.
We always make sure, nice and quiet.
Birds are safe and secure. So they don't get used to human voices.
It's really good. It looks just like a hospital ward.
They have curtains round where they've got all the patients.
Except here, it's not to stop us seeing them, as much to stop them seeing us, is that right?
  That's true.
  How do you feed them?
Well, a bit of comedy but I need to put a sock on.
I've got a pair of tweezers to be the beak. And then I just put the food in.
There's the corncrake.
So the idea of that is it doesn't look like a human hand.
That's the main reason.
Like this.
And then straight down like that.
Brilliant.
  They are sweet, are they?
  Fantastic little things.
I'm just tapping the bowl to get them over.
  Can I have a go now?
  Of course you may. I'll take this out.
You just need to get yourself socked up. There's the head and beak.
I love the high tech face of science!
Yes!
Put this one in.
Brilliant. It's such an unusual thing to do.
To be encouraging birds to come up and grab maggots from a pair of tweezers. They get on?
Yes.
Feels amazing to be so close to these rare birds.
Go on.
It's strange to be feeding chicks with a glove puppet.
But working alongside Jamie, I am beginning to understand how important this level of care is.
It's really tempting to peek round and have a look at these cute little chicks.
But I mustn't because they mustn't associate me with food or anything good.
Humans must be a threat.
With dinner over, it's time for their health checks.
Vet Tim Bouts is in charge, and it's essential we keep our voices down
to prevent spooking the timid chicks.
Come and have a listen to the heart and the lungs.
This one feels absolutely great.
The breast muscle feels nice and plump so it's in good condition.
So now I'll have a look in the mouth for parasites.
Then they have to be sexed, and that calls for extreme measures   a blood sample.
You can see here the tiny little blood vessel.
That's what we have to try to go in.
Is this the only way you can tell, by taking a blood sample?
You could do it with feathers but that is very unreliable in corncrakes.
So the best DNA in corncrakes comes from the blood.
Obviously we can't take much blood from such a small bird.
So we have to be very, very careful.
These precious young are carefully placed back on their beds. In a few weeks' time they will sent
70 miles away to Cambridgeshire
where they will finally catch a glimpse of those all important stars.
Coming up   a prickly problem.
Catching corncrakes from a forest of nettles.
After a week or two you get a bit hardened.
  So that's all the nettle stings?
  That's all the nettle sting.
And a young cat abandoned in a box that needs help.
She's got a wound on her there. She may have some more wounds
but I don't want to pull her round too much.
Caring for and treating sick or injured animals is only part of an RSPCA inspector's job.
They also have to determine whether they've been the victims of cruelty.
In Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, a young puppy is recovering from a major operation
after being brought in to a vet's with a broken leg.
It is alleged the dog has been mistreated, so now the RSPCA have been called in to investigate.
This is Roxy, a 14 week old bull mastiff cross.
She was rushed to the vet's at the weekend with a badly broken leg.
The vet was concerned that Roxy's injuries had been ignored.
Now the RSPCA have been called.
I have been told it's fallen down the stairs, was left overnight screaming in pain.
It's not acceptable to leave it like that.
Inspector Mandy Barr has now begun an investigation to find out exactly what has happened to Roxy.
She has had to have an extremely expensive operation to actually fix the leg.
And she has got three pins and a plate in her leg.
Her first job is to speak to a witness who knows the puppy's owner.
The information Mandy receives will help her decide whether he should be prosecuted for cruelty.
  Hi, I've come to see your statement. Are we all right to come in?
  Yeah.
The witness explains that she spoke to Roxy's owner who told her his dog was not well.
I said, "Well, what's wrong with her?"
And what was his reply?
He said, "It could be that she swallowed something or it's her stomach."
  He sounded intoxicated.
So I asked my dad to give me a lift straight over.
When I got to the end of the path I could hear Roxy screaming out in pain.
And was it constant screaming, or was it...?
Really loud. Agonising screaming.
I can still hear it now.
I'll just put it was...
It's stressful to relive the experience, but Mandy must get all the details.
He was sat on the doorstep,
and I rushed straight into the front room.
And she were lying half hanging off her bed.
She was telling me that her arm... She were putting her leg up like that and it were all twingeing
and she were letting me know she were in pain with the leg.
  Are you all right?
  Yeah.
I know it's upsetting thinking about it. OK.
She wasn't the Roxy that I knew.
  She was just quiet?
  She was like a different dog.
You could see straight away that it was a major serious injury.
Despite Roxy being in agony, her owner hadn't taken her to the vet.
Thankfully this woman did.
And Roxy immediately received emergency surgery on her leg that was broken in three places.
Now Mandy wants to talk to the surgeon to find out just how bad Roxy's injuries are,
and whether there is any chance of her walking again.
From this view we can see this is the outer side of the bone.
You can see that this is the lateral knuckle and has folded inwards giving a fractured defect there.
And the medial side has become completely freed and shunted up the limb.
So, an important fracture because it involves the elbow.
We tend to see problems with these even when they are actually adequately repaired.
So we have used two plates, one on either side of the bone.
And then we used this large screw which is a lag screw,
so it's compressing and pulling those two knuckles back together.
Although the operation was a success,
Roxy still has a long way to go.
Hi, Roxy. Hello, gorgeous girl.
A broken leg this young may mean she will never walk properly again.
The physiotherapist explains exactly what treatment she needs.
What we want to do is make sure this joint is a still fully mobile.
Just pop your hand in front of me.
What we want to do it is bend this to 90 degrees, and then down again.
So if you repeat that 10 times.
When she's stood down, we want to make sure that the lower part of the foot doesn't become too tight.
So we just do carpal extensions by gently flexing the toes, so you can do those 10 times as well.
That's great.
Right, puppy. Come on then, Roxy.
We don't want to give you back, do we?
Roxy's good nature has already won her some new friends but now it's time to go.
Mandy's found her a place at a nearby kennels where staff
can concentrate on giving her that all important physio.
But with such a serious break, it could take time for this puppy's leg to mend.
A week and dozens of physio sessions later,
Mandy's brought Roxy back to vet Andy Torrington
to see if her leg has started to heal.
Come on then, sweetheart.
Pop you down. She's just being a pain and doesn't want to walk, that's all.
But otherwise, she's doing really well. She's been getting up OK.
When they've been doing the physios, sometimes it's really easy,
sometimes it's a bit stiff.
It doesn't seem to be a problem.
  We'll take her for a walk and watch her moving around a little bit.
  Come on then.
Where are we going? Come on.
If the operation's been a success, Roxy should be able to move freely and put weight on the injured limb.
This is her big moment.
Walk up towards the end of the car park and then back if she will go that far.
And as soon as she set foot outside,
she proves she's feeling much better.
Good girl. Yes.
  Roxy's certainly got a spring in her step.
  Very good.
Loading the limb very nicely.
She's advancing it very well.
So far, so good.
It seems Roxy's on the mend and getting back to being the playful puppy she should be.
I'm really happy to get it early on and to get her fixed
and to see how well she's doing. It's really good. She's very popular.
All the nurses love her.
So yeah, I'm sure she'll have no trouble being re homed at the end of the day.
12 months later, and Roxy was finally given the all clear.
She's now fully grown and enjoying the affections of her new family, the Dixons.
I saw her in one of the local papers.
It was an advert and I fell in love with her straight away.
Despite Roxy's rough start in life, her good nature has always shone through
and the Dixons couldn't resist her sad story.
I think it was because she was being a cruelty case and somebody had already mistreated her
and she had lived at the RSPCA for an entire year and never had the chance of having a loving home.
And knowing that we could give that,
it was that that actually attracted me to her.
Roxy has come on in leaps and bounds, and has grown up into a lovely dog.
Today Mandy has come along to see how the sad and abused puppy
  she picked up a year ago is getting along.
  I'm very excited see her now.
She's always been a lovely dog.
It will be nice to see her again.
Hello, darling!
Roxy, what have you got?
Oh, aren't you lovely now?
She's grown a bit.
You have. She's beautiful. Are you getting on all right with her?
Oh, she's absolutely fantastic.
I don't know what we'd have done without her.
So, her leg's not giving her any problems, she is not shown any signs of limping or anything?
No, no. We wouldn't have known there was anything wrong with her.
It's nice to see her out of the kennel and not stuck in there,
going on your little walks in the day when they could fit you in.
It is just so nice to see her all recovered
and in a nice home and obviously enjoying herself.
She's definitely getting her walks because she's got nice big muscles on her, those back leg muscles.
The RSPCA did prosecute Roxy's previous owner for causing her unnecessary suffering.
He pleaded guilty and was banned from keeping animals for 10 years.
Meanwhile, Roxy's finally back on all four paws and enjoying the life she deserves.
  Coming up  
  Go on. There you go.
Corncrake comeback   releasing one of Britain's rarest birds.
There he is! That looks great, it suddenly leapt out.
Now we're back to the story of Rocky and Apollo,
the two dogs living in a garden after their owners moved out.
Since there were signs that both dogs were being fed and weren't in immediate danger, RSPCA inspector
Keith Hogben left a note asking whoever owns them to get in touch.
He was to discover why the dogs had been left behind, and if their owners are coming back for them.
24 hours after his last visit, Keith is back at the empty house
to check if anyone has been home to look after Apollo and Rocky.
Straight away he notices things have changed.
Hello, you! Hello, Rocks.
I can see the back gate from here, and the card
that was on the lock has now gone, so someone has been through there.
So that changes the whole perspective of the incident. We are going to have a look at the dogs now.
Because the card is gone, we might
give them today to make contact with us.
Although it appears the dogs have had a visitor, Keith needs to check
whether they have been given the food and drink they need.
It looks like there's been more water. This wasn't here yesterday.
There we are.
Biscuits, "selection for dogs".
So, someone has obviously been to feed them.
I don't know where the biscuits are,
whether they have eaten them. So someone is looking out for them.
But I just really need to speak to those people as soon as possible.
The dogs may be fed, but there's more to caring for a pet.
Although Rocky and Apollo have learned to entertain themselves, dogs do need human contact.
Keith leaves yet another card telling the owners to call, and this is their last chance.
I'm going to check in the shed, check everything's all right.
The dog seemed friendly enough.
We will see. You watch, as he runs at me and attacks me.
Luckily, Rocky is no guard dog and just welcomes some attention.
Come on then! Hello! What I can see in the shed, there's a fresh bowl of water in there,
there's a bed and there's a couple of dog bowls of biscuits,
so someone has been back and are tending to them.
I just wish they'd get in contact with us so we know what's going on.
Because you're a lovely boy, aren't you? Yes, you are. And you are.
See you later, you. Yeah?
Unfortunately, Keith has no time to play.
His days are packed with calls about pets that need his help.
There's another animal all alone, but this one has been abandoned in mysterious circumstances.
We've had a call from a gentleman at this property here.
He's opened his front door today and found a cat been dumped in a basket on his doorstep,
so we'll just have a look at it now.
The caller has no idea where the cat came from or why it was left outside his house.
I reckon it's going to be
in this, if this is the wicker basket it's been abandoned in.
Wary that the cat might try and escape, Keith approaches with caution.
Hey, Bagpuss.
But his frightened feline isn't going anywhere in a hurry.
A little dark haired tortoise shell cat.
I can see she's got a wound on her there.
Hello, sweetheart.
Hello.
She does need to get to a vet's, get checked out.
She may have some more wounds on her, underneath, I don't want to pull her round too much.
You're just scared, aren't you, darling, eh?
Before taking the cat the vet's, Keith wants to see if she's been microchipped.
If she has, he'll have details of her owner, which could give him a clue to why this cat was dumped.
She does seem friendly enough, but I'm going to take my gloves just in case,
because if I pick her up she may be a bit nervous.
Keith is used to handling all kinds of pets and knows fear can make them lash out.
Hello, darling.
You're only a youngster, aren't you?
But this tabby is subdued, possibly through pain from its injuries, and proves easy to handle.
Keith's next job is to gently scan her for that all important microchip.
I had a hunch she would have one, but she hasn't unfortunately.
There we are.
So I'm going to pop her up to the vets, but before we do that
I'm going to put up a couple of lost posters in the area.
Someone may think, "I recognise that cat."
And it may jog someone's memory and they may give us a ring.
We'll pop her in the van and then we'll pop a couple of posters up.
All right. I know you're crying.
The cat's wound needs checking by a vet.
But Keith is optimistic about her future.
A cat like this, especially a young tortoise shell,
should be easy to re home it, as it is a youngster.
A lot of people want young cats rather than elderly cats.
But I'm hoping we may be able to trace the owner
and find out the story behind it because it's very frustrating.
It's all very well the cat getting re homed,
which is great for the cat, but there's always a story behind it.
I want to know why it's been dumped in a box etc, etc.
Someone may have stolen the cat and dumped it, whatever.
Or it could be someone's in some sort of trouble and couldn't cope with a cat.
In the past, detective work has paid off for Keith.
Even if he can't find the owner, he's hoping to solve the mystery
of why this cat was left abandoned on a doorstep.
I've probably put a couple of hundred of these up over the last 10 years
and I reckon probably about 60% I'd had replies to. I think they're really good.
They're nice and bright.
It's just another way of trying to contact the owner, as well as a microchip.
We'll put two of these posters up now, probably
a quarter of a mile away from each other,
someone might recognise the cat and give us a ring.
Keith must wait to see if anyone gets in touch.
For now, he needs to take the cat to the vet and get to the bottom of what's caused her injuries.
Later, the dumped kitten bearing the scars of neglect.
It looks like they could be burn wounds on three of her four paws.
By the 1970s, the corncrake was wiped out in England.
But thanks to Whipsnade Zoo they're making a comeback.
I've been given unique access to the secret location, where they breed the birds.
But hand rearing these creatures is not as easy as it seems.
Not only must they never see a human feeding them,
they also can't see the night sky until they're released.
That's because corncrakes use the stars to find their way home.
If they saw the ones at Whipsnade they would always return there, and that's not what the zoo wants.
Their aim is to get the corncrake back around Britain.
70 miles away, in Cambridgeshire, some young corncrakes are being moved to these holding pens,
in a place that they will now consider home.
Jamie Graham from Whipsnade is on hand to ensure things run smoothly.
So what's the plan here today?
All the chicks being reared down at Whipsnade are here now,
so they're going to be processed, weighed and measured.
And just you involved today?
No, there's a big team.
RSPB guys and our vets, just to do all the processing before they get released.
  And is that those guys over there?
  Yeah, let's meet them.
The first stage is to round up the birds that are going to be freed.
Professor Rhys Green is in charge and thinks there's some in this pen.
There's so much vegetation, you know there's life in there,
  but you don't know how many there are until we get them out.
  Until you lay your hands on them.
And they can be very hard to find, so sometimes you think one's died, but they're just lurking.
Time to catch a corncrake or two.
But, as you can imagine, it's not an easy task.
There's still something here.
Probably not.
Get him back up again.
OK. We'll start again then.
Got no idea where he is now.
The vegetation is so dense, it's hard enough even to find them, let alone to catch them.
It really is quite a struggle.
It's not only dense, it's also made up of stinging nettles,
that provide perfect shelter and a wealth of insects for food.
Then, under the watchful eye of spectators, Rhys proves he's a master of his craft.
That's a feisty one.
Yeah, got him. There's another one on the right still.
As the morning wears on, more and more birds are collected.
Have you got a bag, Rhys?
They're placed into bags, where the dark will keep them calm.
Got one.
They all look very good.
This one's slightly punier than the last two but OK. I think.
  That's seven, is it?
  Yeah.
  OK, we're coming out now.
So are you happy with what we've got, Rhys?
Yeah, that's pretty good so far.
Until we weigh them we're not really sure, but the feel of them
is that they're in good nick, and no obvious injuries or anything.
Well, they haven't got any injuries, but I gather you've got a bit of a...
Slightly reddened compared what it was when I arrived. After a week or two, you get a bit hardened.
  So that's all the nettle stings?
  Yeah.
Rhys doesn't need a doctor, but the corncrakes do need to see the vet for a final health check.
First, though, Rhys makes his own detailed inspection.
I'm just measuring its head and bill,
which is a general measure of how big it is.
  The birds are weighed in.
  Every bird gets a detailed check up.
And it's all recorded for later analysis.
Why do you need to take all that very detailed technical data?
We've been studying this for several years, and we've found that
these measures of weight and size, we can work out a measure of body condition, and it does turn out
that birds that are in the best body condition now, at release, are the ones that come back.
So the fitter you can make them now the better chance they have of surviving that long journey?
Yes. The more chance that they will be back.
Stick that one back on the end.
It's not just about stats.
Tim Bouts the vet who looks after the corncrakes at Whipsnade
is here to give them the all clear to fly free for the very first time.
Feel the breast muscle, that's fine.
And then we'll listen to the heart.
Perfect. That one can be released too.
Excellent.
But not all of the corncrakes make the grade.
So talk me through what you're thinking with this bird.
We weighed this one and it's about 15% lighter than a chick of this age in the wild in Scotland would be,
and this bird has got Scottish parents, so that means it's lighter than we'd like.
It is skinnier than the other birds.
It could do with a week of waiting.
  So you're unlikely to let it go today?
  Unlikely today.
Just two failed the tests and have to wait for another day.
We're off with the rest of them to find a suitable release spot.
It's amazing. When you think they are probably fewer than 50 breeding pairs of corncrakes in England
and I've got seven birds hanging off my fingers here.
Just shows how important this project is to the species.
Jonathan Taylor is in charge of this stage.
Mind the wire.
He finds us the perfect patch.
So what is it about this place that makes it so good for corncrakes?
Well, on the Nene Washes here, we've got lots of wet grassland,
and particularly what the corncrakes are after is the hay meadows and this swamp here,
vegetation which can remain uncut until late in the season.
  So the birds have plenty of cover.
  Looking forward to this?
  It's going to be fantastic.
  This is a good patch of mixed vegetation.
Plenty of broad leaf herbs and tall grasses and sedges.
Pretty much what the corncrakes are looking for.
So if we prepare a small tunnel
to release the bird into so it doesn't fly off into the air.
It's important that they're released here and don't fly off
because we know this has got all the right cover.
Time to let the bird out of the bag.
They're quite feisty, these birds.
It can see the light, head out the bag.
  Off it goes.
  Can I release one?
Absolutely. This is a good place.
Don't be shy. Go on.
Out you go.
Ooh! There he goes! That was great! He just suddenly leapt out.
Given that it's about 40 days old,
that bird will potentially migrate within one week from the site.
So most are only going to be here one or two weeks
before they fly to Africa?
Yeah. They'll be here up to around about four to six days old, and then they will be on their way.
And what proportion will make it back?
All going well, around about 25% of the birds will return.
They've got quite a high mortality rate
for this kind of bird.
It's a tricky and long journey.
It's a hard journey and they've got a lot of obstacles on the way,
sea crossings, tricky desert crossings.
On to the next one?
Let's go. Release some more.
That was nice.
Thanks to these seven birds, the number of corncrakes here has increased.
Let's hope they return safely from the winter sun in Africa,
ensuring their breed is less rare than it used to be.
Time now to return to RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben.
Last time we saw him he was concerned about Rocky and Apollo,
two dogs left alone in a back garden.
I'm pleased to say that their owners did contact Keith
and they collected their dogs.
They're now all happy in their new home.
But those pets weren't Keith's only problem.
There was also the young tabby cat, with mysterious injuries,
dumped in a box on a doorstep.
At the local vets, Keith arrives with his latest rescue.
Inside, Rob Thompson is waiting to check the cat over.
This will give Keith his first proper look at the cat, too.
The vet immediately spots the nasty sore on the cat's back.
Self induced scratching, most probably, and the little black specks
would be flea dirt.
We'll hunt for some fleas in a moment.
But it's very likely self induced.
She's been scratching herself.
Lots more black specks.
And some fleas running around.
The fleas have caused the cat to hurt herself by rubbing her back to stop the itching.
If she's got fleas, we have to assume she may have other things.
Ear mites would be very common.
But they're both fine. No ear mites there.
Next, the vet checks her heart and lungs.
That's absolutely fine.
The fleas would be causing physical irritation, which is why she's been scratching there.
She's just been sneezing a bit.
  Would that be anything to worry about?
  That wouldn't be related to the fleas. Her chest sounds fine.
It's very likely that she might have a slight infection.
There's no sign of the flu virus.
The antibiotics that we're going to give for her skin should be able to take care of that at the same time.
With some antibiotics to kill the fleas and help heal her wound,
the cat should be fit for re homing.
But there are two essential checks needed first.
We just have to wait about 10 minutes for our tests to complete.
Two blood tests for feline AIDS and leukaemia.
If either of these are positive,
this cat has little chance of surviving.
As the vet waits for the results,
he spots some other injuries missed on his first examination.
They look like there could be burn wounds on three of her four paws.
I don't believe those to be malicious wounds,
where someone has purposely burnt her.
And probably just accidental.
Falling into a hot bath would be the most common.
They seem to be probably five days to a week old,
because they are already actually healing.
This young tabby is clearly in a bad way.
Keith's hoping there'll be no more surprises.
  That looks good, does it?
  Yes. Negative result on both.
Brilliant. So we can treat for the fleas.
With the right treatment and a hefty dose of TLC, the cat should make a full recovery.
As she's been given, not the all clear, but she's had her treatment, she can go.
Her next stop is the RSPCA's boarding canals in Merthyr Tydfil for round the clock care.
Knowing she's in safe hands, Keith's only concern now is trying to trace the young cat's owner.
Four weeks later, and Keith still hasn't found the owner,
but Star, as she's now called, doesn't seem to mind.
Her wounds have healed and now she's living with a loving foster family
until she can be found a more permanent home.
We've got two dogs, who are 12, and three cats,
the oldest one being 22, the youngest, two.
And she's fitted in with all of them.
She had no hesitation approaching them.
And she curls up with one of the dogs on the settee when she feels like it.
And Beverley can't understand how anyone could have dumped such a friendly feline.
It does really frustrate me that you find that animals are still being abused and abandoned,
when there's so much help out there with the RSPCA, and Cats Protection.
Star was abandoned, but luckily, she was found,
and as you can see, she's fine now.
But not all animals are that lucky, and it is really sad.
Living with a foster family means Star can enjoy home comforts while she waits for a new owner.
When Star goes, she's our first foster cat,
and I'm sure it will be upsetting.
But we know she's going to go to a good home,
and if you care about animals, you can't help but get attached.
If you think you know of a case of wildlife crime or a creature that needs immediate protection,
remember, there are dedicated professionals out there who will answer your call around the clock.
They are the people we meet on Animal 24:7.
