Anne Davies and me, Dominic Heale. Our top story tonight   the store
owner who says travellers have This was the moment travellers
broke through padlocks and moved caravans on to his car park.
Also, banned from keeping pets for ever. The man he start for
of Nottinghamshire announces her retirement.
And the start takes centre stage. Liza Minnelli's special point in
the East Midlands.    special Welcome to Wednesday's programme.
First tonight   customers are deserting a shopping centre after
travellers moved their caravans into the car park. The owner of the
the travellers breaking locks to get in. He's been told to get an
injunction to move them on   but says that's pointless, they'll just
return at a later date. The travellers say they wouldn't need
to live on car parks if councils provided them with proper sites.
James Roberson reports. Back again   travellers' caravans
result? The owners of the Armstrong's Mill outlet in Long
Eaton say the shop's virtually empty of customers. They claim
trade has dropped off sharply since the travellers first moved onto the
car park in June. It is intimidating people to go in the
car park. Didn't want to shop, it is not a safe place. The owner,
Kieron Armstong, showed me what steps they'd taken to protect their
site when the travellers moved off temporarily. They spent over �6,000
on lockable gates and CCTV system. But last Thursday the CCTV recorded
men smashing the locks off the gates and then caravans returning
to the car park. Why did you just take them to court? The police
recommended us to do that but if we get an injunction and we said the
injunction and they go, one month later they come back. So what is
the point? I thought this was the secret, quotas a one off cost to us.
Kieron Armstrong claims there have been as many as 13 caravans on his
car park   plus trucks and cars. Today there were only four caravans.
A traveller told us the gates were open when they arrived. It wasn't
us. It was already open when we came here. Why do you feel the need
to be here? Because they won't give us anywhere to go. Be cos if you
had council site should be able to go somewhere else? The Yes. In fact,
Derbyshire County Council has four traveller sites, three puplicly
owned and one privately owned. Derbyshire Police say they've
received several reports of travellers at Armstrongs Mill
between September 13th and 15th. Four men were arrested on suspicion
of causing criminal damage   police investigations are still going on.
A man who starved four dogs to death has been banned for life from
keeping animals and given a 90 day suspended prison sentence. Martin
Carr kept the greyhounds in appalling conditions locked inside
a garage in Grantham. They went without food and water for three
weeks. Today Carr was told never to go near animals again. You may find
some of the images in Quentin Rayner's report distressing.
Martin Carr admitted committing the cruelty at a property which is a
stone's throw from Grantham Magistrates Court, where he
appeared today. In March this year, several greyhounds were found in a
heavily padlocked garage, in pens which were five foot square. The
conditions were atrocious. Four emaciated dogs were found lying
dead on a floor covered in faeces and urine. The animals hadn't been
fed or watered for up to three weeks. Two other emaciated dogs
were found alive and rescued and are recovering. Seven puppies were
also saved. The District Judge challenged Carr, why did you let
the dogs die in front of your eyes? Carr replied, I couldn't see them
dying. I can't forgive myself. The judge accepted that an ongoing
distressing court case involving another family member may have
clouded Carr's judgment and it was for this reason that he missed
going to prison by the skin of his teeth. The RSPCA had up visited
Carr on at least for Mike earlier occasions but he refused their
offer of rehousing many of the docks. Neighbours accused your
priorities of not acting quickly enough. Living next to 20 greyhound
with people not clearing up after them, at the smell was appalling
all the time and I reported that fact to the RSPCA and environmental
health and their response was very poor. They came round once and said
they were going to monitor the situation and completely failed to
do so. At the time, the docks were perfectly OK. We have to act within
the law. If someone makes an allegation, we have to see it
ourselves. Offences had not been committed to last time that we
visited. Carr's partner admitted two cruelty charges and was also
effectively banned from life from keeping animals. Carr was also
ordered to do 100 hours of committee work and warned not to
risk prison for a buyer for keeping animals again. Still ahead on
tonight's programme. The Hollywood star finding out the truth about
the Holocaust. Next, News this evening that
Nottinghamshire's Chief Constable's stepping down. Julia Hodson will
retire next year and her replacement Is likely to be named
in December. Our social affairs correspondent, Jeremy Ball, is at
Nottinghamshire's police headquarters. Why is she going?
Well, Julia Hodson's only in her mid fifties, so it might sound
surprising. But when she goes next September, she will have served 30
years in the police. And that could have made it pretty difficult to
stay. Because her force is making all its officers retire after 30
years to help deal with those huge budget cuts. She says she's
announcing his decision now to head off any speculation. Julia Hodson's
been in the job for just over three years. It's been a pretty tough
role, hasn't it? Yes. She's led the force through a choppy few years.
Julia Hodson's had to tackle one of the country's highest crime rates.
And she steered the force through a turbulent few months when it was
rated as the worst in the country. That prompted Ms Hodson to replace
her top management team. Her new deputy, Chris Eyre, used to be the
scting chief of the Leicestershire Force. He's likely to be a front
runner when her replacement's recruited later this year. We'll
hear who's taking over before the end of this year. And whoever it is,
they're still going to face some huge challenges.
Almost 3,000 people have taken part in a public consultation on plans
to close 15 Nottinghamshire police stations. Just over half the people
disagreed with the proposals, which would see front counters at police
stations shut down. Nottinghamshire Police are expected to respond to
the findings next month. Fire crews from Derbyshire spent
the morning tackling a fire at a disused bingo hall. Five fire
engines were called to the Empire on Station Road in Shirebrook at
around 6am. The fire is now under control. Derbyshire Fire and Rescue
say they don't yet know what the cause was.
Workers at the British Sugar plant in Newark are to be balloted on
industrial action. A 3.5% pay increase was rejected by their
union. Unite is consulting 250 members on a strike. The company
says the offer is "fair and reasonable" in the current economic
climate. Scientists in the East Midlands say
lives, and millions of pounds, could be saved with a simple blood
test. It may seem surprising, but an estimated 40% of heart patients
forget or don't bother to take the drugs they need to keep them alive.
It's hoped the tests could change all that. Simon Ward reports.
Prevention is better than cure. But it seems many patients, at risk of
serious heart conditions, aren't careful enough when it comes to
taking the prescribed medication. Denise suffers from high
cholesterol. She takes drugs to reduce the problem, but there was a
time when she didn't take them regularly. To begin with, when I
first went on it, because it did not have symptoms, I did not take
them regularly. Because I have diabetes as well, I started to get
the symptoms so I started to take them properly and I have noticed a
level coming right down. Denise is not alone. It's estimated that 40%
of patients ignore or don't take their drugs in the right amounts. A
simple blood spot test, developed at De Montfort University, could
monitor the levels of medication. But why not simply ask the patient?
If you were prescribed a drug end you were not taking it, would you
tell your GP if you started feeling ill or would you believe the GP to
wonder whether he had got the prescription right, and what would
he do? The aim is to get the right answer to help the patient. Trials
are due to take place at the Hockley Farm Medical Practice in
Leicester. If the patients are not taking the tablets regularly there
is a high risk of them having further heart attacks. This would
mean we can test whether they are taking the medications and it's not
we can ask them to comply more and there would hopefully reduce the
number of heart attacks and in the long term save money for the NHS.
If the trials are successful, the blood spot test could be used
around the UK, even by patients themselves, to make sure they're
keeping their hearts healthy. A multi million pound revamp of
Leicester's train station will go ahead despite criticism today from
the City's Civic Society. The group claims the changes to the station
are unworkable and it's worried about the impact they will have on
the historic forecourt building. But Network Rail says the plans
will improve the station and make it a welcoming entrance to the city.
It's looking increasingly likely that the AstraZeneca site in
Loughborough will be left empty when the firm leaves at the end of
the year. So far no one's agreed to take on the site off Bakewell Road
in the town. That's despite efforts by the current owners and a working
party of local authorities to attract new business there.
Next   a disease that affects tens of thousands of people across the
East Midlands, and which is likely to affect tens of thousands more in
the future. Today is World Alzheimer's Day, when charities
hope to raise awareness of the disease and boost the support
available to sufferers. Tom Brown has been to Leicester to meet one
family whose lives have been changed by dementia.
Three generations, all of their lives changed by one disease.
Marie's husband, Wes, suffers from Alzheimer's. He was diagnosed a
year and a half ago but since then his condition has severely worsened.
Now he can't leave his bed and requires constant help and support.
It was like being with a stranger because he has gone, hasn't he? But,
you get over these things. He is just getting worse. We have been
together a long while and I know that if it were me, he would do the
same for me. But Marie isn't alone. On Sunday her daughter Bea joined
dozens of people at a Memory Walk in Leicester, organised by the
Alzheimer's Society. And everyone had their own reason as to why they
were there. Dementia is a condition that devastates lives and rocks
people of their life and robs people of the memory of those who
love to them. In many cases, policeman starts a long time before
death occurs.    bereavement. in the East Midlands, more than
21,000 people are diagnosed with dementia. A number estimated to
double in the next 30 years. Now the Government has just announced
�10 million of extra funding for NHS memory services. Marie's
relationship with her husband may have changed, but her level of care
certainly won't. I had been down before, I get up. I understand
people they cannot do that, everybody is not the same. But I
just keep going, and that is the end of that.
And on our programme at 10.25 tonight, we'll be hearing from Paul
Dunnery, who works at the Alzheimer's Society. He'll be live
in the studio. A lady who can only be described as
an international superstar arrived in our patch today. Best known for
her singing, she's here at the moment to support the Holocaust
Centre and a special event in celebration of all those who show
active humanity when it would be easier to be a bystander. I was
lucky enough to hot foot it up to Laxton, outside Newark, to meet the
legend that is Liza Minnelli. The piece of the memorial gardens
up a Holocaust centre in Nottinghamshire, was ever so
slightly shattered today by the arrival of Liza Minnelli. She will
be starring at a special fundraiser for the centre the Sunday in London,
but this was her first visit. I had a lady here at the moment. It is
lovely to meet you. What are your impressions of the centre? It is
amazing. You come in and you say, what a lucky place, it is just
beautiful. After the first thing that happens, you are in shock.
seems that she surprised not just the fish but the visiting students.
I did not expect her to be here! just expected it to be a normal
school trip. Are you able to let us in on any of your plans for the
ball on the 25th? I am just going to do the best job I can. I assume
that means a bit of singing. Yes. Any song in particular? Yes. Once
on that is interesting after all this, it is cabaret. So many people
said the commoners will take over, this and that, and then the Nazis
struck in there. It is very relevant. I was born in 1946, so
people were still talking and I remember it so vividly. The horror
that everybody still felt at what had been done. A on a lighter note,
what plans to you have? Is there anything left to do because you
have done so much. Everything. Plus are obliged do everything I didn't
do it better! Thank you very much. And then she was off, chatting to
the students, passionate about or she had seen at the centre, things
that she said must never be forgotten.
She genuinely seems a lovely lady. She was, and she was tiny. Yours
expect these people to be bigger! Still to come on the programme  
back pedalling on bicycle design. Once they were all the rage, and
now it seems the penny farthing is making a bit of a comeback.
First, we have the sport. Nottingham Forest may be out of the
Carling Cup, but the manager says some pride has been restored. The
game with Premier League Newcastle was a cracker, which went down to
the last minute of extra time. Mark Shardlow was there.
Back at the City Ground, just three days after the Derby defeat  
feelings were still raw. I don't want to watch us get battered.
don't think the manager is the right manager. He's got no passion
there in the team. I don't think it's the manager, I think is the
board, they are not backing the manager. Give us time, we will sort
it out. It is the same team virtually as last year with a few
extras so the team is stronger so we need time for them to knit
together. Don't panic. Captain Luke Chambers made a mad dash to make
the subs bench   two hours earlier, he'd seen his partner give birth to
a baby boy. The opening goal was a delight   but to Newcastle. Ben
Arfa and Marveaux provided the cross field balls, Lovenkrands the
header. Forest were fighting   and just 47 seconds into the second
half were level through Findlay. But Newcastle were soon back in
front   a penalty awarded for holding back   Lovenkrands again on
target. Yet Forest weren't going to give in. They were playing a more
attacking game than at the weekend and their pressure was rewarded
with an equaliser from Matt Derbyshire. So to extra time   just
three minutes in and a mishit cross fooled Lee Camp   Forest had to
come back again. Joel Lynch was a fraction away with a header, but
time was running out. Then sub Ishmael Miller forced his way
through the defence to find an unmarked Marcus Tudgay. The crowd
was all set for penalties, when Newcastle's captain, Coloccini,
scored in the dying moments. Yet, in defeat, some pride. Absolutely.
We showed what we are capable of doing. We are not going to win the
calming cup but the main thing was restoring pride after Saturday.
Only 8,000 Forest fans were there to watch it, but they were
encouraged by what they saw. Sadly, bad news for Chris Cohen,
though, the Forest player who was hurt during the game with Derby on
Saturday. He was down injured when Derby scored their equaliser. Scans
have revealed a cruciate knee ligament problem that will keep him
out for the rest of the season. Forest have however confirmed they
will sign Clint Hill from Queens Park Rangers as cover.
Staying in the Championship, and Leicester City have extended the
contract of their popular defender Sol Bamba. He's now signed up until
2014. Tonight, Leicester City are at
Cardiff in the Carling Cup. There's live commentary on BBC Radio
Leicester 104.9 FM. And we'll have highlights tomorrow night.
On to cricket, and Leicestershire are out of the Twenty20 Champions
League. They needed a big win today to move into the next round. And
they got off to a great start. But the Sri Lankan champions Ruhunu
recovered to make 160 for 6. After yesterday's trouncing,
Leicestershire needed not just a win, but a convincing win to give
them a chance of progress. And for a time they were flying and looking
good. But they lost wickets in the run chase. This the final innings
for the retiring Paul Nixon. Leicestershire collapsed.and were
left needing six off the last ball to win. They didn't make it. And so
that's it for the Champions League. Poor Leicestershire   massive
achievement getting there, though. Now it's the time of year when we
ask for you to nominate your Sports Unsung Hero. We want someone from
the East Midlands who helps others take part in sport. Someone who
goes that extra mile to make a big difference. The awards recognise
people like our 2011 winner, Liz Broomhead, who's spent 43 years
developing netball in the region   devoting 60 hours a week to the
sport. We're also looking for the likes of Ron Collins, who's run
junior football clubs in Aylestone for 16 years, introducing a
disability section. It doesn't matter which sport they are
involved with, we just want to hear about the people who go the extra
mile where you live   they deserve to shine once in a while, don't
they? Of course they do. Nominations
close at midnight on the 30th of October. You can get an entry form
and all the details from www.bbc.co.uk/sportsunsunghero. If
you're not on the web you can call 0845 308 8000 to get a form. They
were thought to have been consigned to history. But now, after more
than 100 years, the first production line penny farthings are
being built again in Leicester. It seems as more people opt for two
wheels some of the more adventurous among us are looking for something
a little different. Anthony Bartram reports.
Men take part in a series of competitions on any partings.
they do not make them like they used to. Or at least, they did not
used to. For the first time in more than a century these machines are
back on the production line in Leicester. Roger Lovell has raced
and ridden penny farthings for years. People ask me how do you
write it, can I have a go, would you buy them from? We just got such
a demand that we decided we would stop making them. He runs a not 
for profit business which repairs bikes and modified them for
Disabled Riders. There is a strong link to the past year as the
workshop is on the same site as the old West the cycle company. Its
modern cycles rode the ordinary, as they were known, off the road
before the turn of the century. Roger is used to getting on his
bike and has found help around the corner. Making the new penny
farthing and all English affair. is cold fashioned, but it is nice
to know that somebody still makes the old fashioned penny farthing
bikes. In the past, these museum pieces have been used as a novelty
act to encourage more people on to two wheels. But with three organise
penny farthing races being held every year in the UK, demand for
them is pretty high, compared to the numbers they can produce. Be
warned, you will have to be patient, because the first patch is already
sold out.    first batch. It is as the folding of bit, isn't

Nottinghamshire. Before then, the skies clearing again overnight.
Just light to moderate south  westerly winds. It means we will
have quite a good start tomorrow. A bright start with the early morning

week weather front working towards us. Starting to cloud over for the
afternoon period and produce perhaps the odd bit of rain into
the afternoon. Most of us escaping with a dry day. Temperatures
reaching a maximum of 17 or 18 Celsius. We had the ridge of high
pressure still around on Friday. But the majority of it is sitting
to the south east. It will keep us reasonably settled on Friday. Quite
a nice day in store. Temperatures also gradually increasing. Possibly
quite warm over the weekend, being a lot better in the sunshine. Pays
