Oh! Is it that time already?
Well, let's get on with it, and let's go bargain hunting! Yeah!
Peterborough is the burial place of two queens   the first,
Queen Catherine of Aragon, who was married to Henry VIII,
the second, Queen Mary of Scots, who was executed
Hopefully, today, our teams are going to be making history
Here's a quick peek at what's coming up.
Today, our search for spiritual enlightenment hits some turbulence.
Oh!
And they may have to make some sacrifices.
Big purchase, big risk.
Each team gets £300 and an hour to shop for three items,
which they sell later at auction.
The team wins that makes the most profit or the least loss.
Got it?
Before all of that, let's meet the teams.
Today, we've got two teams of pals. Well, they are pals at the moment.
For the Reds, we've got Karen and Emma.
And for the Blues, we've got Paul and Chris. Welcome and hello.
  Hello.
  Hello.
  Very nice to see you.
  So, Karen, where did you two girls meet?
  We met at a party
about 13 years ago.
And we have just been laughing and giggling ever since.
  Must have been a heck of a good party.
  It was.
  Lovely.
  And your into genealogy?
  Yes. Big time.
  Tell us about that.
  I have been into it for about 25 years.
When I started, it was all, you had to write letters,
it wasn't on the Internet.
  Yes, go to the County records office, all that boring stuff.
  Yeah.
  But now you can find it out easily.
  Yeah, ten minutes.
  Yeah.
  What have you found out?
  I've got Ozzy Osbourne in my tree.
  Have you?
  Yes.
  Have you really?
  Really.
So, how close a relation is Ozzy Osbourne?
He's... My grandad's great uncle married Ozzy's granny's sister.
  Never!
  Really.
And do you think you've picked up many of your traits through this?
  Bats.
  You like bats?
  I love bats.
  Do you?
  Do you ever go round the belfries looking for bats?
  No.
  Do you go out at night looking for them swooping around?
  No.
  It says hear you like Gothic fashion and you like music.
  Yeah.
It starts really with the music, and then you get into the fashion,
the lifestyle and everything that goes with it, really.
So, what will you girls be looking out for today?
I think we're going to go for a bit of Art Deco, Art Nouveau.
A bit of silver. Anything a bit weird.
  Are you going to blow the lot?
  Yeah.
  Of course.
  Every single penny?
We'll leave him a little bit.
OK, well, good fun and very nice to talk to you.
Now, boys, you'll be quaking in your boots
with all this Gothicism going on.
  Yeah.
  So, where did you two meet?
We're both in the control tower at RAF Coningsby.
But are in the RAF or are you not in the RAF?
No, I was in the RAF for 25 years.
And I've now left. I'm a civil servant and I work for the RAF now,
  doing the same sort of job.
  Doing the same sort of thing.
Well, it's always incredibly reassuring for us whizzing along
in the air to know that you're down there, somebody is down there.
  Hopefully, paying attention.
  Yeah, quite. And, Chris,
  what is your nickname at work, then?
  Civisure.
  Civisure?
  You've never been in the RAF?
  No, I haven't.
  So, you're always then a civi.
  Yes.
Chris, I understand you like looking for bargains.
Yeah, I like looking around car boots.
What sort of things do you go for when you go on shopping expeditions?
Look for silver stuff, gold stuff, jewellery,
a little bit of Moorcroft.
Oh, dear, the Goths here aren't liking the sound of this
one little bit.
They have nothing to worry about, don't worry.
  Nothing Gothic, though?
  Not yet, no.
  What are the tactics going to be, then?
  To win.
  Buy cheap, sell high.
Ah, there we are! You've watched the programme before!
  Thank you.
  Your money moment.
You know the rules, your experts await. And, off you go!
And very, very, very good luck. Gosh, what lovely teams.
So, who will be helping our teams today?
On the look out for the Reds is Thomas Plant.
Whilst Charlie Ross tries to herald in the profits for the Blues.
This way for mega profits!
OK, teams, time to get shopping!
I know you two are sort of purveyors of the dark arts, are you?
The dark side, yes.
  What do you do?
  We work in air traffic.
Air traffic! And here you are looking for antiques.
We like it, we think other people will like it.
Things a bit off the wall, a bit strange.
There are other strange people.
  We've got 300 quid.
  Yeah, and three items we need to get
and we'll leave you a fiver to buy something good at the end.
Well, come on, let's go to it and let's try and find
something wonderful.
I think we need to get buying. Come on, chocks away!
That's lift off!
Time to give the throttle some welling. In no time at all,
the Blues have gone supersonic!
Here we go, guys.
  Ever have one of those at Coningsby?
  No!
  No, no.
I think that's a fantastic bit of kit, isn't it?
  I take it is a Concorde.
  It is.
  Yes.
  Is that nose the way it should be?
Yeah. During flight, it was ported up and as it came in or slowed down,
  it would drop down for the landing.
  I see.
  That's got no price on it at all.
  No, we need to know, don't we?
Excuse me, madam.
  How much is your Concorde?
  That's a bit steep.
  Yeah, it's a third of our budget...
  Yeah, that's a lot.
  ..on one item.
I'll tell you what we'll do,
shall we send Chris over to have a word with the owner?
Chris, you go off and have a quiet word with the owner
and come back with what you can do. See what you can do.
  Right, leave it with me.
  See you in a minute.
  Keep it hush hush, eh?
Do you bring good tidings?
Well, the lady is waiting for her husband at the moment,
whose vehicle's broke down. So, she wants to have a word with him first.
Perhaps if we mended his car for nothing,
we could have the plane free?
The fan belt is gone. So, have you got a pair of tights on you?
  We could make a temporary one.
  Has he got a pair of tights?
  You hadn't told me about this. Shall we pop back in a minute?
  I think so.
I like that, good.
Come on, Carlota,
I can see you in a pair of fishnets.
So, while the chaps have a good line of sight,
the girls are heading for the dark side.
  Black jewellery to reflect your... The blacker the better?
  Yes.
  So, this is a piece of pressed horn.
  How would they make that?
Cattle horn or sheep horn.
It can be heated up and then it is pressed into a mould.
Of course, it's a hand with a swag of roses. Look at the fingernail,
  beautifully done, on this lace cuff.
  Would that be English?
  Most definitely. For our market.
  That is impressive.
  Yeah.
This is a watch chain, which a gentleman
  would have worn in mourning.
  That's lovely.
  That is pretty.
This is going to be a bog oak, this one here. These bits carved.
So, that would be carved out of the wood?
Yes, this is carved out of wood.
And then these are metal beads, steel beads.
And then you've got the piece again carved. This is jet, this one here.
And how old would that be?
  It's going to be 1860s.
  I like the watchband.
  Yeah.
I like the brooch, though, as well.
  It's beautiful.
  None of them are marked as for prices.
  Yeah.
  That's so I can...
  Make it up as he goes along.
  Oh!
  60, 40, 125. And your very best is those prices or...?
  Yeah.
  Go on, we like Whittinger and we like black stuff.
  Look at them.
35, 50, 115. I can't go below that. 115.
  In...
  I think the brooch would do quite well.
  Yeah.
  At 45, I'd...
  No.
  Really?
  Really, yeah.
  Girls, does that fulfil your wish?
  Yes.
  I absolutely love it.
  And if we buy it for greed, it's good.
  How much is it again? £50.
  I would take it.
  Yeah.
  I think we'll have that.
50 nicker!
Rock on, Reds! But the Blues seem to be deviating somewhat.
  Here we are, lots of swords, guns.
  Yeah. Fantastic.
There's a nice box there on top of that table.
  A little writing slope?
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
  You've spotted that, chaps, what can you tell me about it?
  It looks nice.
  Yep. What date is it?
  I don't know.
  It's Victorian.
  Victorian?
  Yep.
It's probably 1870, 1880.
  Right.
  This is walnut.
  Right.
And it's inlayed with all sorts of woods.
The greenish wood is olive wood.
The black is ebony.
And it's boxwood strung with boxwood.
It's got all sorts of specimen woods in there,
which makes it particularly nice.
What would it make at auction?
Because it's got a nice top, in that condition,
it probably, at auction, on a good day, 30 quid, probably.
It's 30.
That's put us right in a dilemma, hasn't it?
I don't think it's an untoward price to be asking.
I think the gentleman is being very fair with it,
but are we going to see a profit in it? Marginal.
It will always make 20 and it will usually make 25.
It could make 40, but I don't think there's much above that.
Worth just bearing it in mind?
  Is there any movement at all?
  25, that's it.
  Oh!
  Then that's it.
  Yeah, I think so.
  Do you want to buy it, guys?
  I do.
  I think so.
You've done the business. You've seen it, we've bought it.
Nothing can go wrong!
Let's hope that doesn't come back to bite you on the derriere.
So, we're 20 minutes in
and time Thomas gave the whole Goth thing a whirl.
  Nice.
  No?
What about this rather attractive '60s sort of smoking jacket?
Yes, Tom, definitely more your style.
  I can imagine myself in my boudoir.
  Yeah.
  You'd have to be quite skinny.
Well, all right, don't rub it in.
Let's not mention that again.
I try my best.
These experts, what are they like!
He keeps getting accosted. He's very famous, you know.
Wait, fellas! Wait! Wait!
Come on, chaps, now is not the time to be breaking formation.
  Well.
  What about these?
  No.
If you want to go for cocktails, girls, if you like cocktails...
Yeah, I looked at that. I like mixology.
There you are. This is the height of the cocktail period. It's 1950s.
  Oh, it's funny, it's by Gucci.
  Really?
It's a Gucci! That is so cool.
The only thing I don't like about it are the tongs.
I can't see them being part of it.
Everything else, I can.
It's dead cool, it's dead funny. It's very London.
Oh, look at these cherries. And they're red!
  Do you like that?
  I do like it, yeah.
Girls, I'll let you into a secret, I'm a martini drinker, what are you?
Cosmopolitan.
  Both of you. Who's the mixer?
  It's me!
  Are you good?
I love my mixology, yeah. I'd like to do a course in it, really.
From the items we bought on Bargain Hunt,
  maybe you can invest in a course.
  Maybe I could.
It's £95, do you want me to have a conversation?
  Yeah. Should we?
  Yes.
These don't really... These are a sort of marriage, aren't they?
  Yeah, the tongs are.
  The tongs are the only marriage.
  Yes.
  What can you do?
  Could you do a bit more?
  I'll go to 70. I can't go less than 70.
You can't do 60?
  Are you sure it can't be 65?
  No.
  Yeah.
  What do you think?
  I like it.
  I like it.
  It's a deal, then.
  Thank you very much.
  You're welcome.
Well done, Reds.
I'm sure you could mix up something bewitching with those.
Do you know? I reckon, looking at her, if we had had her,
we'd have won the war by about 1942, frankly.
Cool down, chaps! And they're not the only ones needing refreshment.
I think we could do with a Cosmopolitan.
  Yes, definitely!
  Yes.
Items still need to be truffled out.
Good job, the Blues are going for the jugular.
This is the cranberry glass jug.
Now, I suspect it is quite a lot of money
because it's a particularly nice thing with a silver plated top.
I would be very surprised if it's not £150, really.
I mean, if you bought that for very little,
I would be all for buying it.
  Worth asking?
  We'll see how we get. I love this. His trademark.
"Leave it with me, guv'nor."
Yeah, see what you can do, Christophe.
What's the verdict?
He had it for 85, got him down to 65, and that is his absolute best.
I can tell by your reaction, that must be a good buy, then.
  What do you reckon?
  Give him the 65 quid.
  Right.
  Well done!
We got an antique!
And I'm an antique, too!
Great! That leaves both teams with only one item left to buy,
but they better get a shufty on as there are only 15 minutes left.
Wait a minute, have those Goths seen the light?
  That's different.
  It is. Look how it catches the light.
It does. Mother of pearl really does catch the light very well.
£26, bit of a bargain, really.
  But I don't think it'll make much at the auction.
  No.
  It's quite nice, though.
  Hey!
Can I just borrow that for a mo? I think I might need it.
Gosh, how scary is this?
Look at that carved mask.
And those staring eyes
and the odd ball incrustations of muck
all the way around this wood carving.
It's got a wee label on the back that says tete Bulu.
That's because the Bulu are a West African tribe
in a French speaking territory.
This is called a fetish head.
They believe that the gorilla and the chimpanzee can be inhabited
by the spirit of their human ancestors.
And in a Bulu ceremony,
it's an object that could have all sorts of substances applied to it.
It's been around, perhaps, for 100 years plus.
What's it worth?
Well, today, on a stall here in Peterborough,
it could be yours for £200.
What might it be worth in an ethnographic sale?
I see it making the top end of £800 to £1,000.
Wow!
Although The Enlightened One might find making such large
profits somewhat questionable.
  The four faces of Buddha.
  Oh, right.
Or is it the four faces of my opponent?
Do you think it could be?
It would be insulting to offer you £70 for this, wouldn't it?
You would probably hit me.
No, I wouldn't hit you. I'd ask you for 95.
Oh! Oh!
My joystick was wobbling there.
Gosh, that is so tempting.
See if you can get it for 75 quid. Go on, off you go.
I will try.
I noticed it's got some edge. It's 20th century.
  No less than that?
  I've gone from 145 to 95, so...
Have you done the deal with that delightful lady?
Look, she's smiling at me!
  I haven't done any deal.
  No, but what have you...?
She can't go any lower than 95.
  She's already dropped it 40 quid.
  I'll tell you what, guys.
Put it back on the shelf and we'll have a look at the Concorde.
That's well worth thinking about if we can't get the right price
on the Concorde. How far is the Concorde away?
  Is it about a two minute sprint?
  Yes.
  So, we could have a zippy finish.
  We have time.
My darling, I love that.
You know where I want to be on that and we're nearly there,
but I might see you later.
We know, mum's the word.
But you better fly like the wind, there're less than ten minutes left.
  What did the lady say originally, 100 quid?
  One item.
  Big rush.
  Big rush. Let's get looking.
Thomas, this might be a good time to appeal to the girls' softer sides.
Girls, those Doulton pieces are lovely.
  They're vases.
  These ones?
  No, these here.
  Gorgeous bits of Art Nouveau.
  They're nice.
  They're different.
  Nice colour.
  Really nice, aren't they?
But they're £170 the pair.
  Oh! Ouch.
  But they're perfect.
  Are they collectible?
  They are quite collectible.
They're rather attractive with that sort of floral design.
  They would look nice anywhere, even today, wouldn't they?
  Yeah.
  I really like them.
  I do. I love the pattern.
I like the colours.
This mottling here is the glaze, the mixture of the green...
This would be mainly an ash glaze because of the green in it.
Then you've got this brown, which is going to be an iron glaze.
And these stylized flower heads with these little leaves.
It's just absolutely so Art Nouveau.
  Are they honesty flowers?
  Could be. You certainly see those.
You're good on your flowers, aren't you?
  What would you take?
  Go on, a little bit less.
  I'll go to 145.
Big purchase, big risk, we've got no time left. They're good, clean bits.
  I think they're beautiful.
  We would make
  a profit on those?
  You've got a good chance.
They're perfect, they're Doulton and Art Nouveau.
I think we might go for them.
  Is that all right?
  Yep. 145.
  Yep. Sold.
  You're a star, an absolute star.
  Beautiful!
  You spent all your money, that's your three items!
  Yay!
Yes, well done! No shrinking violets here.
But now we're into the final countdown.
Can this aviation nut find another chance to make a profit?
All right, guys, it's still there.
  Could you do that for £75?
  I wouldn't like to do it for that.
  We need them to get together, really.
  We could come together.
75 sounds a nice, sort of Scottish figure, really.
  I'll do £80 and that's it.
  All right.
  What do you think?
  I'm now stepping out of this.
  That's a bit different, isn't it?
  It's an eye catcher.
  It is.
  Yeah, £80?
  Yeah.
  Yeah?
  Well done, guys!
I'm glad you took the decision out of my hands
because I did not know what to do. So, if that makes 30 quid,
I can say, "You should have bought the Buddha." If it makes 200 quid,
I'll say, "I told you so."
  Win win situation.
  Win win. Brilliant!
Well, let's go and see what old Thomas has bought, shall we?
  Great. Come on.
  Thank you.
  Thank you, sir.
Glad to see you're not shirking your responsibilities, Charles,
and stop stealing my lines.
Let's fly, let's fly...
That's it, time's up.
But before we cut off their purchases,
let's check out what the Red Team bought.
Karen and Emma looked to the dark side for inspiration
and fell under the spell of this black brooch for £50.
Then, they were shaken and stirred by this 1950s
silver plated cocktail set, £70 paid.
And in the final moments, they settled for these Edwardian
Royal Doulton vases, lavishing £145 on them.
There's a lot of giggling going on here. Loads of giggling.
  Don't tell me you've finished?
  We have.
  You never have!
  Yes.
  And we spent it all. Have you?
  No.
What have you spent?
  Right. 145.
  And 50, that's 195.
  And 70.
  Yeah, 70.
Did I say 195? And 70, 265. I want £35 of leftover lolly, please.
I'll take that from you. £35. Because that goes to T Plant.
  £35. Which thing is going to bring the biggest profit?
  Those.
The brooch.
The brooch. We have a disagreement.
  We'll find out in a minute, won't we?
  Yes.
Now, let's check out what the Blue Team bought, eh?
Paulo and Christophe spotted this Victorian writing slope
and, with a nudge, paid £25 for it.
Charlie twisted their arm into buying
this Victorian claret jug, which they poured £65 into.
We'll see how we go. I love this, it's his trademark.
Finally, with no waste of time, they landed this model Concorde.
Let's hope it soars above the £80 paid.
  Nobody went by plane, did they?
  No.
  Very sensible.
  So, had a good time then?
  Brilliant.
  Is he not an amusing man?
  Very amusing.
  Very off the wall and droll, I'd say.
Fitting in a treat. Anyway, which is your favourite piece, Chris?
The cranberry jug.
Would you agree with that, Paul?
No, I quite like the Concorde that we bought.
I think that's going to go well.
I can't imagine why.
I suppose because it's Mach 2 or something like that.
  So, what did you spend overall?
170, so you've got 130 about your person?
Somewhere? You don't like handing this over,
do you, Chris? Not one little bit.
£130 goes straight over to Carlota.
  Thank you very much.
  Good luck, chaps.
Meanwhile, I'm heading off to Exeter, to Exeter Museum.
Can you imagine what bliss?
The Royal Albert Memorial Museum, in Exeter,
attracts thousands of visitors every year from all over the globe.
And located as it is in the heart of the West Country,
the museum doesn't ignore the local naval heritage from the days
when British ships travelled to new and faraway lands.
This part of the museum celebrates the diversity of the world cultures,
with amazing exhibits, some of which come from West Country donors.
Extraordinary. Some of the exhibits are quite innocuous looking.
Take this little section of metal.
It is a thin piece of copper sheathing.
An interesting thing is the paper label on it, written in pen and ink.
Look, it says Pitcairn Isle copper from the old Bounty.
Now, we have all seen the movie, you know how it worked.
Captain Bligh, HMS Bounty,
the fact that he got kicked out with some loyal, old crew members
and the vessel eventually was destroyed
at the Island of Pitcairn by the mutineers.
But look at this,
this is a piece of the copper that wrapped the bottom of that vessel.
That piece of copper came off Captain Bligh's ship.
This display,
including an extraordinary Tahitian funerary garb,
came from Bligh's next voyage,
where his nephew, a Lieutenant Bond,
was presented with this mourning garb by the islanders.
It was a mark of prestige.
And this thing would be worn by the chief mourner at a funeral.
What I like is this string vest. Look at that.
It is made up of thousands of little shards of mother of pearl
that have been cut and strung,
so that they move every time the human inside
does a bit of a jink. And in the brilliant sunshine,
would have been seriously dazzling.
Take that headdress.
That's a peacock type rather, I mean, and avian feather.
That is seriously weird.
Another West Country mariner who endowed the collections here
was one James Woodward Scott,
who set off as an 11 year old midshipman on HMS Discovery
in 1791.
And in his travels up the West American
and Canadian coast,
all the way up to Alaska, he started to collect native objects,
as an 11 year old, which is extraordinary.
These two teeth come from a bear.
We have heard about the rarity of hens' teeth.
Well, here we've got bears' teeth.
This one is carved with a wolf, which was important ceremonially
in terms of winter festivities and also to assist healing.
Amazing, isn't it? From an 11 year old.
Of course, they never found the Northwest passage.
Which reminds me,
are our teams today going to find their passage to the auction room?
Well, we have crossed the County line from Cambridgeshire to Essex,
at Sworders Sale Room with John Black,
our auctioneer today. John. For Karen and Emma today,
they are so excited about their pressed horn Victorian brooch.
What do you make of that?
It is a charming brooch of a hand clutching some flowers,
  but I don't think it is pressed horn. It's probably vulcanite.
  Oh!
  And vulcanite is a sort of plastic?
  It is a rubber composite, yes.
  Which is a nice way of saying a type of plastic.
  That's right.
  And they would be worth ten to £15.
  Each?
  Yes.
On a good day. £50 paid on that.
  How do you rate Gucci here?
  We rate Gucci if it's Italian.
  This, unfortunately, is made in England.
  No!
  Hm mm.
  Really?
  Yes.
  Well, they've had a good go, haven't they?
  There are lots of bits there.
  That's right. £80 to £100.
We think it is useful.
Yeah, good. That's a very nice estimate. Thank you. Very positive.
£70 paid.
  Good.
  So, we're happy with that.
Next is the staple of the sale room, a pair of Doulton vases.
There we go, John. Something for you to get your teeth into.
That's right. They are decorative stoneware. We see them a lot.
  £50 to £100.
  How much?
  £50 to £100.
  That is what I thought you said.
Our team invested £145. Oh, dear.
Well, out of this double tragedy today,
we're going to need the bonus buy. Let's go and have a look at it.
  Now, Karen, Ems, how are you, girls?
  We're fine, thank you.
  Are you?
£265 you've spent. I'm so proud of you girls!
£35 only went to Tom. Tom, what did you find?
  Well, I got something to reflect you two.
  Oh!
I thought you would like these. It's not the oldest thing
in the world. But I quite liked it
because I like the chain to it and the ankh.
I think that's like an Egyptian ankh, isn't it?
What is it made out of?
I wouldn't sort of dwell on that one, probably.
  How much?
  I spent it all.
It was marked at a lot more.
So, how well do you think it will do?
Well, maybe it's something which reflected you
and I just thought it would make you feel happy at the auction and maybe
it might make a small profit if there are other Goths in the room.
That's what you are banking on?
Well, that's what I'm banking on. But also, it is quite fashionable.
  Would you wear that?
  Yeah.
  You would?
  Yeah, that is pretty cool.
He's not predicting a big profit and, of course,
you don't have to take it.
It all depends on how you get on with your first three items.
But for the viewers at home,
let's find out what they auctioneer thinks about Tom's bit of jewellery.
Well, John, carrying on the jolly theme.
Thomas Plant has come up with something really tasty.
Yes.
A plastic Coptic cross.
  Not vulcanite?
  It isn't.
Unfortunately, it's just plastic this time.
And worth very, very little.
  Gosh.
  We have given this a very good estimate of £10 to £15.
Which means, if it doesn't go well, you'll be lucky
  if you get a pound for it.
  Exactly.
I know that translation. Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to put it around our in memoriam Victorian brooch
and that makes a bit of a set, doesn't it?
That is it for the Reds. Now, for the Blues.
And our first item in this extraordinary mixture
is the Tunbridge ware writing slope.
  Which is another staple, isn't it?
  It is, Tim.
£30 to £40 is all we have put.
It's...it's not in the best condition.
If you open it up, the writing slope is gone, it's loose.
It's hanging free. So, unfortunately,
that's why it's so little.
Well, don't despair, they only pay £25.
Thank goodness it's not made of vulcanite.
Next is the cranberry Victorian spiral mounted...claret jug?
I think it is a claret jug.
  It is not in the greatest condition. This is lose here.
  Oh, yes.
But we've thought about it long and hard
and given it an estimate of £35 to £45.
  Well, £65 paid.
  So, that's on the edge of edge.
  It is.
Now, prepare for takeoff with Concorde.
£20 to £30. You get the plaque, as well.
I don't do casting myself, but if I did,
  I think I could do a better job than this.
  Hm mm.
  Anyway, your estimate is how much again?
  20 to 30.
  They paid 80.
OK. Well, on that happy note, we're going to go and look
at the bonus by, because, by Jingo, they're going to need it.
Paul, Christophe, this is the moment you've been waiting for.
£130 went Carlos Ross. And, Carlos, what did you spend it on?
  Blow the lot?
  I spent a huge amount of money on this, boys.
I am passionate about this object.
  Right.
  You are not passionate about this object, but trust me, chaps,
this is the arts and crafts movement at its best.
This actually is a toffee tin for Bassett's Toffees. Stop it!
A toffee tin.
But it has got all the hallmarks of Archibald Knox, has it not?
  Oh, yes. Looks rusty to me.
  Wonderful hinges.
Enamelling here. Not real,
but simulating something that was absolutely wonderful.
And to think that you got this free with your toffees!
  And you just paid for it.
  How much did you spend?
  Give him a break.
  What is it worth, chaps?
  15 quid.
  Well, there you go.
  So there!
  Double your money time.
  Can I have a look?
  You may.
  Thank you.
  So, the big thing is, Charlie.
  Yeah.
In the world of tins, there's an infinite variety
and there are hundreds of pounds spent on certain rarities.
Oh, yeah. If that was in super condition,
and I don't pretend it is,
I think it would be worth the best part of £200.
  Well, it's not dented, is it?
  No.
  It's just a little...
Just a little rusted.
Anyway, let's find out what the auctioneer thinks
about Carlos's tin.
  Right, John, you're an arts and crafts man.
  Hm mm.
How would you date that casket?
That would be around 1900, 1910.
  And would they be very nice Ruskin porcelain plaques?
  They wouldn't.
  They'd be gobstopper type liquorice allsorts.
  Oh, right.
  Because that's what it held?
  That's right. A few little dinks and nicks.
The finish is nearly gone, as well, on this.
But £30 to £40 we've put on it.
Well, that genius Charlie Ross only paid £15.
So, if they go for the bonus buy, they could double their money.
And looking at Concorde, they're going to need to do it.
Anyway, we'll find out in a minute, won't we?
Now, Karen, Emma, you're on the edge, how does it feel?
  Nervous.
  Nerve racking.
What are you nervous about particularly, Karen?
  I like losing money.
  You like losing money?
And that makes you feel nervous?
  I'm a bit nervous because it's an auction.
  Yeah.
The cold, steely hand of reality is about to grip,
because your first item is the brooch, and here it comes.
There we are. Vulcanite brooch.
We'll start the bidding here at £10, then.
At £10.
  This is tough.
  Victorian memorial brooch. Vulcanite brooch there.
  £5 is bid, thank you.
Any advance at £5?
  Six, seven, eight.
  It's going.
  At £8, then.
Are we all done at £8?
Lady's bid again at £8.
All done, and I'm going to sell.
£8. Minus £42.
That's good.
Let's hope we make it up with the...
Cocktail set.
95. We have the 1950s silver plated cocktail set. It is marked Gucci.
But it is made in England. Who would like to bid £50 for it?
Man or lady who has everything? Cocktail set? 20 is bid, thank you.
At 22. 25.
  Good.
45. 50. Five.
  Five.
  Yes!
90. 100. And ten. 120.
That's cool!
120. Gentleman's bid standing.
£120. Are you sure? 130, sir?
  Is he finished?
  He looks again. No?
120, I'm going to sell. Standing there at 120.
Yes! Look how good that did!
That is brilliant. £120 is plus 50.
You were minus 42. You are back in the game with plus £8.
Now, your vases.
Hold on a minute,
  this has been placed on my... front of my feet.
  Anyway,
  here they come.
  They're Doulton, they're perfect.
Lot 96.
A pair of good Royal Doulton vases. £30 is the bid, sir.
  If you wish to bid. £30. Thank you, madam.
At 32.
Five. 60. Five.
70. Five. 80.
£80. 85, sir?
  Would you like to come in now?
  Oh, no! Come on!
Lady's bid at £80. Are we all done now?
Selling at £80.
£80 is minus 65, which is not so bad if you say it quickly.
  Which means, overall, you are minus 57.
  All right.
  I feel so responsible.
  What are we going to do about the old necklace?
We're going to go for it. Even for a penny,
  even for a pound.
  Just because it's black?
  Yes.
Well, all I can say is things are looking rather black at the moment.
  You are determined to do it?
  Yes.
We're going with the bonus buy, and here it comes.
Lot 100. The black plastic Coptic cross.
It is only black plastic, I'm afraid.
So, who would like to start the bidding here
at a generous £5?
  Generous?
  Generous five.
  Any bids now?
£5. It is on the counter. £5, thank you.
Another lady there. At £5. Would you like to bid six?
  Yes, she would.
  In the lovely coral necklace?
£6 is bid. Thank you very much.
Standby. Stand by your bids.
It is your big, madam. At £6.
The black plastic cross on the chain at £6, and I'm selling.
  £6 is minus £29. That's minus 86, girls.
  Oh!
Well, you said you got a thrill from losing money.
I think you have had a cheap thrill today.
I have had a very cheap thrill.
Anyway, the fact of the matter is it could be a winning score,
  so say not a word to the Blues.
  We won't.
  Lips are sealed.
  Lips are sealed.
  Well done, girls.
Carlos, you're been in the auction business for years.
You've seen some strange things happen in your time.
A lot of strange things.
Things like Concordes that you put £20 to £30 on.
And end up at 360 on the net.
I've yet to find anybody who rates that, I have to say.
He has put 20 to 30 on that
and £80 was paid. Well, good luck.
Now, team, first up is your Tunbridge writing slope,
and here it comes.
We move on to this Victorian walnut
writing slope with a Tunbridge inlaid band across the top.
We will start the bidding here at £20. It is a low start.
At £20 now. Any advance? £20.
  I'll take 22.
  Come on.
28. Lady's bid at the back there.
At £28. 30 if you wish. Anywhere else?
  You're in profit.
  It's the lady's bid.
  What's with all these women going for it?
Make no mistake, £28.
£28. Well done, chaps. £28 is plus £3.
Better than a kick.
Now, here we go with the claret jug.
Another good lot behind the counter.
  I think I steered you into this.
  ..claret jug.
Late Victorian, there.
We can start the bidding here at £30.
Again, it's a low start. At £30.
Any advance?
You need a bit of glue there, somewhere.
32, thank you. 35. 38.
42. £42 right at the back of the room. At £42.
  Are we all done?
  Come on!
45, thank you. 48.
£48. Far off there.
At £48, and I'll sell.
£48, two off 50, which means it's minus 17.
Which means overall you're minus 14.
And here we come with Concorde.
Moving on to the illustrious model of Concorde, there we are.
We can start the bidding at £35.
£35, straight in there.
In the room with Amy. At 35. 38. 40.
  I knew it would be good.
£48 there. 50.
At £50 now. Still with us here. At £50.
On commission now. Against you, sir, in the room.
Do you want to bid 52? Where are you?
Ducked away? At £50 then.
52. 55. One more, madam?
Yes? £58. There we are, commission is out. It's your bid.
At £58. And we'll sell.
22. 32. Minus 36. OK?
Minus £36.
Bearing in mind how flat as a pancake this has been,
  that's not too bad.
  No, not really.
So, what are you going to do about the toffee tin?
  We all fancy it.
  We liked it from the beginning.
  You liar!
  We said we were going to go with it.
Well, that's great, isn't it? The decision is made.
Now that you've decided,
I can tell you what the auctioneer has put on it.
He think it is a fab little tin and he has put £30 to £40.
  Really?
  So, in his view, you'll double your money.
Who would like to start the bidding here at £30.
£30 for this. 20, then?
Anywhere? Ten now?
We crawl it down to £10. Thank you, madam, at ten.
Is bid here, on my left. At £10 now. 12 there? 12.
14. 16. 18. At £18 now.
  Come on, keep going.
  Just.
  Tight.
  We all done now? At £18...
It is your bid, madam.
I'm going to sell. We are all done at £18.
£18. Well, that is very good.
  Plus £3. That's very good.
  Well done.
Not as good as his estimate, though.
I have to say. If he had made his 30 to 40, you'd be really smiling.
Anyway, it is plus three, no harm with that.
You are minus £33 as a result, and that could be a winning score.
Don't talk to the Reds and all will be revealed in a moment.
Been chatting at all between you?
No, not a word? Just as well, really.
We have had a whopping series of disasters and the team that
has had more disasters than anybody else are the Reds.
Yes!
  You also made the biggest profit, but the biggest losses.
  Yes!
They made a profit of £50 on their Gucci silver cocktail set.
  Which was good, wasn't it?
  Very good.
We had such great expectations as a result.
But sadly, they came to nought. They came to minus 86, actually.
Which is quite a whopper, isn't it? All in the name of good fun.
which is nothing to be too proud of, are the Blues.
Congratulations, chaps.
  Thank you.
  Your maximum profit was £3,
which you scored twice  
on the writing slope and that excellent toffee tin, Carlos,
which you can be very proud of.
Another three pound profit on that.
Old sticky fingers, you see.
  Anyway, had a good time?
  Fantastic.
  Very good.
Thank you very much for coming on the show.
Congratulations for winning.
In fact, join us soon for some more bargain hunting, yes?
Yes!
