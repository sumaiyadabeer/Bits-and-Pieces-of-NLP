I can make my world come true All my dreams will see me through
  It doesn't matter What may come my way...
  No! No!
Believe me now I will win some day.
  Oi! What did you do that for?
  It was an accident. Keep your wig on.
  There might be something from Cam.
  She's been in New York for ages.
Thinking of Tracy Beaker all the time she's there... As if!
Duke, he won't give me the milk.
Give Tracy the milk.
  He got milk all over me!
  Crash, for goodness sake!
You should take it out his pocket money when he smashes things.
Eugh! Sugar...
Ready now? Come on, boys, here we go.
Nathan...
  There's tonnes of washing to be done.
  I know.
  You'll get it done?
  Yeah.
  Good.
OK, Marco the wonder dog, drop the ball!
Marco! Bad dog! Bad dog!
Ah ah ah!
It's from New York!
Molly, why have you sent away for a free voucher for toilet cleaner?
  It's for your birthday.
  Thank you. It's very kind of you.
  You can't have it yet. It's for your birthday.
  Anything from Grandpa?
Not today. Sorry.
  Is there anything there for me?
  As if!
Look what Cam sent me!
Don't even THINK of asking to borrow it.
  I wouldn't be seen dead in it.
  Did I forget to mention it's from Cam,
  who is in New York...
  Tracy!
  ..thinking of Tracy Beaker always?
New York, New York...
Boy germs! Yuk!
  We must do something about Crash.
  I must do something about this.
Nathan!
  There's hardly a dish left in one piece.
  What?
  Crash!
Oh...
  This pile isn't getting smaller.
  I think it's breeding.
  From Cam.
The wrinkles are from the post.
Nathan will iron it for you.
Aw, thanks!
  Is Elaine working with Crash and anger management techniques?
  Yes.
Well, they're not very effective.
I mean...I could have a word with him, if you'd like.
  He's a reasonable dude when he's not blowing his top.
  Or you could...
I don't suppose that either one of you wants to tell Tracy...
Idiot!
  I'll buy you a new top. I'll buy you two!
  You can't buy one like that!
  It was special.
  I'm trying to watch something.
  It says "cool iron"!
  Shut up about your stupid, boring T shirt.
  You just butt out!
  "I've got a 2 T shirt from NY. I'm special"(!)
  What would you know?
Nobody ever sent YOU anything in the mail. Not even a postcard.
That's how special you are.
  How's Crash?
  Well...
  He seems to have calmed down a bit.
  Crash?
  could have been hurt.
  There are more important things.
What about this? You should replace the incompetent members of staff.
What happened to those visualisation techniques we worked on?
To help you with your anger?
Remember?
Every time we feel anger, we make beautiful pictures in our head
and we calm down.
Shall we give it a try?
Hm?
Deep breath.
And we're walking through a grassy meadow full of lovely flowers
towards the beautiful mountain...
  It's a waste of time.
  Perhaps we're not trying hard enough.
  I do try.
  Things got really out of hand today.
Someone might have got hurt.
We wondered if you might be happier somewhere else.
< No!
How could you be so dumb?
  Nathan, haven't you got the washing to do?
  This is more important.
Think of a beautiful scene. The blue...sky...and...
I don't want to hurt people.
I know.
I get angry. Just like him.
You're not like your dad.
I wanted to hurt Tracy.
But you didn't.
You only damage things, not people.
You're not like him.
He's got to go.
  That's a bit harsh.
  He's defiant, irresponsible...
  He's just a kid.
That's the problem   he's one of the kids.
He can't help being a kid.
He's supposed to be a care worker.
  I thought you were talking about Crash!
  Keep up, Duke.
"Keep up, Duke"(!)
I've already said I'm sorry.
It was just a stupid T shirt.
That goes with the coloureds.
  Will you help me with something?
  I've really got to do this.
It's really, really important.
Oh, Marco!
Get off!
Sit! Sit!
Stay!
Tell the others to meet me in the basement, but don't tell the adults.
Fetch!
  What are you doing? Get off, Marco!
  Nath, what did you want?
  It's time for a big clean out of your rooms.
The squirrel's in the garden eating all your vegetables!
Get out of it, squirrels! Waaargh! Waaargh!
Chipped.
Not chipped.
Cracked.
Stick them all in there...
That's great. Well done.
Get out.
Throw it at me.
I won't duck.
Look, I'm a show off and a pain
and I'm really, really sorry I made you mad.
OK, I'm the biggest pain in the world.
Worse than Shelley with the nit comb. Worse than Elaine the Pain.
  Nobody's worse than Elaine the Pain.
  Agreed.
Now, come with me.
  It's for you.
  Is this a joke or something?
  Crash!
It's a Crash cupboard.
It's good, isn't it?
  Wow!
  Wait...
Come on, everyone. Behind the door. Come on.
Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash!
You've been making playhouses when I told you to do the chores!
  It's not a playhouse.
  Not now, Crash. Nathan, I'm sick...
  Try it.
Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley!
Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley!
Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley! Go, Shelley!
It's, um, an anger management room.
  This is what you've done instead of the washing?
  It wasn't his fault.
  It was my idea.
  Was it now?
  I'll...do it now.
  No, no. It's too late.
You keep up the good work   I'LL do the washing.
After I've phoned Cam in New York and asked her to get a new T shirt,
  the cost of which...
  Comes out my wages.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash!
Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash! Go, Crash!
