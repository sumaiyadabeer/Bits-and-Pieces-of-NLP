Britain's animals are under threat.
All too often, our wildlife and domestic pets
are the victims of cruelty, persecution and neglect.
Fighting to save them is a dedicated band of people
trying to protect and care for them right around the clock.
This is Animal 24:7.
Today on Animal 24:7...
Let's have a look at them, then.
The owner whose love of pets is out of control.
You have too many animals here. You've got at least one of everything!
Under lock and key  
the evidence of an international crime.
This is what it's all about. Lots and lots and lots of eggs.
And Jasmine the pregnant puss
gets her first scan.
There's definitely some babies in there.
That row of dots is a kitten's backbone.
See that little heart beating?
But for some people, the compulsion to collect animals
can have dire consequences.
These so called animal hoarders are rarely cruel,
just unable to cope with the demands of keeping so many pets.
RSPCA inspector Selina Chan is on her way to the latest case.
This small terraced house in South Wales is home to a pet owner
who simply loves animals.
Now there's a fresh complaint.
When I get calls to this house, I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle.
She has this hoarding tendency about her
and I know there's always going to be more here when I get the call.
The report suggests there might be dogs living in poor conditions.
But Selina suspects this could just be the start of the story.
Hello. Selina of the RSPCA.
I've had another call about the dogs.
  Is it all right to have a look?
  Yes.
Selina's first job is to check outside.
Let's have a look at them, then.
The owner takes her to the back yard where the dogs are living.
Come on, you.
Come on!
  How many dogs have you got altogether?
  Only those.
I had a call saying there's five dogs here.
  Five?
  You haven't got five? Right, OK, that's good.
Selina is told there are just two dogs living here.
Come on, sweetie.
Snowy and an energetic terrier called Shiloh.
Hello, you.
Finding two rather than five is a welcome development,
but the good news is short lived.
There's a lot of cleaning here to be done.
  The place is covered in faeces.
  I know.
You could do with having a clean up in here as well.
There's a lot of faeces on the floor. Maybe take that carpet and replace it, OK?
Pop the dogs back, then.
And then we'll have a look at the rest of the animals you've got
so I can make a note of what you've got.
The first stage of Selina's visit has not gone well.
Next, Selina moves to the front garden, home to two rabbits and one ferret.
It's filthy inside.
Right?
Like the back yard, the conditions are not good.
You can see rotting food. I see you've filled the water up.
Are you coping, keeping this ferret?
I want to find a home for him.
Right, OK.
We can look to do that today for you.
With one pet signed over,
Selina moves on to the rabbits.
Again, it's absolutely filthy.
Can we pop this door open so I can see the bedding area?
  That is disgusting.
Evidence is mounting that this owner is struggling to cope.
I'm not really happy for these rabbits to stay here
because of the condition in the hutch.
Do you want me to help you re home them?
I'll take those today because I don't want them staying in here.
Three pets have been signed over. Now it's time to see what's inside.
So what have we got in the house?
Selina isn't prepared for what's waiting in the living room.
This is a Chinese water dragon.
Like all reptiles, they need specialist care.
  Have you ever had a reptile before?
  No.
  Okey dokes.
The way this one's being kept is simply not good enough.
I'm really not happy with this staying here.
You've got completely the wrong set up for that type of animal.
He looks in good condition. I'm not concerned about how he looks at all.
But your environment is not correct.
Would you be happy for me to take this?
If you want to be looking at keeping reptiles and things...
Right. Things have to drastically improve with this, OK?
The owner is reluctant to sign the water dragon over.
So Selina gives her a chance to show she can improve things.
You need a filtered water pool.
You'll never get a filtered water pool in there because it's too small, OK?
Plus, the thing is, your house is boiling hot.
And you've got a basking light and a heat mat in there.
I bet it's baking in there.
You need to get a new viv by next week.
With all animals accounted for downstairs,
Selina now heads upstairs.
Okey dokes.
The first room she comes to is the bathroom.
So we've got a grey female and five kittens.
  How old are the kittens?
  About four weeks.
About four weeks.
The new family is healthy,
but they shouldn't be living in a basket in a bathroom.
I see you're putting food and water down for them.
But you're failing on keeping the place clean.
You need to be on top of this, OK?
I recommend getting a bigger litter tray for mum.
The owner promises the kittens will be going to new homes
once they're big enough
and she wants mum to go, too.
We need to focus on getting her neutered as soon as these kittens come off.
When they're old enough to go, I want to do re homing anyway.
Right. OK. Why do you want to re home her once those kittens are gone?
Not coping?
We can help you with that once the kittens go.
There's no doubt that this owner loves animals.
But her desire to collect pets has gone beyond ornaments and photos.
Now she's slowly realising that her collecting has gone too far.
Can you smell it in here?
There are more animals across the landing.
You've got way too many cats.
You're talking five cats in this room.
Conditions in here are possibly the worst of all.
You're not on top of the cleaning.
I see you're putting food and water down and the cats are in good nick.
I'm not concerned that you're not caring for them in that way,
but you are so not on top of the cleaning.
It stinks in here. I'm surprised you bother coming in here, it's that smelly.
The owner is told this room must be cleaned
and Selina persuades her to sign one of the cats over.
I'd like to get the number of cats you have right down, to be honest.
You have way too many for this house.
You cannot be keeping five cats in this room.
After double checking there are no more animals anywhere...
  Any in this room?
  No.
  Nothing in there or there. OK.
..the conversation moves downstairs.
  If you wanted to re home her, then...
  I want to re home this one.
A total of four animals have been signed over today.
But just as Selina is about to leave...
Have you got a bird?
..she hears a suspicious noise coming from a bedroom,
the room she was told was empty.
You said there's wasn't anything in here.
It seems this collection could yet grow further.
You've just got too much.
Coming up:
I would suggest you get rid of the small animals at least. All right?
The birds have to go by the weekend as well.
And the casualties of an illegal trade.
  Each one of these eggs represents a bird that isn't.
  Exactly right.
Somebody's literally taken a living egg, drilled a hole in it,
and flushed the bird down the sink.
It's estimated that it can cost up to Â£10,000 a year to keep a pet.
Undoubtedly, the biggest expense is vet fees.
Fortunately for owners on low incomes
there are charity funded animal hospitals up and down the country.
They make sure that pets can get the care they need.
Victoria, London.
This is the oldest animal hospital in the UK.
It's run by The Blue Cross.
From routine treatment to life saving surgery,
a skilled team of vets and nurses work round the clock.
On average, 100 pets are brought in every day by worried owners.
One of today's patients is Otis,
a nine year old cat who's not been eating.
Yep, he's off his food.
He's losing weight fast, so vet Nigel Smith begins an examination.
This puss has been generally off colour.
He's just not right.
Probably sleeping a bit more than usual.
One thing that has been a consistent feature is that he's abnormally yellow.
That's jaundice.
OK, guy. Let's see.
His lips are a bit yellow as well.
Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin,
usually associated with liver disorder.
Nigel fears Otis may have cancer.
He's immediately anaesthetised so urgent tests can be carried out.
He's immensely poorly. His liver function is very, very poor.
He's facing a pretty unclear future at the moment.
First the team takes x rays.
The results will show if Otis has any hope of making a recovery.
We want to make sure that his chest is OK,
make sure there's no evidence of cancer in the lung tissue.
Because that may well alter what we do.
We might have to think again as to what our treatment options are,
what's realistic and what's fair to put him through.
If Otis has cancer of the liver,
there's a real danger it's spread to the chest.
Nigel checks the results.
Good news. No obvious signs of cancer in the chest.
That's good. So whatever is going on in the abdomen, or in the liver,
then we can assume that it's restricted to the liver.
So far, so good.
The x rays might be positive,
but the team's still no closer to finding out what is wrong with Otis.
It's time for him to go under the knife.
Right. We have a very swollen liver.
The team can now have a close look at all of his vital organs.
And the seriousness of his condition becomes clear.
  This is its stomach.
  Look at that stomach! It's so yellow.
Surgeon Charlotte Hamilton is alarmed by these jaundice levels
and she knows diagnosis isn't straightforward.
There's no obvious large cancer lesion that we were concerned about.
But the other thing we're worried about is there might be a blockage
so we're trying to flush the liver through, through the gall bladder
to see if we can find any blockage there.
This is a delicate operation.
The team is in for a long afternoon.
It's complicated because it's an elderly cat.
There are multiple things that could be going on.
Sometimes, things aren't always as they seem
so when you have a look at her insides,
it's not obvious what's going on. It'll be touch and go over the next 24 hours, basically.
The Blue Cross has four animal hospitals around the UK.
In Grimsby, Jenna Robinson has brought in Jasmine,
a cat she inherited from her aunt, who died recently.
I didn't know much about cats. Didn't even have a cat.
Then I got told I needed to keep her. I've brought her in for a check up.
And it seems this not so welcome inheritance is even more than Jenna bargained for.
She suspects Jasmine is pregnant.
Hello. Jasmine Robinson?
Accompanied by her son, Jenna takes Jasmine to see vet Wendy Adams.
Right. This is Jasmine. How long have you had Jasmine?
  About four weeks.
  Four weeks. Right.
In those four weeks, Jasmine's rapidly changing body shape has aroused Jenna's suspicions.
Ooh, yes.
That's quite a large tummy you've got there, isn't it?
Good girl. You're very pretty, aren't you?
There's definitely some babies in there.
I can't tell how many this way,
so in a minute we'll scan her and see if we can see some kittens.
It's a big moment for all mums to be,
that first ultrasound scan.
But it won't work through fur.
So we'll just do a little shave on her tummy.
I'm just going to pop the light out.
Put that on her tummy and see what we can see.
All eyes are turned to the monitor, to see their first sign of life.
  You can see a spine.
  You can see a little spine. See that?
That row of dots is a kitten's backbone.
See the little heart beating?
Just fluttering, isn't it?
Wendy can see one healthy kitten.
There's another little spine at the top there.
Be a good girl.
I'll just pop the lights back on so we can see what we're doing.
And it seems this kitten is going to be arriving much sooner than Jenna thought.
I would think she's got less than two weeks to go.
Just a few weeks ago,
Jenna had no desire to own any cats.
Inheriting Jasmine was one thing.
Now she has just a couple of weeks to prepare for another new arrival.
Later...
It's a lovely smile, isn't it?
..we find out what's troubling Mucker.
He's a lumpy old boy.
But that's not a fatty lump.
So unfortunately I think it's a bit more serious.
And the nervous terrier taken from a hoarder's home.
Shallow's a bit hesitant because I don't think he's ever been on a lead.
He's not sure what he's meant to be doing!
I'm sure if I took the lead off him, he'd walk around fine.
This street in Low Willington near Crook in County Durham,
looks like many others across our county towns.
But when the police raided a house here in February 2009,
they found one of the most unusual and varied egg collections
they'd ever seized in Britain.
This is Andrew Seed,
the man who held a hoard of eggs from some of the world's rarest birds.
At Durham crown court,
he pleaded guilty to 17 offences
relating to smuggling, trading, and keeping of birds' eggs.
The charges related to this collection,
filmed at his house during a police raid.
There were thousands of eggs stored in cabinets and drawers,
and evidence of illegal trading.
RSPB investigator Guy Shorrock is one of the officers
who brought Seed to book.
It was February last year when I first came down here.
I wasn't sure what to expect, really.
'He's now brought me to the local police station
'where the evidence is still under lock and key.'
This is where they're still stored, is it?
This is how it was when I found it.
There's a lot of furniture in here.
I have a feeling I know what'll be in these drawers if I open it.
Absolutely.
Wow.
This is what it's all about, as far as Mr Seed is concerned.
Lots and lots and lots of eggs.
  And all these as well?
  There's over 2,000 here in total.
It was amazing. He was part of an international egg smuggling ring
with people in the States and Australia and all over.
There were eggs in little boxes being moved across the planet.
Trading and collecting birds' eggs
has been illegal since the introduction of the Wildlife and Countryside Act in 1981.
Before then, the robbing of eggs from nests had led to some species vanishing altogether.
These are the eggs of a species called Red backed Shrike.
This species is now extinct as a breeding species in this country.
During the 1960s and '70s and early '80s
it was harried mercilessly by egg collectors.
  Wow.
  It's just one of the eggs they hold in high regard.
  It's well marked with a pink flush on it.
  Amazing.
Can we have a look in more detail at what's in there?
'The scale of Seed's collection is staggering. Trays and trays containing thousands of eggs...'
This is an extraordinary collection!
'..taken from nests all over the world.'
2,500 eggs.
That's a lot in anyone's book, but a large number of species, too?
Yes, it's particularly unusual, this collection.
Most collections I deal with are British or European eggs.
But it became apparent there's a smattering of eggs from every continent.
Let's look at the ones in here.
Even I can read this one. It says "vulture".
These are Egyptian vultures. It's a heavily declining species in Europe.
Closer to home, the Golden Eagle,
perhaps the most majestic bird still alive in the British Isles.
  These are Golden Eagle eggs?
  Very popular with egg collectors.
And the terribly sad thing is,
we know Golden Eagles how grand they are, what fantastic birds.
Each one of these eggs represents a bird that isn't.
Exactly right.
Somebody's taken a living egg, drilled a hole in it,
and flushed the life of that bird down the sink.
Included in the evidence seized were tools designed to destroy the life inside an egg.
  So those drill down into the egg itself?
  That's right, yes.
'The paraphernalia of egg blowing.'
Once you've got the hole in the egg,
what they will do is use pipettes, these things here. And often syringes
to force air into the shell
and flush out the yolk back through the same hole.
Then they swill it out with water to clean it out.
This collection didn't come cheap.
Some of the clutches are reported to have cost up to Â£6,000.
The rarest and most endangered species like these
of the roseate tern fetching the highest prices.
Sadly, you deal with a lot of egg collectors, egg thieves, in your work.
How does this case compare with the run of cases?
What's interesting is the diversity of eggs in here. It's amazing.
Eggs from the States, from America, eggs from captive birds, from wild birds.
It was clear that he was completely obsessed with trying to build up
the most diverse collection possible.
He wanted as many different species from all over the world.
It's really an obsessional behaviour. It's trophy hunting.
For the egg thief, it's about the thrill of the chase,
going to the countryside,
finding the eggs of rare birds or finding eggs that are difficult to find.
Getting them home without being caught.
Mr Seed was different. All he was interested in was building this diverse collection.
No regard about where the eggs had come from,
who'd taken them, how rare they were.
All he wanted was this big collection.
The RSPB was alerted to the collection after a tip off
about as series of suspicious emails.
In May 2010,
Andrew Seed received a nine month jail sentence,
suspended for two years.
He was also ordered to pay over Â£3,500 in costs.
The RSPB is still considering what to do with the eggs.
Coming up...
A new baby for Jasmine.
Just started to open her eyes, just trying to walk.
Still a bit wobbly. But she's lovely.
A big ball of fluff.
There is no limit to the number of pets someone can have.
What matters is how they're looked after.
In South Wales, RSPCA inspector Selina Chan is with someone
whose love of animals is out of control.
So far, she's found two dogs, ten cats, two rabbits, a ferret and a water dragon
and now it looks as though there could be even more.
Selina thought she'd found all the animals in this house but she was wrong.
Did I hear a bird? Where's the bird?
She's just heard the sound of birds coming from inside this bedroom.
You told me there wasn't anything in here.
And sure enough, her suspicions are right.
And hamsters. Right. OK.
This small, dark bedroom is home to two cockatiels, two mice
and a hamster.
You've just got too much.
The number of animals kept in this small house has grown from 16 to 21.
Can you open that curtain cos it's awful dark and birds love the light.
The homeowner says the birds belong to a friend
and they'll be gone by the weekend.
Clean it out by the weekend when I come back.
They've got plenty of perches. They're both ringed.
What else have we got?
Selina turns her attention to the mice and hamster.
How often are you cleaning the cages out?
That doesn't look like once or twice a week.
You need to keep on top of that, all right?
You need to open the window so you've got some ventilation.
It's not fair that they're being stuck in here.
I don't need to tell you you need to clean the cage out.
Yet again, it's clear this owner is struggling to keep up with the demands of so many pets.
You have too many animals here. You've got at least one of everything.
If you're not spending time with these, what's the point in them being here?
Plus it's costing you more money. I suggest you get rid of the small animals at least.
Clean the birds out. They have to go by the weekend.
Although the animals are healthy, they just can't live like this.
Selina is determined to work with the owner to reduce her numbers.
But it's going to take time.
Brilliant. That's your copy.
Can you help me get the rabbits and the ferret out?
I'll bring a cage in for the cat as well.
This owner has not purposefully neglected her pets.
But her love of animals is out of control.
I'll run these over to the van, then we'll sort the rabbits out.
Today, she agrees to give up four of her 21 animals.
Put that one in.
Two rabbits, a cat and a ferret.
That would be great if I can have that. Brilliant.
The number of pets living here is now down to 17.
Selina's hoping this will just be the start of things.
I think she will do what I've asked.
When I went back in the second time, she'd cleaned the litter trays out.
She's taking the advice on board.
I think it'll be a long process.
It won't be a quick fix.
I'll keep an eye on her in the next couple of weeks and hopefully she'll do all I asked.
This is the RSPCA centre in Merthyr Tydfil.
Here the animals can now enjoy clean and comfortable beds.
I don't suspect there'll be anything wrong with them.
We'll board them here overnight and get a health check in the morning.
We'll put them up for re homing if they get a full bill of health.
Animal hoarding is a common problem for the RSPCA.
Hey, you.
It's something Selina comes into contact with on an all too regular basis.
What makes a hoarder a hoarder?
Just not knowing when to stop.
Thinking they're doing the right thing by helping the animals.
Unfortunately, because the numbers increase,
they find themselves in a bit of trouble where they can't actually keep up
with the number of animals they've got.
Most hoarders don't see a problem with the animals they've got,
don't see a problem with the conditions they're kept in,
so at least the owner of these animals realises she has too many
and is being co operative and handing them over for re homing.
It has been a successful day for Selina.
But she has no idea how many more animals the owner will eventually let go.
Still to come:
The lady explained to me she didn't want the larger terrier.
This is quite common, especially with people who do hoard animals.
The novelty wears off quite quickly.
Now we return to the dedicated team at the Blue Cross Hospitals.
Earlier, we saw staff operate on a cat with jaundice
and perform ultrasound on a pregnant tabby.
In a moment, we'll catch up on both of those.
But first, another patient has just walked through the door.
The Blue Cross provides an ambulance service
for pets whose owners are unable to bring them in for treatment.
Mucker the bulldog is the latest to arrive at the London Victoria Hospital.
  How's Mucker?
  He's with the ambulance driver, John Webb.
His left, hind leg. I'll attempt to get him on the table!
I can see why... Are you all right?
Poor old Mucker!
Hey, mate, how are you?
It's a lovely smile, isn't it?
Mucker's appointment is with vet Kathy Taylor.
The main concern the owner has is that Mucker's left hind leg, there's a lump on the joint.
  Yes.
  He's walking badly.
His owners are worried that the lump on his leg is cancerous.
Mucker's quite an elderly English bulldog.
As he's aged, he's been becoming a bit more arthritic
because he has these very prominent elbows and the real bulldog English stance.
Churchill would be proud of him!
But this lump on the leg   here, Mucker, turn around, mate.
  Good boy. He's a lumpy old boy, but that's not a fatty lump.
  No.
Unfortunately I think it's probably a bit more serious.
But I'm hoping very much that it's not cancer.
Because of his age, if Mucker does have cancer treatment,
it will be especially difficult.
It is, obviously, a very serious thing.
In a younger dog,
we would consider amputation of the leg in some cases.
Chemotherapy is used quite routinely now in pets,
as it is in humans.
So it really would depend on what type of cancer it was.
Mucker hobbles through to x ray.
Soon, the results are in.
We've taken a quick shot of his hock,
which is his ankle joint.
What we can see is this enlarged area we were looking at in the consultation.
The great news is that it's not cancer.
The lump is actually a fluid filled sac called a bursa.
Kathy wants to treat it with medicine, not surgery.
Mucker is not the sort of breed that you would want to anaesthetise
without a very, very good reason.
So we're not going to muck around with Mucker!
We're assuming that this is a soft tissue swelling.
I'm going to put him on some anti inflammatories and some antibiotics.
Hopefully, some of the swelling will come down,
but we won't completely cure it.
We'll have to watch it and in future give him more tablets for it.
Before Mucker goes home, Kathy briefs John with information for his owners.
She will ask why this has happened.
I think partially the reason
is friction where the skin overlaps the top of the hock.
There's some swelling there and some fluid has formed
over the outside of the joint.
But that's all because he's quite an old dog,
and getting up and down is probably quite difficult for him.
The friction caused by that has led to this sac filling with fluid.
  Yes.
  Sure. But good news, it's not cancer.
  Yes.
  Adios, senorita!
  See you later.
  See you later.
Come on, Mucker.
So this old Mucker heads back to the ambulance ready for home,
where he'll soon be reunited with some very relieved owners.
Earlier, we saw Otis, a desperately ill cat.
Otis was badly jaundiced, unable to eat and losing weight fast.
He's immensely poorly. His liver function is very, very poor.
He underwent long and complicated surgery.
Right. So we have a very swollen liver.
Finally, the team discovered he had a blocked bile duct.
This affected the function of his liver.
Surgeons were able to remove the blockage, but Otis still faced a long recovery.
For the owner, Claudia, it's been a very distressing few weeks.
I had lots of friends all willing him on, saying, "Come on, you can make this."
I did go in occasionally and visit him, but you feel so cut off,
him being in hospital and you being here.
I tried to not think about it, but there are occasions when you think, "What if he doesn't make it?"
It's very upsetting. I cried my eyes out, just thinking that it might not be a happy outcome.
But for Otis and Claudia, it is a happy outcome.
Otie!
Come on, you!
After making a full recovery, he's back home.
Hello! You're such a good boy, aren't you?
His off colour days are now well and truly behind him.
When we got him home, it was lovely.
He stretched and walked around
and just lay on the floor.
Stretched out all his muscles.
He's really enjoyed it and we've enjoyed having him back.
Just a few weeks ago, Otis was unable to eat.
Vets feared for his future.
Bit louder, can't hear you(!)
But now he has a renewed appetite for life,
not to mention his food.
You'd think they hadn't been fed for days!
And in Grimsby, there's another happy ending.
Earlier, Jenna Robinson had brought her inherited cat, Jasmine, into the hospital.
I didn't know much about cats.
And got more than she bargained for.
Definitely some babies in there.
Jasmine was pregnant.
Less than two weeks to go now.
Jenna hadn't wanted one cat, let alone a whole family,
and wasn't sure what she should do.
Three weeks later, this is Jasmine...
..and her kitten, Juno.
She's just started to open her eyes, just trying to walk.
Still a bit wobbly.
But she's lovely.
A big ball of fluff!
Mum and baby are doing really well.
And both Jasmine and Juno are staying with Jenna.
We're going to keep them both.
Cos Jasmine's just my little girl now.
And now I've got another one to look after.
When Jenna inherited Jasmine from her aunt,
she was very much a reluctant cat owner.
Not any more.
I've had her seven weeks and I've gone from hating cats
to loving cats,
to wanting to keep another one.
It's just crackers!
In Wales, RSPCA inspector Selina Chan has been visiting a small end terrace.
The house was home to over 20 animals,
all kept in dirty conditions.
There was also a Chinese water dragon in a completely unsuitable vivarium.
Selina's already taken away four of the animals,
and left strict instructions for the others to be cleaned out.
Selina's back at the hoarder's house to see if her advice has been followed.
Hi.
On this visit, our cameras aren't invited inside.
It's soon clear the improvements have been made.
I can see you've cleared the rubbish away
and the litter trays are in and the floors are clean. There's food and water.
And Selina is delighted with the water dragon's vivarium.
I'm massively pleased with what you've done for the dragon. It's a really good job.
Um, you know,
well, it's practically a brilliant set up.
With the help of her family, things have taken a turn for the better.
Hello, you. Looking a bit better as well.
There is still work to be done here.
But Selina's encouraged by the progress made.
I can already see that it's a lot cleaner.
Still a fair bit to clean, though, if you can take the bags away
and put the patio slabs down properly.
That would be great then. Brilliant. I'm really pleased with outside.
And the owner's good intentions don't stop there.
Bring her up to the van for me.
Today she agrees to sign over a hamster and the young Jack Russell, Shiloh.
Pop him in there for me.
The young lady explained to me she doesn't want the larger terrier.
This is quite common, especially with people who do hoard animals.
The novelty wears off quite quickly
and then they just want to get rid of it.
Shiloh and the hamster are taken straight to the RSPCA clinic.
Once they've been checked over, they'll be ready for re homing.
Come on.
But when Selina arrives, there's another problem.
Shiloh's a bit hesitant because I don't think he's ever been on a lead.
He's not sure what he's meant to be doing.
I'm sure if I took the lead off him, he'd walk around fine.
But I'm gaining his trust now.
Come on, then. Come on!
Come on, then.
Hey.
Hello.
Selina eventually wins Shiloh round.
Good boy!
Come here.
But this reaction has shown he'll need a very special owner.
Shiloh needs lots of TLC and a lot of attention.
Someone who has time to do some training with him,
get him out on the lead and show him that's normal.
But I'm sure we can find someone who's willing to take him on.
And a few weeks later,
Shiloh has met that perfect match!
What's this?
Come here.
Shiloh, come on.
Come on.
He's now living with Ben Fennell, who's been giving him lessons in how to behave.
There you go.
All his nervousness has gone
and he's no longer frightened of the lead.
We had a list of what we were looking for in a dog
and this little monster near enough ticked every single box.
It was absolutely perfect for us.
Good boy.
Last year, Ben's old dog died,
but Ben's loss is Shiloh's gain.
I get an awful lot out of having Shiloh in the house.
With the house empty,
it was a case of didn't want to come home
cos of walking through the door and not having anyone there to say hello to.
He's always happy to see me when I come home.
If I go out of the room just for five minutes, he's hyper to see me again.
Aren't you, mister?
Among the skills Ben's trying to teach him
is how to be safe on the roads.
Wait.
Good boy.
Straight over. Come on.
Good boy!
Good boy.
And along with lessons on safety...
Straight over. Good boy!
..he's also picking up a few tricks!
Good boy!
Good boy!
All the animals Selina took away have been found new owners.
And, like Shiloh, they're now enjoying a life
where they can finally be at the centre of attention.
Good boy!
