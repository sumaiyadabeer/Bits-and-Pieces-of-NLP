himself, his whereabouts are unknown. Last night, he used a
radio address to call on his supporters to cleanse the city,
promising martyrdom or victory. This report from Wyre Davies.
This war may almost be over, and the rebel fighters may sense
few people had ventured out of their homes. They know this is
still a dangerous place. We went back to Colonel Gaddafi's compound
opposition fighters last night. It became apparent there are still
Gaddafi loyalists inside who will fight to the death. We're now well
inside Colonel Gaddafi's compound. The outer ring has been pierced and
taken by rebel fighters. This morning, the inner compound is
controlled by militia loyal to Colonel Gaddafi. There is fighting
going on there. There is a huge gunfight. These rebel fighters are
going in to try and mop up what is left of the resistance. The man who
has ruled this country for more than 40 years gave a defiant radio
address. I call on all the
Tripoli residents, with all the young, old and armed brigades to
defend the city, to cleanse it, put an end to the traitors and kick
them out of our city. If you allow them to remain in your city, they
will end up killing you, torturing you and making your lives miserable.
No one really believes that. This is now a city and a country largely
in rebel hands. With scenes reminiscent of Saddam Hussein's
demise in Iraq, many are worried for the future of this divided,
broken country. Some of today's fiercest fighting centred near the
Rixos Hotel in central Tripoli, where many foreign diplomats and
journalists are based. They are safe, but concerned. In Tripoli's
Green Square thousands of joyful Libyans celebrated their freedom,
knowing victory over a much hated regime is almost complete. Colonel
Gaddafi has yet to fall. Until he does, most Libyans will not openly
celebrate or rejoice. He mentioned the Rixos Hotel. Our
correspondent Matthew Price is one of them there. He said they were
running out of food and water and parts of the hotel had no
electricity. It is a desperate situation for about 35 foreign
nationals here. Brits, Americans, there is a US Congressman here,
there is an Indian parliamentarian here. The situation deteriorated
massively overnight when it became clear that we were unable to leave
the hotel of our own free will, and we were roaming around the corridor.
We believe there are still snipers on the roof of the hotel and
effectively our movements are curtailed. The ITN cameraman just
had an AK 47 pointed at him. He is oK. That ended amicablely. There is
a huge amount of apprehensive here. Let's go to the compound, to
Gaddafi's former compound. Wyre Davies is there for us. Heavy
fighting, we are hearing there? lot of intense fighting. This group
of Gaddafi fighters, loyalists have been stuck inside that massive
compound. They are prepared to fight to the death. They have been
lobbing out artillery shells. Bullets are whizzing overhead at
times. Even though Gaddafi has lost control of this country, those
loyal to him are prepared to fight to the end. It has quietened down a
lot. There has been heavy fighting in and around this two and a half
mile square compound, under which there are tunnels and passages in
which people can hide and shoot from. The situation here, in this
part of Tripoli at least, is still very precarious. So much
speculation about the whereabouts of Colonel Gaddafi. Some suggesting
he may not be far from where you are? I don't think he has fled too
far. It is difficult for something to go that far in this country. He
cannot fly anywhere. Any evacuation would have had to be made overland.
There is talk fighting to the south of the centre. That may be with
people protecting Colonel Gaddafi. Until he is caught or he is killed,
a lot of people in this country won't want to go out on the streets
to celebrate fully because they are weary of what might happen if the
Colonel and his supporters are on the streets. The Government in
waiting, the national transitional council says it wants a democratic
Government and a just constitution. The head of the council, Mahmoud
Jabril, is due to hold talks in Italy and France today. Our
correspondent assesses the tasks ahead.
In Benghazi, another night of celebration. This time, with
greater confidence that the downfall of Colonel Gaddafi is
almost complete. In this city, rebel headquarters,
until now, opposition leaders are eager to get to trip ly. They are
aware of the acute need to launch new Government and establish order.
With Colonel Gaddafi at large in some cities, including Sabha in the
south, still apparently under his control, huge tasks lie ahead.
We expect a domino effect to start in the next phase.
Usually the fall of the capital means the fall of the regime. Now
the symbols of the regime are hidden somewhere. The uprisings in
Tripoli will affect the southern cities. I hope I'm not exaggerating
that I expect within the next two days many more uprisings will take
place. The mead yalt challenges facing leaders amount to creating a
new Libya. They have to establish a new Government in Tripoli, to fill
a vacuum, where revenge attacks could run out of control. That
means re building the security forces, including the police, based
this time on public trust rather than fear. The new administration
needs to restore power, hospitals and schools.
The state was Gaddafi. He systematically eradicated all
institutions. Anything that could pose any threat to him. There is
not a professionalised military. There are not political parties.
The bureaucracy, from one day to the next they did not know what
they were doing. He created a web of confusion. So, you are starting
from scratch. Then there are the affects of the uprising. This
hospital is overflowing with the wounded. Other hospitals,
particularly in Tripoli, cannot even function.
Do we have an idea....? In London and other capitals, plans
for international assistance are starting to be activated.
regime has clearly lost control of much of the capital and much of the
country. It is time now for Colonel Gaddafi to stop issuing a
delusional statements and to recognise that has happened, that
control of the country is not going to return. He should be telling his
dwindling forces now to stand down. In Benghazi, the opposition
stronghold, a mood of celebration is tinged with a sense of the
overwhelming challenge ahead. Rebels are united now, getting rid
of Gaddafi. That unity needs to be maintained once he's finally gone.
James is here with me now. Security is obviously going to be an issue
for the in coming Government, what are their other prioritys? They
have so many. Of course they have to establish a Government of a
whole of Libya as quickly as possible. They need to fill the
vacuum in which anarchy could break out. The head of the transitional
council has said he wants to ensure Presidential elections within eight
months. They are setting out a timetable for an establishment of a
new Libya. He said they want Colonel Gaddafi and his family
taken alive and put on trial inside Libya, so that they say the new
Government can demonstrate it is quite different from the old regime
and he will receive the sort of treatment he never gave to Libyans
themselves. The irony is that Colonel Gaddafi, was in some ways a
unifying force. He has a new transitional Government made up
from my tribes from many regions, they need to pull together. This is
going to be the real test, I think. What they all could agree on was
they were determined to get rid of the dictator for the past 42 years,
Colonel Gaddafi and ess stab lish a new country. What we cannot    and
establish a new country. What we cannot be sure of is the divisions
among the transitional council and how they will step up to running a
country. Given what we have seen over the past 24 hours, in terms of
the international reaction, who will judge themselves to be winners
and losers out of this? It is interesting. We are seeing signs
from China, for instance, that they want to play operational catch up
now. They have not given the financial support that other NATO
countries, including Britain and France, have done. The Chinese are
worried they will lose contracts in the Energy Secretaryor. They are
talking about that. I think    energy sector. I think you can see
that they know that Gaddafi is history.
The National Security Council has met to discuss events in Libya. I
will join our correspondent. What are they saying about what is
happening in Libya this morning? What the British Government is
trying to do is project confidence. Confidence that the Gaddafi regime
is in its last days. Libyan people have rejected Colonel Gaddafi and
he is in the words of William Hague, as we heard, "delusional." In
practical terms they are working NATO on the on going military work.
They are working humanitarian agencies, particularly talking
about the fate of the main hospital in Tripoli. At the UN trying to
unfreeze frozen assets. ï¿½12 billion of those in this country alone. It
has to be said, no one in that council meeting this morning, no 
one here at the Foreign Office knows where Colonel Gaddafi is. He
   until his regime falls a lot of detailed work on the future of
Libya is simply having to remain on hold. Thank you very much. Let's
get the latest now from Benghazi, where the national transitional
council have been based and are hoping to move to Tripoli when?
Well, a good question. We don't know. They were talking about today.
I get a sense they are hesitating in the light of that uncertain
situation in Tripoli. Although the head of the Transitional National
Council seems to be back here now, Mr Jabril. They are readying
themselves, but don't want to go into an uncertain situation. That
is preparing. They are also, they say, negotiating for the surrender
of Sirte. The biggest town in control of Colonel Gaddafi's forces.
That is halfway between here and Tripoli. The rebel fighters have
not got very close to it. They are not putting a great deal of
military pressure on it. It is stacked full of Gaddafi loyalists
and equipment. Nevertheless, here they say they are confident that
they will negotiate the surrender of Sirte soon. The takeover, the
rebel moves, very swift and unexpected move into Tripoli at the
weekend, was apparently a well  planned operation, we are being
told from here, called Operation Mermaid Dawn, under which rebel
fighters came out of Tripoli, trained here in Benghazi, with the
co operation of NATO and went back and waited, and as a sleeper cellin
side Tripoli before they rose up at the agreed moment, with the help of
defectors at an agreed signal at the weekend.
It may be surprising on that basis, that Colonel Gaddafi does seem to
have slipped away? Indeed so. I don't think anybody here knows any
more than they do in Tripoli, where he is presizely. Plenty of
speculation, thoughts that he may have gone to Sirte. He may have
gone to his stronghold in the south of the country, but frankly no one
And one Our main headline   fighting is still continuing in
Tripoli. Coming up, how good it is It seems that for many people,
going to the doctor can be bad for the blood pressure. It's thought
around a quarter of readings could be wrong, thanks to what's known as
"white coat syndrome"   in other words, actually seeing the doctor
can make the patient nervous and make blood pressure go up. So now a
new way of making the checks is being introduced, as our health
correspondent, Hywel Griffiths, now reports. Sheila could be one of 12
million people in the UK with hypertension, putting her at risk
of a stroke or heart attack. But the reading could also be down to
so called "white coat syndrome", when a patient's blood pressure is
raised because they are anxious. Previously we have made a series of
two or three readings in a clinical environment, either in a doctor's
surgery or in a hospital. And patients naturally get agitated and
stressed by coming to see us in that environment. To get a more
accurate picture of Sheila's blood pressure, she has been asked to
wear one of these, a portable monitor which will take a reading
every half an hour. Today's guidance suggests this should
become the standard way of monitoring blood pressure.
Introducing the monitors will cost the NHS around ï¿½5 million a year.
But by the end of the second year, that cost should be cancelled out
by having to treat fewer misdiagnosed patients. By the fifth
year, it is estimated that monitors could save the NHS more than ï¿½10
million a year. Research published in the Lancet suggests these
monitors are more cost effective way of diagnosing hypertension. It
is worn for 24 hours, and its stores are all of Sheila's readings.
It is not really discomfort, you know it is there, it is a bit
awkward if you go out to do the shopping. All of a sudden, this
noise starts and people look round. I just smile, to say, it is fine.
New guidance on testing may follow in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The new monitors could stop millions of patients from being

buildings along much of the east coast from Georgia all the way up
to the Canadian border. No one was hurt but it did cause widespread
This TV advert caught the moment the quake struck. This was near the
epicentre, in Virginia. It shook people off their feet and things
came off the shelves in supermarkets. There was damage and
debris but no reports of serious injuries. The earthquake did rattle
nerves up and down the east coast, though, forcing the automatic
shutdown of two reactors at a nuclear power plant in Virginia. In
Washington, rarely has the earth moved like this so close to the
seat of power. The White House was evacuated, as was the Pentagon, the
Capitol and other government buildings. President Obama is on
holiday, but those who felt the quelled    quake were taken by
surprise. It is kind of scary, you can feel it coming. You do not know
what it is until it is kind of over, then you realise what it was.
Everything started shaking and everybody looked around, wondering,
what is going on? A few of us knew it was an earthquake, and said, we
need to get out of the building. Several buildings were affected,
among them the cathedral in Washington, which suffered damage
to its central tower. In New York, thousands of office workers flooded
onto the streets after being evacuated. The first thing that
came to my mind was terrorists, bombs, or something. I was happy
when I heard it was just an earthquake. People were moving very
quickly, I would say mostly calm, but there was a slight sense of
panic. Seismologists say the quake was shallow, which is why it was
felt over such a vast area. The strongest earthquake in living
The latest round in the legal battle for the future of the
Olympic Stadium is under way at the High Court. Tottenham are
challenging the decision to hand it to West Ham United after the 2012
Games. Let's get the latest from our sports correspondent, Dan Roan,
at the High Court. Tottenham Hotspur are effectively challenging
the substance and process of the decision to award the stadium to
West Ham after the games. Their argument centres on a ï¿½40 million
loan which the borough of Newham have agreed to pay West Ham in
order for them to be able to move into the stadium in the 2014 15
season. West Ham plan to retain the running track and share the
facility with UK Athletics. Spurs say that because no private,
commercial bank would ever have loaned West Ham the money, it
constitutes state aid, which is illegal under EU law. On that basis,
the decision by the Olympic Park legacy company, which was then
backed by the Mayor of London and the Government, to award the
stadium to West Ham, and not Spurs, should be revisited. Talks were
going on as late as last night to try and avoid this court hearing?
That's right. And it is understood that Spurs came close to pulling
out of this attempt for a judicial review in the High Court. That's
what this case is all about. There were talks right up until the last
minute between Spurs and the Mayor and the Government trying to find
some kind of compromise which would have meant that Spurs would have
been paid a degree of money which would have enabled them to move
instead into a neighbouring site, near their traditional home of
White Hart Lane. Ever since the riots in Tottenham, there has been
increasing pressure on the club to stay in the borough of Haringey and
play a central role in the regeneration of the community. The
expectancy was that that could be one of the reasons for a compromise
to be reached. Instead, no compromise was reached, and Spurs
A new survey suggests 3G mobile phone technology across the UK
still isn't living up to the claims of the operators. Last month the
BBC invited people to download an app that would record coverage in
their area. It showed there are still too many 3G "not spots" and
too few hot spots. Our technology too few hot spots. Our technology
correspondent, Rory Cellan Jones, is with me.
A month ago we asked people to download a smartphone application
which would give a readout of their mobile phone signal as they
travelled around. More than 44,000 people did just that, and here's
the map we've generated from all their readings. And what it shows
is just how much coverage can vary   so type in your postcode and it
gives you a local readout. So for instance, here's Cardiff   now most
of it is green, which means you're getting a full 3G signal, but these
pink squares mean just 2G, not so good, and black is no connection,
right in the middle of a city. The Cardiff firm which helped with the

More than a million species of animal and plant life have so far
been found on Planet Earth. It may sound a lot, but according to
research out today that's just a fraction of the actual number that
could exist. And according to scientists, many species could
become extinct before they can be studied unless urgent action is
taken. Here's our environment Life is everywhere on our planet,
from the deep ocean to the atmosphere, from the poles to the
equator. We can see many species, but counting the total number of
them has been difficult. Until now, we have had a very broad
range of estimates, anywhere from 3 million to 100 million. So this
time we have refined the estimates and tightened the uncertainties, so
now we estimate there are around 8.7 million species on Earth.
they are right, this means that we know about just a fraction of the
world's life forms. Just over one million species have been formally
identified, which means that there are more than 7 million to go. Many
of them will live in currently unexplored places, such as the deep
ocean. At current rates of discovery, it would take about
1,000 years to find them all. That means many are likely to become
extinct before anyone has had a More now on the main story, the
fighting in Tripoli. We can speak to Lyse Doucet, in the capital, in
Green Square. Yes, we heard earlier in the programme about the fighting
around the compound. There's certainly lots of gunfire here in
Green Square, now called Martyr Square, but it is the sound of
celebration. There has been a constant parade all morning of
pick up trucks, bristling with guns, firing rifles and anti aircraft
guns into the air. We are wearing this protective body armour because
the shells can actually fall down again. But certainly, this is the
place where they come to celebrate. The scaffolding is still here from
September 1st, when Colonel Gaddafi was going to mark 42 years in power
for his green revolution. Now, they're going to be celebrating the

out my heart. He said, I would travel to Britain, I would describe

It's time now for the weather forecast yes, Hurricane Irene is
pounding the Bahamas. More on that coming up. You can see the bright
this afternoon, particularly in the west of the British Isles.
Elsewhere, there is some sunshine to be found. The cloud in the
south east of England will eventually break up. We still have
those showers in the far south west of England. The line of showers
making slow progress further top east. It is already into north west
England. In Northern Ireland, we have got plenty of sunshine at the
moment, but more showers will be coming in from the west. This line
of showers making progress across the central belt this afternoon. By
the evening, there could be Sion six around for north east England
and the Midlands.    there could be some showers around. Overnight,
there could be perhaps two inches of rain, which could produce local
eastern England. To the west, there will be some more showers coming in.
On Friday, more showers. Some uncertainty about the track of this
area of low pressure. But there will be plenty of showers around.
And that's how we start the weekend, very showery. But slowly through
the weekend, an improvement from the south and west. By Monday, it
should be largely dry. Hurricane Irene now. It is currently in the
Bahamas. It has just become a major hurricane. The track of the storm
still takes it to the east of the USA during the weekend. There's
