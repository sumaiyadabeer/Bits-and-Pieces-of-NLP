the last World Cup finals,    rematch. In 2007, the Aussies
retain the title in almost emphatic style. In Colombo Sri Lanka will
hope to run back some sort of a wrench for that painful defeat, the
us these are unbeaten in 31 Cricket World Cup games but Ricky Ponting's
men could have that record tested today. Sri Lanka claimed their
first match here after opening their campaign with a comprehensive
win over Canada. But in the capital they were somewhat surprisingly
Kenya here on Tuesday. Australia's players have almost had a week to
train and relax in spare last match and should be well prepared for
today after comfortably seen of Zimbabwe and their New Zealand in
their opening two games. Kumar Sangakkara won the toss and had no
hesitation in deciding to bat first, the home side make one change.
Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis will be a part of a three 
to the 7 frontline batsmen first to make use of what looks to be a very
dry pitch. The Aussie strategy is a complete contrast, they have made
no secret of the fact they think express pace gives them the best
chance of winning, let's go to the action and the first ball of the
second over, the score is 2 0, Tait is bowling to Dilshan and your
commentators are Russel Arnold and Alan Watkins. ColourWhite
(COMMENTATOR) Shaun Tait, 28 years of age, playing his 31st one day
international match, he has taken 56 wickets at just over 5 runs per
over. The speed merchants number one.    merchant. It is uppish,
there are two sets, that is an encouraging start for Shaun Tait.  
  two slips. Not impressed, first time in Sri Lanka for Tait.
Nobody is going to take a backward step here. That is just what Shaun
Tait really needs. I hope there is a strong elastic band in there
because it is very close to snapping and we have had one
delivery. There is a lot going on right out there in the middle. The
umpires, even called and Tony Hill will have to get a firm grip right
now    even called.    Ian Gul up. Shaun Tait with his first delivery,
he pulls away. And Ian gold has got in amongst them, Ricky Ponting has
had to say a few words as well. Two slips for Tait. It has gone
straight to Cameron White at second slip, Eto'o has won that contest,
Dilshan stays with a short one    Tait has won that contest. Dilshan
lost the plot for a moment. Cameron White takes the catch at second
slip. A carp double height, he is not
going to drop those, Dilshan    a comfortable height.
He is out the 4th.    he is out for four. Sangakkara, Sri Lanka's
captain. Brett Lee. That has been caressed a way. It is a chase for
Michael Clarke. Straight into it. Now Brett Lee has decided to come
around the wicket to Sangakkara. Pushed away, with authority. Giving
chase... but it will beat him. tends to bowl in very short spells
so Watson has been given the ball, through the gap on the offside,
beautifully played, typical Kumar Sangakkara. The weight on the back
for it, then comes forward as he saw it was nice and full, lovely
shot. It seems to be more and more
important that some body in the top 3/4 puts together a big three 
figure score, it gives the backbone of the innings and allows you to
maximise your score. Brett Lee around the wicket now, just
changing his line. It is in the air... what a catch,
what an unbelievable catch, brilliantly taken by Smith. That
was a short delivery, it was going like a rocket to the boundaries.
Who pulled Tharanga is out.    Google Tharanga. That highlights
how good that was, brilliantly taken at backward point, that is
the end of Tharanga, he has gone for 6.
Mahela Jayawardene, 33 years of age, a wonderful player, he is now out
in the centre. It is in the air... no second slip and that will go for
four, that would have been a regular second slip catch, Brett
Lee decided he wanted his man on the drive and as a result,' for
more.    four more. That has gone far 9, away from the fielder in the
deep.    that has confined. 50 comes up
for Sri Lanka, what a fascinating battle we have on our hands    that
man at mid off to. That was a pretty shot and the crowd is on its
feet, Sangakkara has played a classical straight drive.
He is a stylist driver of the ball, what good timing by Jayawardene,
Brett Lee dives, but in vain, beautifully struck' 4th to the
offside, a magnificent rise    beautifully struck'' four.
Hesitation, must be a problem here. He has hit the top of the stumps.
It is going to go upstairs for a referral, Steve Smith is the
fielder, a little push into the covers. Sangakkara went, he stopped,
he paused, and this is a terrific throw. It has just flipped the
bails off, must have only just touched the top of the bails.
is going to be a very disappointing scoreboard, listen to this crowd,
you can hardly hear them, they are so disappointed. Mahela Jayawardene
and his run out. A great piece of fielding from Steve Smith, he has
gone for 23. It make the 8 overs since we had a
boundary, but still 30 overs to go for Sri Lanka    it may be. The
singles are coming freely. The run rate has dropped down to 4.4. We
did have some rain last night. That has been slapped away. It has gone
for four, a great shot from the skipper.
That's his half century and beautifully played, just nudged
away on the offside, so important from Sri Lanka's point of view that
they keep going and get a big total here, it has been a while since he
got a century. 49 against Pakistan and 37 not out against Kenya. They
will be looking for two? No, they settle for one, that single brings
short, nicely cut away, this is the sort of shot you see played a lot
by Sri Lankans. There are a number of things Kumar Sangakkara and the
Sri Lankans need to consider, if there is whether, they need to be
mindful of the Duckworth Lewis law. There is a mix up here, but there
is a fumbled. If that had been picked up quickly and thrown back
to the bowler's end, they could have been the chance of a run out.
Let's have another look. It was Smith, moving very quickly to his
right, just not getting hold of the ball. Some seriously dark clouds
gathering. There is the projected scores, if they stay at their
current run rate, they are only just getting over 200. The Sri
Lankans will be looking for a minimum of 250, at 6 per over from
this point. A light breeze, but also some clouds rumbling, it is
very warm and humid out there. That's well played, beautifully
played, a lovely leg bly bly, slightly off line, Samaraweera
managing to judge the pace on the ball beautifully. It went flying to
the boundaries. The run rate has dropped. That is a beautifully
played shot. The 50 partnership between Sangakkara and Samaraweera
comes up, they are doing a good job here. Jayawardene are was the key,
he was run out for 23, this is a good recovery but still a long way
to go.    Jayawardene was the key. That has been clobbered away for
four, he finds the gap, a full toss from Smith, and gleefully accepted
by Kumar Sangakkara. The crowd starting to get really active now.
They know a thing or two about the Colombo weather. That has gone fine,
Sangakkara looking good as the rain takes over the action here in
sweetly once again. The highest score by a Sri Lankan Captain. It
has become a steady drizzle. It covers are being drawn into the
playing field, which is unfortunate because this is the last thing that
this game wanted   an interruption because of rain. But we have it.
The crowds don't like it, we do not like it. We have a little pause
because of the brain.    because of the rain. That score board has been
stuck like that for almost an hour off. It is still pouring down in
Colombo. If this continues the match will have to be abandoned and
it is one. It. Unfortunately the rain did not revenge, and much to
the frustration of the packed house, the game was abandoned with Sri
Lanka will set on 146 3. The Captain Sangakkara or was on 43 not
out. It was a fiery start to the match. Besides earn one point each
with Sri Lanka remain in second and Australia Thursday in Group A. It
looks extremely likely that it will be that Top four which qualify for
be that Top four which qualify for the finals. I have come into
Penygraig's commentary box to have a chat with him. Rain pelting down
just does the match was becoming a corker. Very unfortunate, because
this had the makings of a fantastic game. I thought it was relatively
evenly poised, but there was a little turn and a little bounce.
That was going to get more so when the Sri Lanka and eventually got
their hands on the ball. So very disappointed. Also excited about a
rematch and it will be good to see these two terms playing each other
again. There is a chance that they could get drawn against teacher in
the semis and if they make it through to the finals they could
have a go weighty Thabo then. They look the sort of sites that could
end up having a very close fought match. I do not think it will be
large it was at the last World Cup when it was so one sided. Judging
by what happened here, especially in these conditions. It looks like
Sri Lanka will go with a policy of three spinners, whereas Australia
will go with the pace men. Thank you very much for the moment. Let's
move on to England, who, after that disastrous defeat against Ireland,
need to bounce back in them match against South Africa.
The England batsmen Jonathan Trott. Immediate thoughts in the dressing
room after the defeat against Ireland. Reflection from the guys  
pretty honestly, we did not do well. We did a few things in the
beginning with the ball, very disappointed. We need to pick up
our socks. A how difficult will that be? Not very difficult. We
have played a lot of cricket over the last couple of months, so the
guys are very confident and know their game very well. It is about
stepping up to the plate. We are under pressure for these next three
games. South Africa starting on Sunday. Dear subscribe to the
under achievers tag their choosing to have got an? I think they are a
very good team and no one has a divine right to blame. It is about
performing on the day. But it is dangerous to label teams,
especially those you are going to be playing against. I have caused
you know a few of them. He played under 19 cricket with Graham Smith.
How much in touch are you with them? How worldy get on with them?
Not in touch, I would not say that. I know the guys, playing cricket
with them and against them. It will be a great day come Sunday and very
exciting for the viewers. remember reading that a few people,
Duncan Fletcher for instance, saying that whenever he played
against South Africa he would find the extra stride that helping lift
his game against them. Are you the same? Every time I play for England
it he's the same as the next door the previous times. It is about
staying focused and on top of your game with the job at hand and pay
you can approach the situation you find yourself in. Conditions in
Chennai are very different to Bangladesh. How well England cope
with that? Definitely more humid. We have performed well in humid
conditions in Durban where we performed really well against South
Africa. In Brisbane we did really well. Especially in the last half,
will you would think that teams fade away in the humidity, we got
stronger. Do you fancy a bowl out here? I would not mind. It has been
difficult, but a few of the guys probably gained confidence for some
a few guys were disappointed with their performance with the ball.
The guys on the field did not back them up the way you would have
wanted them to. Very difficult conditions to bowl then and Desert
Team you have to be right behind dollars. It was a high heat run a
tournament. a lot of England fans would have felt deflated after
Ireland. What Kenny say to encourage them? We are a very good
team and we played very good cricket. We had a bad day against
Ireland, but it is important that the team that we focus on playing
100 good overs per day. We play for England and remember who we are
represented. And the guys definitely did. It is not as if we
go out and have a bit of a laugh   we take it very seriously. England
are not struggling with the bat. The likes of Jonathan Trott are
doing their best. Jonathan Trott played magnificently in Australia.
He is going very well. This 1,000 runs that he has in one day
international cricket surprised me. I did not think he had done as well
as that. To be up there with Richards and Kevin Pietersen is
very good. He is also very reliable. It seems to me he has the ability
to stay calm and that is what they need. Did you think he would be at
this level 18 months ago? I did not have a view, I did not see very
much of him. From the first time we saw him in Australia it was clear
that he had very good footwork. He plays the cover drive that very
well and is very strong on the leg side. I had heard a few vibes that
he was not necessarily the most popular guy in the team. But the
truth is that if you keep scoring runs, you get more and more popular
and right now he is Top of the Pops. We heard that Kevin Pietersen has a
hernia but will play through that and have the operation afterwards.
One would expect him to keep going as that is the kind of thing you
can put off unless it gets extremely serious. He would want to
wait because he would want to be part of this World Cup, very
important from England's point of view. It is disappointing because
he will miss out on the IPL, which will have heard his hip pocket. I
should not think people worry about that too much, though. The
important thing is that he plays for England in this World Cup.
I get your thoughts on the West Indies bus being attacked by angry
fans? It is disappointing to hear that. We know that he Bangladeshi
his love their cricket and were obviously disappointed. I do not
understand why they would want to take it out on the West Indies.
Apparently they had a go at their Captain. On it is disappointing,
but then again what you say? There is nothing you can do to change
that. It sounds as if it was quite nasty. One or two West Indians got
a bit of a fright. Rocks were thrown into the bus and there was
glass flying around. Thank you attorney. Let's hear from England
skipper Andrew Strauss and South Africa Captain Andrew Smith as they
prepare to face each other tomorrow. First of all, thoughts on the
security issues yesterday. On we got off the plane yesterday and
were a bit shocked about what had happened. Not at all nice to see
those things. We have to trust security and management to take
care of that. Hopefully it will not happen again and a lesson will be
learned. It is hard for me as I was not there. Why do not do what the
situation was. Clearly security is very important and as far as we are
concerned we have had many trees. England, South Africa is always a
very big game and very competitive. We look forward to it. The Danes
have been exciting to watch and I expect Lonrho will be no different.
We expect to perform very well. format of this World Cup means you
have to move on very quickly from defeat and look forward to the next
game. Keighley there are some lessons we have learnt from Ireland,
   clearly. It is the healthiest thing for a side, anyway. We are
very excited about this game. In a lot of ways we are in more familiar
territory   we know their players better. We have had success against
South Africa before. It is something that as a side we have
always done   bouncing back when we have had a poor performance. They
are a very proud team and they have had some good times in the past few
years. Their performances have been credible over a long period of time
so you have to respect them and know that they have the ability to
play really well tomorrow. We have prepared for the best England team
tomorrow and we expect them to bounce back. Obviously Ireland
would have heard them a lot and it was terrific in the spirit of the
World Cup to watch them get the victory, but I hope tomorrow will
be a very different game. It has been tough. Some of us might
bowlers have had an injury day off and they are coming back in. None
of them are happy with the form they have shown, but there is still
an opportunity for us to win this World Cup and to improve and react
bedded to these conditions. We have not done it so far. Conditions are
befriend to Delhi. It is a lot warmer here but it looks like a
normal Chennai wicket. We studied our preparation in Chennai for the
tournament.    started our preparation. A very hard, dry
wicket with no grass. We are not sure about the spinners, but there
will be something in it for at least some of the bowlers in some
point in the game. Things can change very quickly in the game of
cricket. Absolutely. The most important thing is to retain belief
in yourself and the other senior team. We have beaten South Africa
and Bangladesh and the West Indies are lots of times before. If we win
three games we are definitely into the quarterfinals. Tony, what a
match we have tomorrow. Had you see it going? I will be looking for
some improvement from the England team, especially the bowling. I
will be keeping a close eye on Anderson, assuming he plays. I am a
little worried that England's bowling and their ability to
restrict the opposition. They need to do something about that and I am
sure the hierarchy will be concentrating on it. As far as
their batting is concerned, I think they are going really well.
Hopefully they will bat first and create a situation before South
Africa succumbs to the scoreboard pressure. South Africa seem to have
a good all round game. They have one of the best fast bowlers. He
has probably the best strike rate in world cricket and if he can get
a few wickets early on then he will be good. England need to work hard
or so, do they? Yes. Sometimes you can work overly hard at things and
they did not come right. On other occasions you can just relax a bit
and let it happen. The hard work has already been done and they just
made a few silly mistakes. Do you think Ireland planned put up a good
fight? Kevin O'Brien is the factor I suppose and can he do it again is
the question. If he does, I would love his IPL contract, because the
whole of India will want a piece of him. I doubt it very much. A think
India are a very strong side and they will make a lot of runs
against the Irish attack. It will be a case of whether O'Brien can
fire again. They should not have much of a problem playing in front
showing against Bangladesh. I do not think they will. The ease such
Etudes expectation, especially from a tangle Clare and others of the
other top players.    handled go. They will go out relaxed and who
knows what will happen. You can catch all the best of the action
from the England vs South Africa match tomorrow plus highlights from
India vs Ireland. Join us from 11pm on BBC Two. There is a chance for
an early viewing on the BBC sport website. There is commentary of the
whole of the England game on Radio 5 Live Sports extra from 345 in the
