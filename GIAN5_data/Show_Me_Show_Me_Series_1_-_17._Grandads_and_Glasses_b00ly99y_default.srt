  Ah!
  It's a special day. Granddad Stuffy is going to visit us.
  Yes.
I can't wait to see him. We'd better do something special.
  We're going to learn a song to sing to him. He likes songs.
  Oh, yes.
  What else does he like?
  Games.
  Yes.
  How about skittles?
  He'll like that.
But first, Stuffy wants us to make a present for Granddad Stuffy.
  Oh! It's the Choo Choose.
Ooh! What have we got?
Ah!
Glue, a picture of Stuffy...
..some card and red tissue paper.
Hmm.
I know. Let's make...
a present for Granddad Stuffy.
We could make a photo frame.
Let's put some glue in the middle of the card,
and stick this picture of Stuffy,
with the tomatoes, in the middle.
There. And Granddad Stuffy loves tomatoes, so why don't we...
glue the top...and then...
..make some tomatoes by tearing and scrunching up
bit of tissue paper?
One...

Let's put more glue at the bottom...
..and make some more tomatoes.

  to Granddad Stuffy.
Stuffy, somebody's coming up in the lift. I think it's Granddad Stuffy.
I have the present ready.
Is everyone ready? Mo Mo, Stuffy, Miss Mouse, Tom, Teddington.
When the lift doors open, everyone wave to Granddad Stuffy. Will you?
  Good.
Hello, Granddad Stuffy!
  Everybody wave!
  Are you waving, too?
  Come on, Granddad Stuffy. Come and see everybody.
  Ah!
  You and Stuffy haven't seen each other for ages.
  Ah!
You remember Mo Mo and Miss Mouse,
Tom, Teddington and all our other friends.
Let's sing Granddad Stuffy's favourite song  
Head, Shoulders, Knees And Toes.
  Join in with the actions as well.
Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes
Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes
And eyes and ears and mouth and nose
Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes.
Fantastic! Granddad Stuffy loved it. He likes watching.
Shall we give Granddad Stuffy his present from Stuffy now? Yes?
  Surprise!
  Oh, I tell you what.
Let me take a picture. Everyone is so happy.
When you have your picture taken, you have to smile and say "cheese"!
You can say "cheese", too. Ask your toy to say "cheese" with us. Ready?
  Chee ee eese!
One, two, three, four, five skittles.
You have to knock them down with a ball.
  It's Granddad Stuffy's favourite game.
  Granddad Stuffy,
are you ready to play? Here's the ball.
Good, good. Let's see how well he does. Granddad Stuffy, off you go.
One, two, three!
Oh! How many skittles did Granddad Stuffy knock over? Can you see?
He knocked over one skittle. Well done, Granddad Stuffy.
  Well done, Granddad Stuffy.
  Stuffy's turn now.
  Oh, OK.
Good luck, Stuffy. Can you knock one down as well? One, two three...
  Oh!
  Hey!
Great work, Stuffy! How many skittles has Stuffy knocked over?
Can you see? One...
two skittles.
  Well done, Stuffy. Time for another photograph.
  We're ready to say "cheese".
  You say "cheese" as well. One, two, three...
Chee ee eese!
Come on. Let's look outside.
Puffs of cloud high in the sky,
What can you see floating by?
A fish finger.
Puffs of cloud high in the sky, Wonderful things floating by.
  Stuffy's showing Granddad Stuffy some more photographs.
  But, Pui,
  Granddad Stuffy can't see them.
  Why?
He's lost something that helps him see clearly. Do you know what it is?
Oh!
Glasses. Oh! Granddad Stuffy was wearing glasses earlier on.
He must have put them down somewhere, Pui.
  Someone wants a "show me".
Show me, show me glasses.
We need to find Granddad Stuffy's glasses.
Glasses come in lots of different shapes.
  What shape were Granddad Stuffy's glasses?
  They were round.
  Yes! And also golden. We're looking for round, golden glasses.
  We are.
Come on, Granddad Stuffy.
I can't see them on the shelves. Teddington,
what do you have here?
Glasses, but not golden. They're black. And not round. They're...
square shaped. We'll have to keep on looking.
Look at Miss Mouse. She's wearing glasses.
But are THEY round shaped?
No, they're star shaped. They look very cool.
Let's keep looking.
Tom, have you seen any glasses? ..Ah!
Look.
What shape are THESE glasses? Are they round shaped?
Yes!
And golden. Tom, well done for finding Granddad Stuffy's glasses.
Granddad's golden glasses. Let's put them on.
There you go.
  Hold on tight to them because...
  It's time to show me, show me your groovy moves.
  Let's have a dance.
Freeze!
Oh!
Granddad Stuffy, you moved, because your glasses slipped down your nose.
Let's put them back up again. And it happens to be time for a story.
Oh, get cosy and comfy.
Sit down with your toy.
Here comes a tale for us all to enjoy.
One day, Teddington Bear decided he needed some glasses to wear.
"Before you wear glasses, it's always best
"to go and have an eye test," squeaked Miss Mouse.
"I'd better visit the optician.
"That's the person who checks your vision," said Teddington.
"I'll come too, if it's all right with you," squeaked Miss Mouse.
So off they went to the optician's shop,
with a tumty tum and a skippety hop.
Inside the shop, there were rows of chairs,
and lots of glasses everywhere.
"I'd like an eye test, please, and Miss Mouse is keeping me company,"
said Teddington.
"Do sit down, Mr Teddington.
"The optician will call you soon," said the receptionist.
Miss Mouse looked through the magazines
while Teddington sat and daydreamed.
"Could Mr Teddington please come in?" called the optician.
"I'm coming too. It's so exciting," squeaked Miss Mouse.
The optician had some fantastic machines
that beeped and flashed and let out beams.
Teddington sat in a special chair.
It went backwards and forwards and up in the air.
"Now, let's find out what you can see.
"What am I holding up? Can you tell me?" asked the optician.
He held up pictures one by one.
"This is fun," thought Teddington.
The first was a dog,
the second a cat.
Miss Mouse was not terribly pleased about that!
The third was a snail on a garden wall
and the fourth was an ant, which was ever so small.
And Teddington saw them all.
"Well done, Teddington," said the optician.
"Now, please could you wear this patch for me?
"I'd like to test your eyes separately."
So Teddington put the eye patch on.
"You look like Pirate Teddington," giggled Miss Mouse.
"Look at this chart for me and tell me what you can see,"
said the optician.
Teddington saw everything very clearly.
At the end of the test, he was given a treat
for sitting nicely on his seat.
And Miss Mouse was given one, too.
"Oh, thank you," she squeaked.
Then Teddington had lots of fun trying all the glasses on.
There were plain ones, patterned ones, large and small.
But he liked the green ones best of all.
"I'll have these, please," he told the receptionist.
"But there is no need. You can see very well indeed,"
said the optician, holding up the results of Teddington's eye test.
"Well, the optician knows best," squeaked Miss Mouse.
"Can't I wear glasses at all?
"Not plain or patterned, large or small?" said Teddington sadly.
"Well, I have some rather special ones.
"You wear them in the sun," said the optician.
So Teddington balanced them on his nose
and practised his trendiest, coolest pose.
They were sunglasses.
Perfect for you, Teddington.
  There's the lift!
I can't wait to find out who's coming to see us.
I must get the shop ready.
  Shop's open.
  Ooh!
It's Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are. Hello, Twinkle!
  Hello.
  How are all the stars today?
I can't see them.
  Pardon?
  I can't see them.
  I didn't quite catch that.
  Ah hem!
I can't see them.
  You can't see them? Why not?
  I don't know.
  Oh, maybe you need glasses.
  Glasses?
I've got a lovely pair here. Try them on.
  Let's put these on. There you go.
How are those?
Can you see the stars?
No.
Oh, dear. Maybe we should try a different pair. Give me those.
How about these?
Very nice! They DO suit you, Twinkle.
Now, can you see the stars?
No.
Oh, dear, oh, dear! I have one more pair of glasses.
They've got your name on them. They're star shaped. Fantastic!
Let's put these on. See if those are better, Twinkle.
Hmm.
Can you see the stars?
No.
Oh, poor Twinkle!
Maybe you don't need glasses.
  Oh.
  I'LL take a look. Let's have a look.
No wonder you can't see the stars! It's daytime.
  Stars only come out at night.
  Apart from me.
Apart from you. But you don't need glasses.
  I don't need glasses?
  No.
Oh.
  Can I have these?
  Oh, all right, then.
  You can have them, Twinkle.
  Oh, thank you.
  Bye, Twinkle.
Hello.
  Huh?
  Hello.
It's almost time for Granddad Stuffy to go home.
But we've got some photos to look at.
Here you are, Pui, with all the toys.
You all said "cheese", which is why you've all got great smiles.
And here I am, when we played skittles.
Granddad Stuffy has his glasses on in the picture.
Oh, yes   Granddad's golden glasses.
Say "Granddad's golden glasses" to your toy.
Granddad's golden glasses.
  There's the lift. It's time to go.
Be sure to come back and see us very soon. We love having you here.
Get your worms ready.
Granddad's golden glasses.
