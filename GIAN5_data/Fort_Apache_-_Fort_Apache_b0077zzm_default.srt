Giddy up! Hah! Git goin'!
Driver! How much further to this Hassenpfeffer, or whatever you call this confounded place?
Hassayampa? Oh, shouldn't be long now.
Over the rise and round the bend.
We should've been there an hour ago!
Don't suppose we could've passed her(?) Might've at that(!)
We'll get you there, soldier boy!
Soldier boy(!)
What a country! 40 miles from mud hole to mud hole!
Mule Creek...Deadman's Squaw... Schmidt's Wells...Hangman's Flats ...Hassayampa!
And at the end of the rainbow, Fort Apache!
Fort Apache! Blast an ungrateful war department that sends a man to a post out here!
  Anyway, I'll be with you. I hated the years you were in Europe.
  Better there than here!
I didn't mean it, Phil, but to be shunted aside after all I've done!
We're comin' in! Practically on schedule! Practically.
  Smooth as a rock!
  How far to Fort Apache?
35 miles south. Were you expected?
  I telegraphed.
  Telegraph don't mean a thing! One day the wire's up, next day it's...doon.
  Ma'am, is there a livery stable?
  No.
  There must be some way to rent a vehicle!
  A what?
  A rig!
Nothing fit for the lassie!
My, that's a real bonnie bonnet!
  St Louis?
  Boston.
  Oh, Boston, Massachusetts?
足 Mighty pretty, Ma!
Oh, my! Would you like a wee cup of tea?
  Thank you, if it's not too much trouble.
  Not a bit!
Clean up right in here.
Son, how about a drink?
Gentlemen, I could use one!
Go ahead, my boy.
< There's your towel! Thanks, Ma.
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am... I thought it was Ma...Pardon me!
Who and what are you, Mister?
Lt Michael O'Rourke, sir, en route for duty at Fort Apache.
  Get in uniform!
  Yes, sir!
  Wash up here?
  Through the lean to.
Soldiers, huh!
YI HAH! Johnny Red...Uncle Festus... Timmy...Uncle Dan!
足 Gentlemen, your manners!
Sgt Mulcahy, with an ambulance and escort for LIEUTENANT... Michael...O'Rourke!
Very good, Sgt. At ease.
At ease, he said!
足 How much you pay? 75 dollars.
I could've swiped one! It's tailor made!
Look at the fit! A perfect soldier!
What do you think of it, Ma'am? Wonderful!
Ma'am, this is my godson... Lt O'Rourke.
Many's the time he's come to me with a wet nose.
Atten shun!
  I am Colonel Thursday. I presume you have been sent for me.
  No, sir.
  Why are you here?
  Escorting the ambulance for Lt O'Rourke, sir.
  Not for me?
You couldn't have been expected, sir.
That's obvious, Mister!
Unless it's the custom to provide transport for Lieutenants and leave Commanding Officers to walk(!)
  You will, of course, sir, accept my ambulance.
  Thank you, Mister. Sgt, we leave in half an hour!
  Sir!
  Give these men a drink on me.
Thank you.
  Oh, may I present Mr O'Brien?
  O'ROURKE, sir!
O'Rourke. This is my daughter, Philadelphia.
How do you do?
Your servant, ma'am.
Four bottles of beer, Ma.
And I'll have the same, with a whisky chaser!
Halt! Who goes there?
LT O' Your new Commanding Officer!
At your ease, gentlemen.
  Thursday!
  Hello, Collingwood.
  How do you do, Mrs Collingwood?
  Well, thank you...Owen.
And this must be Philadelphia!
You don't remember me? Emily Collingwood. Your mother was my dearest friend.
Why, of course! I've heard so much about you!
  We didn't expect you...
  So I see! Captain York!
I am Captain York, sir. I bid you welcome, General Thursday.
A man is what he's paid for. I am paid as a Lieutenant Colonel.
  I had remembered you as a General from the war.
  Very flattering.
  Did you receive my telegraph?
  The wires have been down between us and Fort Grant for two days.
  2 days?
  Fort Grant's 110 miles away!
  Then this dance is NOT in my honour.
  It's a birthday dance, sir.
  Whose?
  General George Washington's, sir.
Shall I show you to your quarters, or will you stay?
  Under the circumstances, I...
  Miss Thursday?
MUSICIANS PLAY "There's No Place Like Home"
Hi, Dad.
Mickey!
Woman of the house... your son is home!
Hi, Ma!
Oh, how fine you look! But you're so tall!
Mike, stand beside the boy so I can see you.
You're exactly the same!
  Now, come and tell me EVERYTHING!
  Ma, you haven't changed... nothing has!
Four years is not long, or did you think I'd be grey?
I'll leave you with your son. Lt Michael O'Rourke, sir? Have I your permission to leave?
Sgt Major O'Rourke may go. Thank you, sir.
足 God bless you this day, Michael!
Boys, I'm no drinking man, but if the sutler's store is open...
If it ain't, I'll break it down!
Dad?
Dad?
Good morning!
It's all right, there's no one here but me, and I've been up for ages!
Did you want to see Father, or me?
Well, neither, really.
  Oh.
  I just called to leave my card.
Oh, how nice!
But, if you don't want to see me, I mean, don't want to see US, then why leave your card?
  I didn't say I didn't WANT to see you.
  You did!
I asked if you wanted to see Father or me, and YOU said, "Neither."
  I meant, I didn't EXPECT to see either of you!
  Who DID you expect? We DO live here!
Why don't you sit down?
  Good morning, fair dancing partner!
  Good morning, sir!
  Relax, Mickey!
I've bad news. You're assigned to me!
  "Michael O'Rourke, Lieutenant, US Army." Leaving cards already?
  He can keep them!
He can't. Protocol requires it.
"A new officer will leave his card with the Commanding Officer."
"He will leave additional cards for the ladies of the family!"
  "The other officers will leave their cards at HIS quarters."
  Right! NOW do you understand?
  A duty call?
  That's right.
But regulations do NOT state that the CO's daughter should receive such calls in her nightie!
  Pish tush! This is a DRESSING GOWN, isn't it?
  I wouldn't know.
  I haven't RECEIVED any cards, anyway!
  Hand them over, Mickey.
  I see, the Lieutenant expected a silver salver.
A silver salver. You drop the cards in that. Do you have one?
Our things haven't even arrived! Why, I slept on a horse blanket!
Atten shun! Sgt Major O'Rourke, sir.
  At ease. Did you say O'Rourke?
  Yes, sir.
Place seems full of O'Rourkes!
  Sound Officers' Call.
  Officers' Call?
  How long have you been in the Army?
  15 years, sir!
Then you've heard of Officers' Call. Have it sounded!
Sound Officers' Call. Now?
No, next CHRISTMAS, you loony(!) SOUND IT!
"War Department Special Orders Number 687.
"Lt Colonel Owen Thursday will proceed to Fort Apache, Arizona, to take command of that post,
"by direction of the Secretary of War, William Stafford."
In compliance with this, I take command, relieving Capt York, who will return to his troop.
Capt Collingwood is relieved of his duties as Adjutant.
Lt Gates is appointed Adjutant. At ease, gentlemen.
I did not seek this command, but since I am here, I intend to make this the finest frontier regiment!
I realise that prolonged duty in a small outpost
can lead to carelessness, inefficiency and laxity in dress and deportment.
I call to your attention that only one of you is properly dressed.
The uniform is not a subject for individual...
whimsical expression! We aren't cowboys,
nor a load of alfalfa freighters!
  Mister...er...Murphy...
  O'ROURKE, sir!
Mr O'Rourke, will you step forward?
Gentlemen, I call your attention to Mr O'Rourke's dress.
Being fresh from West Point, he has not forgotten regulations.
I trust my other officers will remember them in future, ENFORCING them throughout the command!
Understand me, gentlemen, I am not a martinet, but I DO want to take pride in my command!
We here have little chance for glory or advancement.
Whilst some of our brother officers lead well publicised campaigns against the GREAT Indian nations  
the Sioux and the Cheyenne,
we must ward off the flea bites of Digger Indians.
Your pardon, sir, but Apaches are hardly Digger Indians.
You CAN'T compare them with the Sioux!
The Sioux once raided Apache land. Old timers tell me you could follow their retreat by their bones!
I suggest they have deteriorated, judging by the few specimens I've seen.
  If you saw them, they weren't Apaches.
  We'll discuss it later!
The immediate point is that if we don't understand each other now,
  we soon will. Questions?
You may return to your breakfasts.
Capt Collingwood, will you stay?
Gentlemen, are there any questions?
If there are none, I intend to follow orders and have breakfast!
REPORT TO YOUR TROOP...Sir!
  Nothing personal in this, Sam.
  No explanations, Owen. We've never had them before.
  Once I tried...
  There was nothing to explain!
  No, nothing.
You did what you did and got glory.
I did what I did and wound up at Fort Apache.
  Well, you've wound up here...
  No, by thunder! I've not WOUND up!
They won't keep ME buried! I'll find something!
  This isn't glory country!
  I'll take my risks!
Well, all I can do is wish you good luck, and I wish you that sincerely!
Thank you, Sam.
Have a drink?
No, thanks, Owen...it's a little early in the day...
even for me!
Any news about my transfer? Sorry, nothing yet.
  O'Rourke.
  Yes, sir?
  Have some mounts brought for my selection.
  Yes, sir.
  O'Rourke?
This Lt O'Rourke, are you, by chance, related?
Not by chance, by blood. He's my son!
I see. How did he happen to get into West Point?
It happened by presidential appointment.
  Are you a former officer, O'Rourke?
  During the war, I was a Major in the Irish Brigade, sir.
  Still, presidential appointments are restricted to sons of holders of the Medal of Honour.
  Yes, sir.
  Will that be all, sir?
  Yes, Sergeant, it will.
  Good morning!
  'Morning, ma'am.
  Good morning!
  'Morning, ma'am.
  Good morning. Excuse me, could you tell me where Mrs Collingwood lives?
  Right there.
  Thank you!
  Good morning!
  Philadelphia!
I know it's very early to call...
  Nonsense, I'm so glad to see you!
  I was just passing and...
My! What a beautiful sideboard... and those candlesticks!
They were my Aunt Martha's. She died, leaving her fortune to a cats' home and those to me!
They're lovely! Everything is!
  But our place...it's so bare... and so dirty!
  Oh, you poor child!
  And there's no WATER!
  Mrs Collingwood...
  Aunt Emily.
  What does a woman DO in the army?
Our things haven't... we haven't even got a coffee pot!
  Owen Thursday! That MAN! Don't fret, in times of trouble we call on Mrs O'Rourke.
  Mrs O'Rourke?
Mrs O'Rourke.
Martha, where's Mrs O'Rourke? Mrs O'Rourke!
Mrs O'Rourke! MRS O'ROURKE!
  What is it?
  Mrs O'Rourke?
  Yes, Mrs Collingwood!
Yes, Mrs Collingwood?
Mary, this is Colonel Thursday's daughter. This is Mrs O'Rourke, mother of a fine young officer!
  How do you do, Mrs O'Rourke?
  You must be happy that Michael is back.
  I am.
  How does he look?
Why, he looks WONDERFUL!
I mean, he makes a fine officer.
  Mary, this poor child has to set up house.
  I'll see to it!
Well, he IS nice.
足 Right, now let's try it together.
Sir, do you mean this little bitty gun...? < GET IN LINE!
I only asked! < SHUT UP AND PUT YOUR HAT ON!
I'm sorry, soldier, I was only tryin' to tell you.
How's the boy doing?
He's doing fine, but he's an officer and a gentleman and that's no job for a gentleman!
Well, then... Come on!
Would the Lt come to the stables? But these men...they're rough!
The sergeants can take over, sir.
Very well. Sergeants, continue!
Now,
you need to LOOK like a soldier, and that means you have to STAND like a soldier!
Suck in that belly! Pull those feet out! Get that chin up!
Wait a minute, Daniel, darling.
Now, is there any man here from Tipperary?
Is there any man here from Cork?
Any man here from County Sligo?
Sir!
Now, this is not favouritism, but you're now an acting Corporal.
Now, Sgt Shattuck will take you in the Manual of Arms. That is by number   one, two...
Come on, get back in line.
Get on your feet. Get in here.
From your mother and I. He's a beauty!
Thoroughbred... get on, ride him.
Hey, Dad, he's a BEAUTY!
He's a leaper! Go on, take him!
There's Sergeant John McAfferty and Corporal Donahue
They made us march up to the crack in gallant Company Two.
The drums they roll, upon my soul, For that's the way we go.
40 miles a day on beans and hay in the regular army o.
There's Sergeant John McAfferty and Corporal Donahue
They make us march up to the crack in gallant Company Two.
The drums they roll, upon my soul, for that's the way we go...
  Are those recruits, Captain?
  Yes, sir...first day's drill.
  They show promise... a good officer, that O'Rourke.
  West Point training, Colonel.
Buenos noches, Colonel.
Surprise!
What do you think of your new quarters?
  Did you do all this yourself?
  Naturally, even moved the piano(!)
No, Mrs Collingwood and Mrs O'Rourke helped me.
Mrs Collingwood gave us all this and Mrs Grayson gave us Great Uncle Abraham. He was famous!
Mrs Tompkins gave us that chair and Mrs Gates gave us the stool, but it doesn't quite match.
  And Francisco gave us Guadalupe.
  How do you do?
She's our cook!
I'm proud of you. Someday, you'll be a proper soldier's wife.
  Dr Wilkins wanted you to have this. It's rump sprung but...
  What?
..but very comfortable. And I helped with the dinner.
I'm sorry...I forgot to tell you. It does that sometimes.
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir, but Fort Grant is flashing an alarm.
  Have any of our patrols reported, Mr Gates?
  No, sir.
  Keep the wires open. I'll return to headquarters immediately.
  Sir.
  My cap and gloves... what's your name?
  Guadalupe.
  But, Dad...dinner!
  Don't wait for me, I may be hours.
  There'll be other dinners, Phil.
  Yes, Dad.
Pobrecita, Senorita!
It's all right, Guadalupe, we'll cook other dinners together.
Phil! Good evening.
Oh, you're having a party! I'm SO sorry!
Come in. It's just a welcome for Lt O'Rourke.
Your servant, ma'am.
She couldn't have timed it better!
足 No, indeed!
Who shall get this prize? The host!
I don't trust you(!) No, she shall sit next to Captain York.
Lt O'Rourke can look at you!
  That's not fair!
  Why?
  Because YOU have to look at HIM!
  Wine?
  No, thanks.
  Good girl.
  Were you born there?
  No, Pomfret. I was named after my mother.
  Was she...?
  No, Pawtucket. She was named after my grandmother.
  Then she...
  No, Provincetown!
Let's talk about horses. Do you ride, Pawtucket...Phil?
  Yes.
  Good. We'll have to order an officer to take you riding.
Let's leave the gentlemen to their cigars, Phil.
Have a cigar, Kirby.
It's so wonderful to have you here at the post.
  Oh, I think you'll get along even without me.
  Without?
  We're just marking time. Sam has applied to West Point, as Instructor.
  I didn't know. When are you going?
Going? Going where? I'm not going to leave my own party!
Phil meant to the Academy, Sam. < Oh, that!
Soon, I hope! But they may REJECT me!
Oh, Sam...Sam, they couldn't!
  They've had my application a long time.
  You know the army, Sam.
  And I know its opinion of me!
  You know OUR opinion of you, isn't that enough?
You know what the men think, sir!
足 Captain, Lieutenant, my compliments.
We ell, then... Oh, Genevieve
I'd give the world
To live again the lonely past.
The rose of youth was dew in pearl'd,
But now it withers in the blast.
I see thy face in every dream,
My waking thoughts are all of thee.
Thy glance is in the starry beam
That falls along the summer sea.
Oh h, Genevieve,
Sweet Genevieve,
The years may come, the years may go,
But still the hands of mem'ry weave
The blissful dreams
Of long ago.
Bravo, Quincannon!
Thanks, Quincannon. One before a meal.
Take him back to the guard house.
There was Sgt John McAfferty and Corporal Donahue...
A man comes to serenade a lady and finds her husband and half the regiment there! I'm crushed.
You only serenade when husbands are around!
Yes, seeing what a sorry figure I cut, the husband takes pity on me and brings out the port!
Ah, Collingwood!
This is blackmail, but you'll...
I know where it is! Last time I looked there were 4 bottles. I expect to find my property intact.
Insolent man! > It's here! An honourable man!
Since this is an occasion, your glasses.
Let's drink a toast to the young people.
Miss Thursday? Mickey?
  Then you WILL go riding with me?
  Of course...if you really want me to.
To the Colonel's lady and Mickey O'Rourke, here's luck.
They'll NEED it!
Men, today we're gonna put you on the horses...no more walking.
And by the time we get through with you, you'll be riding like senators!
Your rough riding sergeant will be Sgt Beaufort.
Gentlemen, this is a horse.
You will observe that it has no saddle.
It's easier for you to stay on without one.
Did any of you serve with the Southern Army in the war? Yes, sir!
I served proudly with Bedford Forrest!
I am proud to shake your hand!
Perhaps you'll buy me a drink? An honour.
  You're an acting Corporal.
  But...
  Please, Sgt Mulcahy!
And now, gentlemen, this gallant member of the greatest cavalry that ever lived...
will show you Yankees how to ride!
See how easy it is? Gentlemen, to your horses! Who will be first?
Come on, get up again!
If you fall off, get on again!
It's a custom in the army, that if you fall off, you mount again like a gentleman!
Come on! Get back on that horse again!
Heels close together! Get with it!
I beg to report I lost my Yankee cap!
Thank you, sir! Thank YOU, sir!
  Isn't this wonderful? What's that over there?
  Blue Mesa.
  Can we go there?
  It's not as close as it looks, Miss Thursday.
  Are you anxious to return?
  Oh, no, Miss Thursday!
Don't you like the name Phil, Michael?
Of course I do, Phil.
  That's where the telegraph line is. That's our main headache around here.
  You mean where the smoke is?
Smoke?
  Is it an Indian signal?
  No...it's not an Indian signal!
The line went dead in the middle of the last word.
Meacham reports Diablo's band decamped, last seen heading s o u t...
South, or southeast, or southwest!
  Which means they may cross 10 or 200 miles away!
  I'm AWARE of that, Captain!
  Think they're trying to join Cochise?
  Yes, sir.
  Are these the three main passes to Mexico?
  They are the ones the Apache use most.
  York, you and Mr O'Rourke take a troop and patrol...
  Mr O'Rourke is not on the post, sir.
  Why not?
  He's riding, sir, with your daughter.
  How long ago?
  Three hours past, sir.
  Are you sure?
  Positive, sir.
  Blasted fool!
  Doesn't your son know this country is not safe?
  Your daughter is is safe with him!
SAFE, with Apaches on the warpath?
Collingwood, take out a patrol! York, pass the word to A and B.
Full field equipment and rations!
Colonel Thursday!
Repair wagon, sir, burned. Two troopers, Barry and Williams, dead, roasted.
My daughter saw all THAT?
  Yes, sir.
  I'll take your report inside!
  Are you all right, Phil?
  Yes, Dad, I'm all right.
Take her inside, will you?
They must've jumped them at sundown.
25 or 30 Mescalero Apaches. I found this.
Blood.
  Apaches carry off their dead.
  Mescaleros all right. Diablo's band.
  The trail led south?
  It headed that way, but...
You didn't follow it to find out?
No, sir. I couldn't take that risk with...Miss Thursday.
Your caution, Mr O'Rourke is commendable, but a bit belated.
My compliments on your report.
It speaks a knowledge of the Indian which was NOT learnt at the Academy.
But I call it to your attention that in taking my daughter riding without bespeaking my permission,
you have behaved more like an uncivilised Indian than an officer and a gentleman.
If I have not made myself clear enough, Mister,
I will add this   You will NOT again ride with my daughter...
and for reasons which I feel it unnecessary to go into, you will avoid her company in the future.
  But...
  I speak to you, not only as your CO,
but as Philadelphia's father.
I am within a father's rights, Captain. My daughter's life is precious to me!
  And to me, sir.
  Then you will all the more readily bow to my wishes.
(Yes, sir.)
Now, Mister... you say the break was here?
Yes, sir.
Captain York, send a detail to repair the wire and bring back the bodies.
  Sgt Major, assemble a platoon...
  I said a DETAIL   an officer and 4 men!
  But...
  I am NOT running a debating society!
  A detail. I will command...
  Mr O'ROURKE will command!
  60 rounds per man...
  That's a lot of ammunition. 30 will be ample!
  30 will be ample.
And 18 per pistol. You'll call for volunteers.
Colonel's permission to volunteer?
Permission refused. Carry on!
You will leave in the quarter hour, Mr O'Rourke.
Michael! You know what's expected of you? Sure, Dad, I know.
Go get Quincannon out of the guard house!
Get Mulcahy, Shattuck and Johnny Reb. Tell them they're volunteering for an extra hazardous duty!
Say the regiment is proud of them!
You spoke of a platoon from A Troop.
I suggest you assemble it.
  We leave in 30 minutes. I will command, you will accompany.
  We're gonna trail the wagon?
At a striking distance.
Collingwood, remember the paper that Capt Robert E Lee wrote when he was at the Point?
The one on the trap as a military weapon?
I do not share the popular view of Captain Lee's ability as tactician,
but that paper impressed me.
In particular, the manoeuvre Genghis Khan employed in the Battle of Kinsha in 1221. You recall?
  Assemble the men, Captain.
  Yes, sir.
  No debate this time?
  No debate, sir, and no questions!
Troop is ready, sir.
You're not properly uniformed, Captain. Nor are your men. They look like scratch farmers!
Hats should be creased and galluses covered.
Yes, sir.
By the column of twos, Captain.
By twos, by the right flank... FOLLOW!
Woman, go on about your business.
Get busy with the wire, Sergeant.
All right, men, get out the blankets and work quickly!
Barry and Williams! Many a pint I had with them!
Johnny Reb, drop it! Let's get out...FAST!
Bugler, raise those colours to full staff.
Meacham!
  The place looks deserted!
  He's here all right!
With the Colonel's permission?
The door is open, sir!
  Open the shutters and get the stench out of here!
  Meacham!
  Well, Mr York...
  Let's go, Meacham!
  Another exile in our wilderness!
  Colonel Thursday, our new CO.
  Your servant, Mr Thursd...
  COLONEL Thursday!
I pay no attention to titles.
I don't believe in titles. We're all His children, even the savages entrusted to my care.
  I feed 'em...
  Rot gut whisky!
I have a licence!
Spirits have their medicinal uses. This is an unhealthy climate. Would the Colonel like a drink?
Your health!
Mr Meacham, some Indians have left the reservation...
Yes, Diablo and 30 others. Ungrateful dogs!
  I treat them well. I have goods for them to buy...
  Shoddy trash!
No! Mister...COLONEL Thursday, you know how children are... they like their bright toys!
  Winchester 7 shot repeaters AREN'T TOYS!
  Captain,
  am questioning Mr Meacham.
  YES, sir!
Right, sir!
There's no reason, to your knowledge, why a band of Apaches should go on the warpath?
  Not the warpath...misguided, maybe...
  But two of my troopers are dead   tortured to death.
  How can you be sure they were my Apaches?
  We've taken Diablo and his band. They'll be here soon.
Assign a troop to keep them here! I've told Mr York THAT all along!
How can I be responsible for all these savages?
Two of your men have been killed. Men serving their country as I am. If high handed Mr York...
  You MEALY MOUTHED...
  Captain York!
Mr Meacham is a government representative! Respect that!
  May
  say something, sir?
  What?
No troop will keep the Apaches here unless they want to stay here!
Five years ago we made a treaty with Cochise. The Apache clans came to live on the reservation.
They lived here in peace for two years.
  Then Meacham was sent by the Indian Ring...
  Lies!
  ..the most corrupt political group in history!
It began   whisky but no beef, trinkets but no blankets. They turned into drunken animals!
So Cochise did what any decent man could, he left and took his people into Mexico.
  He broke his treaty!
  Rather than starve!
  I DEMAND you enforce the law!
Make any DEMANDS through OFFICIAL channels, Mr Meacham!
  NEVER again use that word to me!
  No offence, sir.
  Ready, sir. >
  Lead the way. Come along.
  Where?
  Your storehouse!
  It's empty!
  Colonel Thursday, I protest!
  Put it in writing!
  What's in these boxes?
  It's marked "Bibles", sir.
  Yes...
  Open them!
  What's this scale for?
  Weighing government beef rations.
I seem to have gained 75 pounds suddenly(!)
  Bibles, sir(!)
  Sgt, pour me some scripture!
  What's this? Brimstone and sulphur?
  I'm entitled to keep it!
  Your licence permits whisky. THIS is not whisky!
  Frontier whisky.
I've tasted most things. Sgt, are you a judge of whisky?
  Well, sir, some say I am...and some say I'm not.
  Tell me what this is.
Well...it...it's better than no whisky at all, sir.
Strike a match.
Since it isn't whisky...
..and since it seems to be a highly inflammable liquid, my only course is to DESTROY it!
I protest! I'll write Washington! >
  I'll have you BUSTED!
  Mr Meacham, you are a stench in the nostrils of honest men!
If I could, I'd hang you and leave your carcass for the buzzards!
But, as you are a government representative, I pledge you my protection!
What about these Winchesters, sir?
Their pins are bent. Sgt Mulcahy, straighten them with this!
You heard what he said... destroy it!
Destroy it, he says...
Well, boys...we've a man's work ahead of us this day!
  Unlock the door!
  Michael...
Michael...
PRIVATE Mulcahy...
PRIVATE Shattuck...
PRIVATE Quincannon...
PRIVATE Beaufort...
I'm ASHAMED of you! You're a disgrace to the regiment!
If there was a regulation, I'd make you take the TIPPLER'S OATH!
Michael...
Volunteers for the manure pile...
Hip, hip, hip, hip,
All together men... There was Sergeant John McAfferty and...
If you found Cochise, would he believe you?
Cochise knows I've never lied to him. If you assure him decent treatment...
I confess, he interests me.
The Eastern newspapers... I didn't realise Cochise was so well known.
Oh, he's well known! He's laughed at every troop these 3 years.
Six campaigns...he's out generaled, out fought and out run us!
That's just the point, sir. An army won't make Cochise come back, but a man he trusts might persuade him.
A carbine on the spine persuades, too!
I'll go in unarmed, sir. I can't fight my way in. I either walk in, or...
The man who brought Cochise back...
  I'm for it! How many men will you need?
  Just Sgt Beaufort...
  PRIVATE Beaufort!
He speaks Spanish, so does Cochise.
  Shouldn't you take another officer?
  Sgt Beaufort...
  Private Beaufort!
..he was a major in the Confederate army   an aide to Jeb Stuart.
  Mm...I remember CADET Stuart!
  (Quite.)
  You say something?
  I said "quite", sir.
  I will proceed at once if you have no questions.
  Er...what?
  Questions?
No, no questions. Proceed, Captain, and take your ex rebel. That is all.
  Ready, Sgt Beaufort?
  Yes, sir! Anything is better than shovelling..
  That's what I thought! Let's go.
Private Mulcahy... my compliments, sir!
Officer's pet! Officer's pet, that's what he is!
  How's your hang over?
  Espantosa!
  Here.
  Sir, you're the nicest Yankee I've ever known!
Por la tierra de mi madre.
Well...
let's go!
KNOCKING > Quincannon, wait till pay day!
Having dinner? Well, yes, I will have a cup of tea...and if you urge me, I may even take some pie!
Good evening, Lieutenant. I haven't seen much of you lately.
  Phil...Miss Thursday, I...
  I had hoped you might call. You did leave your card, didn't you?
  And isn't it proper for an officer to call after leaving his card?
  It would be...
The Colonel forbids it.
Well, if a young man hasn't enough gumption to address a young woman...
even if her father IS a Colonel, then I don't think he's as brave as I think!
  Do you, Mrs O'Rourke?
  No, I don't!
  Ma'am, your father is Michael's Commanding Officer and must be obeyed! You'd best go.
  Michael!
Sit down, dear. You, sit too! And YOU...have you nothing to say?
Or have ALL your manners gone?
I'd say a lot IF I could get a word in! MISS...Miss Thursday...
if I thought it mattered to you if I spoke to you or not...but I didn't believe you felt the same way.
What way was that, Lieutenant?
Well...I...
Miss Thursday, if you'll just step outside...
Senorita, su papa el coronel ahi viene muy enojado!
The Colonel, he come! He VERY angry!
He know she here!
Phil, I'm here to bring you home.
  I'm not ready to leave, Father.
  Won't you stay, Colonel?
Another time, perhaps. At least allow me to...
take your hat. I beg your pardon. Come, Phil.
  Colonel...
  I want no words with you just now!
  But...
  Get out of here before I say something I'll regret!
This is MY home! And in my home, I say who is to get out and who to stay!
I remind the Colonel, that his presence is contrary to regulations!
Dad, please...Col Thursday, I'm trying to say that I love your daughter.
  I ask her, in your presence, to be my wife.
  Yes, Michael!
I see... Philadelphia, I ask you to reconsider.
  No, Father.
  I tell you that this is not a suitable marriage for you.
  I can't believe that.
  Sgt Major...
as a non commissioned officer you are aware of the barrier between our classes?
  < I am, sir.
  It doesn't make any difference!
  It makes a difference in the army, as the Sgt Major and his son know.
  The army is not the whole world!
No, but it's YOUR world and it's mine! I'm not young...
  < ..I'll put in for retirement.
  That won't be necessary.
Nor need YOU give up your profession.
  My daughter is not of legal age.
  I will be in TWO years!
Sgt Major, I beg your pardon for coming here without invitation.
  Mr O'Rourke, your pardon for my words.
  I'm not a child and I LOVE Michael!
I will arrange at once for your return to the East. You'll have two years to forget each other.
Mrs O'Rourke.... my respects, ma'am.
  Ready?
  Ready.
Buenas tardes, illustre jefe.
Buenas tardes. Nat hane.
Uno de los jefes de las fuerzas de los estados unidos, el Capitan York.
  Buenas tardes, jefe.
  Buenas tardes.
足 Put the beer on the table, one at each end. Step lively!
Krausmeyer, one sour note and you'll be back shoeing horses!
Now you've got your stripes back, I expect you to set a good example for the men!
Don't worry, Michael darling, we'll be good! Where's the punch?
  Michael!
  You will NOT spike the refreshments this year!
  One bottle?
  No...
  Michael.
Ah...go on, the whole of yous!
Good evening, O'Rourke. Doctor. And Mrs O'Rourke.
Fine DRY night for a dance! Which reminds me... Over there, sir.
Good evening, O'Rourke. Good evening, sir. And Mrs O'Rourke.
足 Sgt Major, I have SO been looking forward to tonight!
The non commissioned officers' dance is the NICEST dance! Don't you think so, Mrs O'Rourke?
  Well...I...
  Sgt Major, will you claim me for a dance?
With pleasure. By the way... There, sir.
Thank you, Krausmeyer.
Again on behalf of the officers of Fort Apache, I wish to thank the NCOs for this grand party!
The food is exquisite and the punch...WOW!
Good evening, Krausmeyer.
And so, as is customary,
'the CO, Colonel Thursday, will lead out our Sgt Major's wife, Mrs O'Rourke.'
With permission... Mrs O'Rourke, may I have the honour?
It will be a pleasure, Colonel Thursday.
And now, Sgt Major O'Rourke will lead out the Colonel's lady, in this case his daughter...
..Miss Philadelphia Thursday.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, take your partners for the Grand March!
Get out of my way, Meacham, or I'll break your legs!
Of course, WITH your permission.
ORCHESTRA STARTS TO PLAY "Dem Golden Slippers"
Rub 'em down, will you?
Captain York!
Well...?
  Cochise has crossed the river, sir. He wants to talk peace.
  Returned to American soil?
Yes, sir. Now, with your permission, I'd like to clean up and join the dance.
  No. The regiment moves out at dawn.
  The regiment?
Cochise says he'll meet with you, me and...Meacham.
We'll go unarmed. I arranged a rendezvous near the Dragoons.
Sgt Major, stop the dance. Prepare the troops to move at dawn.
  Troop commanders meet at headquarters.
  Sir, Cochise will think I've tricked him!
We HAVE tricked him on to US soil and I intend he STAYS here!
Sir, I gave my word to Cochise! No man will make a liar of me!
Your WORD to a savage! To an uncivilised treaty breaker!
  There is no question of honour between an officer and Cochise!
  There IS to me!
Captain, you may have commanded your own regiment in the late war,
but SO long as you command a troop in MINE, you will obey me!
You have your instructions, Sgt Major.
Ladies and gentlemen, officers and non commissioned officers, your attention, please.
By order of the Commanding Officer, tonight's entertainment will end with the next dance.
Then all first sergeants, quartermasters, farriers, cooks and bakers will report to me.
Ladies and gentlemen, the NCOs of Fort Apache
offer their deep regrets.
On their behalf, I thank you for attending this dance. Krausmeyer, if you please...
ORCHESTRA PLAYS "Goodnight Ladies"
Is it to your taste, Johnny?
I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill And o'er the moor and valley.
Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill, Since parting with my Sally.
I seek no more the fine and gay, For each does but remind me
How swift the hours did pass away With the girl I left behind me...
I seek no more the fine and gay, For each does but remind me
How swift the hours did pass away With the girl I left behind me.
It's Capt Collingwood's transfer. It's through!
  Run! Send someone...call him back!
  Yes, Aunt Emily!
  I don't know.
  What IS there to know? Get him!
  Sam's no coward...
  Who's talking about cowardice?
  Don't be a fool, woman! Tom, get Capt Collingwood back.
  No!
Keep this for the Captain's return. Yes, Ma'am.
I can't see him! All I can see is the flags.
It's the encampment, sir. About a mile up. 300 wigwams or more.
Very good. Bugler, my compliments to Captain York. Have him report to me.
  Yes?
  Is that where you were to meet Cochise, Captain?
  Just about.
  My officers will address me as "sir"!
  Yes, sir. Is that all, sir?
  No, it's not.
  I propose to send two troops north, one east. We will converge on the encampment.
  I wouldn't, sir.
I am NOT asking advice, Captain!
The Apache are neither north, east, or in the encampment, sir!
If you'd watched the dust swirls to the south, you'd see they were there!
That's Alkesay. They outnumber us four to one. Do we talk or fight?
You seem easily impressed by numbers, Captain.
However, I'll honour your word to Cochise. Tell him we've come to talk.
  Buenas tardes.
  Buenas tardes.
  Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the chief of the Apaches, Cochise.
  Get on with it, Captain!
Take over, Beaufort.
Tengo el honor, ilustre y jefe, de presentarle el comandante de regimento, el Coronel Thursday.
El Capitan Collingwood... el Capitan York...
y el Senor Meacham.
This is Alkesay, head of the White Mountain Apaches,
Satanta of the Mescaleros...
and the Chiricahua medicine man, named, in Spanish, Geronimo.
  Get on with it, Beaufort.
  El Coronel incita hablar.
Los Apaches son una gran raza,
orgullosos, no hemos nacido para ser esclavizados.
  Su nacion nos hizo la guerra y no nos derroto.
  What did he say?
The Apaches are a great race, sir, never conquered.
  Pero una nacion no debe estar siempre guerra.
  But we should not always be at war.
  Los jovenes mueren.
  Men die.
  Las mujeres cosa canciones tristes.
  Women sing sad songs.
  Los viejos pasan hambre.
  The old are hungry.
  Y por eso con mi gente me fui de los cerros.
  And so I led my people from the hills.
  Entonces vino ese hombre.
  Then came this man.
Un hombre nalvado que no dice la verdad.
Y que ha sembro la enfermedad y el bicho en toda mi nacion!
A free translation is that Meacham's a yellow bellied polecat of dubious antecedents and progeny!
  Cochise's words, of course, sir, not mine(!)
  Matter of opinion!
  Es peor que la guerra.
  He's worse than war!
  No mata solo al hombre, tambien a las mujeres a los ninos!
  He kills women and children as well as men!
  Esperabamos que nuestro gran padre blanco nos protejiera.
  We looked for protection.
  El nos dio una muerte lenta.
  He gave us slow death!
  No regresaremos a su posesion...
  We will not return to your reservation...
  ..mientras es este hombre u otro como el.
  While ANY like that man are there!
  Quitenlo y hablaremos de paz...
  He goes and we shall speak of peace...
  ..se queda y habra guerra!
  ..he stays and there will be war!
  Por cada uno de nostros que usted mate...
  And for each one of us you kill...
  moriran diez hombres blancos.
  ..10 white men die!
  Threats?
  Don't interrupt, sir.
  I WON'T be THREATENED!
Beaufort, you say EXACTLY what I tell you, do you hear me?
  They are recalcitrant swine!
  He's only speaking the truth, sir.
  Will ANYONE take an order?
  What should I say?
  Say I find him without honour!
  He is speaking to the US Government.
We order them to return to the reservation!
  If they've not started by dawn we will attack!
Bugler...sound forward.
  I don't see them...not a one.
  Well, they're down there, sir, among the rocks.
  Have you seen them, Captain?
  I don't have to. I know.
  How?
  Because if I were Cochise, that's where I'd be.
  And that dust cloud?
An Apache trick, squaws and children dragging mesquite.
Very ingenious. You make me think your Cochise has studied under Alexander or Bonaparte(!)
Gentlemen, we charge in column of fours.
  Mounted in FOURS? That's SUICIDE!
Captain York, you are relieved of command of your troop! There is no room here for a COWARD!
At your service, SIR!
Bugler, pick up Captain York's gauntlet.
I'm no duellist, Captain. I will decide whether to answer you with pistols
or a court martial! You remain on the ridge, in safety!
Take O'Rourke with you.
Gentlemen, you have your orders. Are there any OTHER questions?
Captain Collingwood?
No questions, Owen.
Gentlemen, join your troops!
A charge   mounted in fours!
  The mad man!
  I'm to stay with the wagon train...and take O'Rourke with me!
  You'll find Lt O'Rourke with his troops, sir... and thank ye!
  Good luck.
  Good luck, men!
  Thank you, sir!
  Lt O'Rourke, follow me!
  But the troops...
  Mulcahy, take over.
Get out of here, you scut, or I'll belt the pants off you!
  As you were, men!
Carry on, boy.
All right, get them over!
Get to Fort Grant. Tell them where we are. Tell them to hurry! Move!
Trooper...
Trooper...
Stand by your guns, men. Flaherty, you're in charge. I'll be back!
We've dug in on the ridge, sir. Plenty of water and ammunition.
I've sent a courier to Fort Grant. If we can only hold out... get on my horse.
  I'll trouble you for your sabre, Captain.
  My sabre?
  I must rejoin my command.
  The command is wiped out, sir, and we can do nothing about it.
I'm not asking your opinion! When you command this regiment, command it! Your sabre, sir!
Any questions, Captain?
No questions.
  This time YOU were late, Owen.
  You have my apologies.
Sergeant Major O'Rourke, my apologies, sir!
Save them, sir, for our grandchildren!
Hold your fire, men.
(Hold your fire.)
However, gentlemen, I warn you, this may be a long campaign.
Weeks before you have any headlines.
Testing Geronimo is our headline. And glory for you.
He must've been a great man.
And a great soldier.
No man died more gallantly...
  ..nor won more honour.
  Are you familiar with the painting "Thursday's Charge"?
Yes, I am.
It's magnificent. Massed columns of Apaches in warpaint and feathers...
  and Thursday leading that heroic charge!
  Correct in every detail.
He's the hero of every schoolboy in America!
  But what of the others? Collingworth...
  Collingwood!
Oh, of course...Collingwood.
  Ironic, we remember the Thursdays but forget the others.
  Wrong, they aren't forgotten, because they live.
Collingwood and the rest are living, right out there.
They live while the regiment lives.
Pay is 13 a month. Diet is beans and hay.
Maybe horsemeat before this campaign is over.
They'll fight over cards, but share the last drop in their canteens!
The faces may change and the names, but they are there.
They are the regiment and the regular army, now and 50 years from now!
They are better men than they used to be. Thursday did that. He made it a command to be proud of.
  Command is formed, sir!
  Thank you, Sgt Major.
  Now, it's time to move. Questions, gentlemen?
  No, thank you.
Gentlemen, this is my Adjutant...
Lt O'Rourke, who will take care of you.
Mrs O'Rourke, General Thursday's daughter, and THE Mrs O'Rourke!
And this is Michael Thursday York O'Rourke, the best man here! Aren't you, you scut?
I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill And o'er the moor and valley,
Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill Since parting with my Sally.
I seek no more the fine and gay, For each does but remind me
How swift the hours did pass away With the girl I left behind me.
