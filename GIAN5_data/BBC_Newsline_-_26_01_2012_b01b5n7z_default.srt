Good evening. The headlines this Thursday
evening... We hear from the heartbroken
Pseudomonas infection. And they tell us what action they believe
are looking for a full public inquiry and the truth about what
happened. Wider memoirs of this former Secretary of State have set
   upset our most senior judge. How thousands of fish ended up in a
County Down feel. Rory McIlroy leads the way ahead
Tiger and the rest in Abu Dhabi. Meet the young footballers on their
way to the Nou Camp, home of the mighty Barcelona.
There has been a distinct chill in the air and a wintry spell
continues tonight and tomorrow. Tonight on BBC Newsline, we hear
for the first time from the parents of one of the babies who have died
from Pseudonomas. Four infants fell victim to the bacterial infection
during the past two months. In all cases the sources of the infection
were sink taps in hospital neonatal units. Three babies were in the
Royal in Belfast. The little boy we're focussing on tonight died at
Altnagelvin in Londonderry. We approached his parents after they
commented about the deaths on our Facebook page. They wanted to tell
us what happened to try to prevent another outbreak. They've been
talking to our Health Correspondent Marie Louise Connolly.
and then they learned he had acquired an infection from a tap in
the neonatal unit he was being cared for. He was beautiful. He was
very tiny. While a couple acknowledge their son was born
prematurely and was very seriously ill, they say he was showing signs
of improvement. If you had put your finger in his hand what would he
have done? He would grab your finger. He left for just 10 days.
His condition deteriorated after an infection in his bloodstream.
just realised after we buried him that he had died of Pseudomonas.
doctor came to your house to tell you? To doctors came and told us.
As well as visiting a couple, be First wrote to them, confirming
their son had died from Pseudomonas and the sauce had been traced to a
tap. Two consultants from Altnagelvin's paediatric department
expressed simple.    sympathy. They said they believed the sauce was a
tap and think area and have taken measures to eradicate the source.
They say, we hope you can accept we are deeply sorry. According to the
Western Health Trust, they followed the advice from the Public Health
Agency and moved quickly to clean the affected area. The trust said
expectant mothers should be reassured that the room was closed
to new admissions and the tap was dismantled, disinfected and
retested and remains clear of Pseudomonas. Around this time,
another baby, who had also tested positive for the infection, was
transferred to the Royal Jubilee Maternity. While that child had a
different strain of Pseudomonas, according to this letter sent from
the Chief Medical Officer on 22nd December, at no stage was the
Belfast Health Trust advised that a child had died at Altnagelvin.
should have brought out that this infection was about to prevent it
from getting in and killing any other babies. Be as was the
couple's third child. Their first was still.    stillborn when the
second is two years old. Shortly after it was confirmed the child
had died from Pseudomonas, they asked a solicitor to help them
trying prevent a similar outbreak occurring again. If we are looking
for a public inquiry into the truth. Many questions still remain
unanswered by the health authorities here in Derry and in
Belfast. In the meantime, should be Health Minister making    consider
making it compulsory to replace all things and have then neonatal units
across Northern Ireland?    stinks and taps.
I am joined by Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer. Are you
satisfied that everything about this infection and the first baby's
death was communicated to Department of Health and all
medical officials in the Trust's? Let me take this opportunity to
express my deepest sympathy to the parents of this baby. This is a
tragic set of circumstances and I find it difficult to put that into
words. It is a tragic loss. I am deeply sorry for what has happened.
I can only begin to understand the sense of anguish and pain they are
experiencing at this time. It is deeply regrettable. I believe that
we took swift and decisive action to communicate to the rest of the
Health Service that we had a pseudomonas infection in
Altnagelvin hospital and that we had traced the source of that to
two taps were then that unit. is verbally to other trusts?    did
you say verbally. He said it was up to you to answer this. It did not
say that the baby had died or no memo and that the source of the
infection was the sink tap in the neonatal unit. Why was that not in
the memo? This statement was very clear and pointed out the fact that
there were risks in all such units, where patients who are sick and
immunosuppressed. This is not necessarily confined to neonatal
units. There was an important message to get out to staff in
hospitals that appropriate steps need to be taken to prevent, and
that is the important point, to prevent contamination of hand
basins and to ensure... But why leave out the information that a
child had died? I understand that morning, but why leave out the very
important fact that the child had died? Would that not have added a
sense of urgency? It would have created the impression that the
only cause for concern was in relation to a particular trust, of
the Gilford in this case, or a particular male made her unit.   
Altnagelvin in this case.    particular neonatal unit. Any unit
where patients are immunosuppressed, there is an important message about
reinforcing good infection control, to avoid contamination and that
ensured basins are used for the purpose they are intended and
cleaned properly. The letter was very clear about the risk of
outbreaks in these units and the consequences and specific in terms
of the action required to be taken. The minister raised about
ultraviolet light taps replacing the neonatal taps in the Royal.
Should all of the trusts set out in their budgets that neonatal taps in
all of the hospital's been replaced with these new, hi tech caps?
would be missing a point. We saw this tragedy associated with paps.
This is about good infection control practices in our hospitals.
This is about wash hand basin is used solely for the purpose they
are intended and claimed appropriately.    basins. Would be
new help    taps have more? important thing is we avoid
contamination of the taps. Those were lessons learned from England
and Wales. There was a letter in September saying be aware there is
eight potential for contamination of taps. The purpose of reissuing
the letter was to advise that the situation had reoccurred in
Northern Ireland and to ensure appropriate steps were taken. Our
first priority is the safety of patients. Eight I defer joining us.
   thank you for joining us. An extraordinary row has broken out
between Northern Ireland's most senior judge and the former
secretary of state, Peter Hain. The Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan
Morgan, has called remarks about another judge in Mr Hain's memoirs
"unwarranted and wholly inappropriate." Mr Hain says he has
no regrets. Here's our political correspondent Gareth Gordon.
Peter Hain was back in the news today. His memoir is hard to find.
We tracked down three copies in this shop in Lisburn but extracts
in the newspapers have been she seen by Northern iron's top judge.
His verdict is not favourable.    Northern Ireland. It was found that
the Secretary of State had broken the law. Mr Hain said he found a
judge's handling of the case was high handed and idiosyncratic. He
said he thought he was off his rocker and even thought about bring
yet to be Appeal Court. This provoked a response from the Lord
Chief Justice. He said it was highly regrettable that Mr Hain
seeks to call into question the honour and integrity of the trial
judge. He calls the remarks unwarranted and wholly
inappropriate and claims it is potentially an assault on the wider
independence of the judiciary. stand by everything in my memoirs.
I have given an account of this episode, after which I was
exonerated as was the chief of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and
the permanent secretary in the Northern Ireland Office. I have no
regrets about writing it. The row is said to have amused the legal
profession. If every single person I have spoken to he is talking
about this and lawyers are horrified about the situation. I
feel sympathetic to the judge in question and we are supportive of
the statement and reaction of the Lord Chief Justice. Mr Hain is to
get an invite from Stormont's justice committee, which is
reviewing justice appointments. Secretary of State has written a
book and he has definite and outspoken views on this issue...
They said there is no such thing as bad publicity but for some senior
figures in the legal profession, looking at this book closely, Peter
Hain my soon find out if that is true.    may soon find out.
The safety of a road in County Down has been called into question again
after an accident which a man died yesterday. His car left the road
which runs right beside Newry Canal and plunged into the water. It's
led to further calls for more crash barriers on the route. Eunan
McConville reports. This latest accident happened
yesterday afternoon. A local businessman was driving his car
along this stretch and it left the road and plunged into the water. A
specialist diving team was called in but they were unable to save him.
He was a well respected trader in Newry. I have known him for many
years. He has run a successful restaurant and ladies' clothing
shop and also owns a beautiful bar. This is an up standing businessman,
highly respected and liked. There have been accidents and fatalities
of this nature over the years. Geraldine rice and her family were
lucky to survive after their car entered the canal five years ago.
An additional 100 metres of barrier was erected. The road is not safe.
There needs to be more of safety measures put on the road. There
should be speed ramps, speed cameras. You can see how close this
road runs beside the water of Newry Canal. There are barriers at
certain stretches of the road, mainly at corners. The question has
been raised whether there should be more barriers along the road.
would like to see a complete steel barrier from Newry right down to
the border. I do believe this is needed. There is an excellent
barrier in patches but I would like to see a continuous barrier, so
that if a carded he did it would not enter the canal. Lives would be
saved, of that I have no doubt. spokesperson for the Department of
Regional Development, which has responsibility for crash barriers,
says there are no plans to improve the barriers along this stretch of
road but that the Roads Service will consider the outcome of a
police investigation into this recent death.
Still to come on the programme... Why things really did go bump in
the night for people in County Donegal.
And a young footballer from Belfast who is bound for the training trek
of a lifetime with European champions. Whenever have you seen a
field of fish like this? This what a County Down farmer came across
when a lorry load of mackerel veered off the road outside
Killyleagh. Our district journalist Francis Gorman has discovered that
the catch was initially not supposed to be on that road.
The driver was not injured. Holy mackerel! An estimated 20 tons
of it. The lorry was going along the Comber road in the direction of
Killyleagh when it went through a thorn hedge and dropped into this
field. The fish were supposed to have been brought in by boat to
Ardglass harbour yesterday but this was impossible because of bad
weather. I filmed these scenes yesterday for another story.
Instead, the boat went to Bangor. The fish was transferred onto a
lorry to drive to a fish processor in our class. But it never got
there. Today the land owner told BBC Newsline what he saw when he
arrived on the scene. When we looked over initially it was like a
big mirror in the field with the light reflecting from the fish. We
came down anyway and they were starting to get ready to clear the
place up. It started about 6 o'clock last night they really got
into gear and apparently they were working until 2 o'clock this
morning. The field has now been cleared of most of the fish and it
will not go into the food chain. Down District Council says it is
due to be processed into fish meal. Some residents of Donegal got a bit
of a surprise in the early hours of this morning when they were woken
up by an earthquake. It was registered in Buncrana just after
one o'clock this morning. It wasn't major, registering 2.2, but it was
strong enough to create a bit of a stir in the area.
Life as usual in Buncrana today, but it had been a disturbed night
for his son. I heard this big rumble and the whole house shook.
My mum wanted to know what had happened. I knew it was an
earthquake. I thought it was under, I thought it was a storm. But it
was an earthquake. You wouldn't expect that here. It's fair to say
there's not much earthquake activity in these parts but Donegal
is one of two counties in Ireland that has seen quite a lot of
seismic activity. The other is Wexford. That is because of the
number of faults below both counties, tiny cracks in the
Earth's crust. It woke me from my sleep just after 1 o'clock. I
thought, all my God, we are going to have a tsunami, and the house
was vibrating. By was more scared of the thunder and lightning in
November. There was nothing to it. Did you figure out how far away it
is? The earthquake brought lessons to live for these students. Their
school's seismograph recorded it. We got a trace of it so I am very
happy. The machine can be badly behaved sometimes but it was
recording faithfully last night. This is the first air quirk we have
recorded close to home and it is exciting.    earthquake. Most
people here will be hoping for a quiet night tonight!
Or one of the world's leading experts on earthquakes is in the
University of Ulster and he joins me now from close to the epicentre,
just outside Buncrana. Just how unusual is an earthquake in County
Donegal, or anywhere in Ireland. Unusual    small ones are not
unusual. I happen occasionally. we on a fault line? There are quite
a lot of major faults that run through this area. Lough Ness is on
the Great Glen fault in Scotland and back comes across the Irish Sea
and appears north of all crime map.    Buncrana. These earthquakes
happen on those old faults that were formed hundreds of millions of
years ago and they are being reactivated by small changes in
stress due to the rebound of the crust after the ice melted from the
last Ice Age, about 15,000 years ago. So, very small changes in
stress can generate small earthquakes on structures that have
preexisted in the Earth's crushed. Behind me, the fault comes across.
Is there anything that triggers this? Is there anything within our
control at all? Even to give us warning it will happen. No, there's
absolutely no warning, even for a very big earthquakes. You would
think that the Earth's crust would prepare some hard but it doesn't
happen like that and small earthquakes like this will have no
warning. They do just happen as a response to this very, very slow
increase in pressure on these faults. There's no warning.
Fortunately, as the people in Buncrana told you, this was not a
frightening event. The chances of anything major in this area are
very small. It is not zero. One interesting thing about earthquakes
like this, it shows us that it in even one of the safest countries in
the world for earthquakes, the chance of having an earthquake is
never a zero. We always have a possibility. The chances of a
bigger one hour very small in this area. That is good news, at least
they will not have a big one. I gave returning us.
And if you want to add a witty comment to the many that have
already been posted on our Facebook page, the address is there on the
screen. A lot about fish 'n' chips! In a moment, the story of a dream
football journey from some young Belfast soccer players. First,
Austin O'Callaghan's here with news of another impressive young
sportsman. I think you'll recognise him. Rory
McIlroy is enjoying a share of the lead after the opening round of the
Abu Dhabi Championship. The Holywood golfer outshone playing
partners Tiger Woods and Luke Donald with a five under par
opening round of 67. This is Rory McIlroy's first
tournament of 2012. His opening round was not flawless. Remember
him hitting cabins in the final round of the Masters? Today, a
hospitality tent received a visit. It did not put the spectators off.
For every mess had shot, there was a precision shot. An opening round
of 67 put Rory McIlroy in front of his playing partners. There are two
guys established in the game. Tiger Woods is great and Luke Donald is
fantastic. I felt we all play pretty good. I was lucky to score a
bit better than the other guys. It was a nice way to start the season.
There were strong performances from Gareth Maybin and Michael Hoey
matched Tiger Woods' opening round with a two under par 70.
Now a BBC Newsline exclusive. A cross community project is offering
local budding footballers the chance to experience a coaching
session with a difference. They'll travel to the Nou Camp, the home of
Lionel Messi and the European Champions FC Barcelona. Nikki Gregg
reports. When word spread about a coaching
clinic, years per job. When it turned to be in Barcelona, they
came in their droves. Martin Lavery is a community worker. This
programme is to help children develop soccer skills at an early
age. It has the backing of Northern Ireland internationals. Now they
are going a step further. I got a contract with Barcelona and I
badgered him for four months and he agreed to a meeting. We will change
today's with the coaches that take Lionel Messi. We will train at Nou
Camp and then they play on    we will play them, which is unheard of.
They will have the opportunity to work with Barcelona coaches. We are
trying to adapt the Spanish a philosophy on football. It seems
you are never too young to start. The trips will be staggered that
Gerard the year. Players from the Irish League are on board to help
out. They are working on their passing. There are some beginners
and some advanced. A lot of them have potential and could be decent
footballers. The first group will travel to Barcelona at Easter and
there is no doubt which but bomber they are most excited to see. Who
is your favourite player? Will Lionel Messi. He is skilful and he
is the best player in the world. Here is the best? Lie in a messy.
Where you meet him? And I don't know, hopefully. They can dine is
the competition's organisers. Ulster had asked the ERC to 'bear
in mind' the strong Christian commitments of a number of the
team's players and supporters. But tournament chiefs say the game will
go ahead as planned on Sunday April 8th. Ulster have told us they'll

the warmer weather. As temperatures fall this evening, some showers
could turn into snow. It could be I see this evening with temperatures
around freezing or just below.    I see. It is another chilly night and
another chilly morning. Later this evening the showers will ease off.

The breeze will be evident at tomorrow morning making it feel
distinctly chilly and dragging some of those wintry showers over to the

  snowing. Temperatures just above freezing. That is low enough for
some ice. A nasty start to the morning. The showers will ease off
and the wind will these as well. The afternoon will be the better
half of the day. Many places becoming dry and temperatures
eventually slightly higher than today. They will fall away quickly
tomorrow night. Another frost. Saturday morning at a, a sharp
frost in places. This cheeky chappie was spotted in its
Jordanstown this morning. Saturday morning starts off dry and crisp
