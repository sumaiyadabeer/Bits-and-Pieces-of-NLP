Tonight, celebrity and the media, from Marilyn Monroe to a Prime
Minister, blackmailed into bizarre sex, live on TV.
In a week when contemporary stars talked about the price of fame, the
new film explores Marilyn Monroe's inner demons, and her conflict with
celebrity. All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe.
The public's appetite for scandal is laid bear in Charlie Brooker's
parable of a Prime Minister's terrible dilemma. Do we secretly
relish media intrusion. I will be executed.
Plus, hidden treasures brought to light at the Ashmolean museum in

All through this week we have heard celebrities and others expose the
underhand tactics of the tabloids, but they feed a public appetite,
which is hardly anything new. In the 1950s, Marilyn Monroe could
With Marilyn, aims to uncover more about the real woman behind the
public figure. She's here, said the headlines,
everyone now it meant the American film star with the famous shape and
wiggley walk. Marilyn Monroe visited the UK only once, in 1956
the world's most famous movie star, boarded a plane with her new
husband, Arthur Miller. She had come here to make The
Prince and the Showgirl, with the acclaimed actor and director,
Lawrence Olivier, it was her first film as producer and star, and
crucially, a chance to prove herself as a serious actress. But
the production wasn't a happy time for Monroe, who was becoming
increasingly addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol. She
and Olivier clashed over everything, from her lateness on set to her
obsession with method acting. With the marriage to Miller already
crumbling, Monroe felt very vulnerable. Enter 23 year old
assistant director, Colin Clark, the old Eatonian son of art
historian, Keneth Clarke, who was starting his first job in the
business. My Week With Marilyn is based on his memoir of the week he
spent with Hollywood's most memorable actress. She and Olivier
were talking a dlifrpb language. She decided this wuing man, Colin
Clark was someone to trust and befriend, eventhough they had aner
rottically charged few days together, she was able to recapture
her lost childhood with him. Given this is his first feature film,
Curtis has managed to assemble an impressive cast, including Kenneth
Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Dame Judi Devon, and Michelle Williams.
knew Michelle Williams was a great actress, but I didn't know what a
great dancer and singer she was. It was great to surround her with a
great team of people. At the heart of it was Michelle's brilliance. I
love seeing her sing the songs from the tripbstripbs and other times in
Marylin's life    The Prince and the Showgirl, and other times in
Marylin's life. Does My Week With Marilyn manage to give new insight
into the legendary star, or is it just another tribute to a pop icon.
The way that I move That thermometer proves
That I certainly can Sarah, you have written about
Marilyn Monroe, you know her life very well, how well do you think
that Michelle Williams manages so capture the essence of the woman
and the star? It is a performance that is getting a lot of hype. I
have to say I think it deserves it, it is an extraordinarily,
technically remarkable performance. She gets not only Marylin's
mannerisms, she really gets her voice very well, particularly. She
also gets the tremulous that Marylin brought to her performance,
she quivered, she was almost like a humming bird. I think the problem
for anyone playing Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe is Marilyn Monroe
for a reason, it is like trying to play Cary Grant, there are a
handful of people who were transcendant, people use words like
"all chem me" and "magic to talk about her, there is no word for the
presence she has on the screen. Nobody can do that. However good
the performance is, and Michelle Williams can't do that. It is not
her fault, it can't be done. close do you think Michelle
Williams got to the all can he me? You are being    you are being
asked to play an energy. It is in the middle of a pedestrain film, a
film made up of a lot of acting, some acting you will like, you will
like Branagh's Olivier, because he brings Olivier to us, you won't
like Emma Watson, or the lady who plays Vivien Leigh, and within it
is the performance of Marylin, for Michelle Williams it will put her
on the Oscar list. Her performance is a photocopy of a photocopy of a
rumour someone once said about Marilyn Monroe. If you are up on
Marilyn Monroe it is disappointing, if not it is a film of good acting.
The clash between Marilyn Monroe and Lawrence Olivier, who you have
worked with in the past? I did, and Kenneth Branagh is fantastic. He
gets the normality of the man, along with the, the fact is, that
period of time, Olivier wanted to do what Monroe could do, and Monroe
wanted to do what Olivier could do, she wanted to be a great actress,
and he a movie star. He didn't know how to deal with her, she was just
was on the screen, and he acted. I think possibly Michelle Williams
does work from the outside in. And like Marilyn Monroe did, I think
that Kenneth Branagh worked from the outside, like Olivier did,
there is these wonderful moments when he says it's like teaching
Urdu to a badger, and he goes completically, it is so familiar
that, I gets it right.    completely, it is so familiar, he
gets it right. The world of these two huge egos, and then comes the
character of Colin Clark, in a sense an outsider? He was the
weaker part, Kenneth Branagh is brilliant. Michelle Williams, like
you say, it reminded me of Will Smith playing muham med Ali, it is
such an incendiary character. In the novel's so campy, making
comments, he has interesting thoughts, but the guy who is Clark
in the film is bland guy. Firstly, you don't understand why Marilyn
Monroe would invest her faith in him, and secondly, this sexual
thing, which is this erotically  charged relationship. In the book
you realise he has an experience of gay sex in the diary. You think why
don't you sleep with Marilyn Monroe if you have the chance. It raises
two points, if we believe Colin Clark, it is based on two books he
wrote, one published in 1995 and 2000, years after everybody
involved was dead. My own sense is this is boardering on apocrophy, it
is embellished. There are lots of diaries of Marylin, I have read
hundreds of them. It is probably very embroidered. The second point,
the film is very, very polite to both of the principals, even in
Colin Clark's books, he has a bitchy side, he allows both of them
were monstrous, which this film don't. It want them both to be
really nice people. It has a Sunday night television quality, the way
it is shot, everything is order, the darkness about Monroe doesn't
come through. And Olivier. Colin Clark is played almost like, it is
a very gentle, very, it is vaguely charming. It is a biopicture, it
isn't the whole of Marilyn Monroe's life, it takes a week. And we learn
more about her from that week? of course, he, the Eddie Redmayne,
and he's very good a cross between Mia Farrow and Andy Murray, he just
looms and is adorable. The film is interesting, and you mentioned this
with Olivier and Monroe, it does capture a moment where celebrity
changes and actors are passed on and stars are becoming, the film is
a passing of the torch. Olivier knows his time is gone, and the
acting he does is on the way out and the acting Monroe does is there.
He goes to the Royal Court and sucks out all the new Osbourne
stuff. It is It is a turning point for Olivier it is the stage and a
new wave of theatre. Ultimately the take on both of them is fairly
superficial, the more you know about Marylin, there is more
interesting things, even in the filming of The Prince and the
Showgirl, Olivier said terrible things about her from the beginning,
before all of that, he was rude to her before. Many of the things in
the film could have been told 40 years a there doesn't seem to be
any use of our hindsight. It is not a new take. It was about the part
of in his downfall. It was very important to Colin Clark, it wasn't
important historically, and I don't suppose Marilyn remembered it at
all, it was a couple of weeks. claims she called him just before
she died. Using this as a small kernal, it was tamely written. It
could have been an episode of Downton Abbey. Same casting. Green
light casting. Marilyn Monroe did pay the ultimate price for fame
with her famous and untimely death from an overdose. To what limits
will people go to cling to fame and power. That is a question supposed
by Charlie Brooker's new drama, The National Anthem. Script writer,
comlumist and author Charlie Brooker, is renowned for his
commentry on contemporary culture. With 400,000 followers on Twitter,
it is no surprise the social media revolution has inspired his latest
TV series. Black Mirror is his take on the Twilight Zone, the American
1950s sci fi drama, which reflected fears about nuclear war and the
McCarthy era. So, what are the contemporary British issues which
Brooker wants to explore? I was thinking about the relationship
between rolling news and things like Twitter, you get these waves
of opinion and information, rolling in at you. It is sort of too much
to take. Often many days you wake up and think the news has gone
surreal today. It feels like nobody is really in charge. The first of
three films, The National Anthem covers the hours following the
kidnap of a member of the Royal Family. Please don't kill me.
Prime Minister is responsible for securing the Princess's release,
but the hostage takers make a rather unorthodox randsom demand.
The PM, Michael Callow, played by Rory Kinnear, is forced to question
how far he will go for Queen and country. Saving the Princess's
bacon would prove his loyalty, but also cause widespread revulsion.
The sensational news story spreads rapidly around the country. Forcing
traditional media to defy Number Ten's attempts to keep it secret.
Technology is a thread running through all three Black Mirror
films, and Brooker isam belief lent about our current obsession with it.
The first thing I do when I wake up is grab a smart phone and start
checking Twitter and e mail and things like that. Everyone can feel
their brain is being rewired in some way. I'm for technology, I'm
worried about what it is doing to us, it is a destrubgt jif and de  
destrubgtive relationship. It is described as a twisted parable for
the Twitter age. What does it say about how the media shape the news
and how we consume it. What now, what is the play book. This is
virgin territory, there is no play book.
This could be done slapstick and purely for laughs, it isn't like
that? It is fantastic. I thought it was an amazing piece of sat tie, it
is black and bleak, and it is very    satire, it is black and bleak
and very worrying, it is impecably cast, every actor in it is
completely right and good. The timing is so good, the director has
done such a good job. It looks amazing, it is quite shocking. It
is what satire should be. There is a fantastic twist at the end. Not a
twist, it is not fantastic, it is good. Rory Kinnear, is such a
talented actor. He plays the Prime Minister, his wife is well cast. It
is very funny. You laugh in spite of yourself. Were you as
captivated? No, I feel like you are decribing a different film from the
one I saw. I agree it is very dark, I didn't think it was remotely
funny. I didn't laugh for a second. You didn't laugh at the first sight
of the person? No I didn't. The thing for me is a satire, it is
called a twisted parable, it needs to be funny, it needs to be like
The Thick Of It, it begs comparisons there, or needed to be
more twisted. The quote there where he says it is virgin territory and
there is no play book, I thought I have seen this a lot of times
before. They have pushed it, I don't want to ruin it. But they
have just gone further than most people are willing to go. That is
not actually to me making it fun or more meaningful. The twist at the
end, you say, it is a twist at the beginning, you are avoiding the
twist at the beginning because you are not going there at all, you are
holding off that to deliver that to the fresh audience. It is a very
difficult one. It is not something you want to discuss but you don't
want to spoil the splot. It is as if David Cameron is having to have
sex with a pig to save Kate Middleton what ultimately turns out
to be bleepbleep. It is the blackmail threat. It is a plot to
engage with this kind of thing. Possibly the programme that will
save Channel 4 next year on the 30th anniversary, at last some
intelligent life, a response to where we are, and what is happening
to it, from someone aware of it. Charlie Brooker is very good on
this world. Even he can make one of the funnyiest lives in it, "it is
trending on Twitter", or "it is someone she knows from Downton
Abbey", it is something happening lately. It is reality itself
changing, and an attempt to respond to that. How the traditional media
has been caught out by the Internet, the news spreads. You were mention
about The Thick Of It, I was thinking about Day Today and Brass
End, news was God, they are talking about the mainstream media held to
randsom by Twitter and all that, now everyone is chasing after
things. In that sense, the other thing interesting about it, I think
it is basically a one line programme run to an hour. But it is
a comedy that has been directed as a political thriller, in that sense,
because the acting is so overthe top, and hamy, if you want to put
it    over the top, and hamy and over the top. What that girl does
at the beginning is one of the hardest things an act stress can do.
Unlike a lot of political satires like this, where the Prime Minister
would be a two dimensional stoodge, we are sympathetic for him and the
might. At the end, the resolution with his wife is very unpredictable.
The whole thing is. It is beautifully acted. There are people
doing things in this that they are not doing in the Shakespeare.
view it as a drama. But that to me is what kills the joke. On the
contrary, they play it straight, that is funny. It would be if the
lines were funny. The problem is. It is trending on twiter, that is a
brilliant thing. I think that Charlie Brooker is an incredible
writer and I was looking forward to it. What struck me about it n the
week of the Leveson Inquiry, was the public attitude towards what
was happening and how gripped they were. And how complicit they are in
this, which is something we have seen. 140 characters changes a
Government. But also I think part of that is this is the relationship
that Black Mirror deals with in way that My Week With Marilyn doesn't.
It is a two way relationship, the public can respond to things, and
have a view, and what is interesting in fact in Black Mirror
is the Prime Minister is constantly being told about on line polling.
His decision making is having to be done based on on line polling. That
is a more reactive world than my week. Definitely tackling a world
where the control seems to be in the hands of ordinary people, but
in fact they have been given the illusion of control but it is all
taken away from them. What is interesting with Black Mirror, is
although the narrative is that Twitter, it is trending on there,
the blackmailer wants the event to be broadcast on TV. There is still
a sense that actually TV does matter. That tension between the
mainstream media and the Internet world hasn't been resolved. It is
that tension between media and celebrity and what people will do
for power. That goes back to what we were saying about Marylin too?
One of the things, one of the strix that film misses about celebrity
and Marylin's relationship to celebrity, is fame was the great
achievement of her life and the proof of her value. When we talk
about the way the crowd can control these sorts of discourses, it is an
illusion. In part, because so many are chasing fame themselves. Talk
to young people today and so many say their goal is to be famous.
irony of all irony is the Leveson Inquiry is said to be hijacked by
celebrity. The father of one of the 7/7 victims won't appear in front
of it because he fears that. Charlie Brooker says in his
interview, to respond to a piece of satire or a response to it when the
thing itself is becoming more and more surreal. I was watching the
DVD in Black Mirror and behind was the Iveson, the two things were
merging together, to give a hint. Never has Hugh Grant been more Hugh
Grant like. And Hugh Grant for Prime Minister, was on Twitter.
has already played that. To have something that is engaging with
dislocation and dissolving of reality is very refreshing. It is
very difficult to do. And everyone is very scared of it. It seems to
be spoiling the party. You will all get a chance to see Black Mirror if
you want on Channel 4 on the 4th of December. Fame beyond the grave was
guaranteed in Ancient Egypt by the most elaborate funeral arrangements
in his treatment most of it is on show on the first ever public
museum, the Ashmolean in Oxford. It was rebuilt some years ago, a
series of Egyptian galleries will be open to the public, showcaseing
one of the finest archaeological exhibitions in the world.
Amassed over 300 years, the Ashmolean collection of Nile Valley
art facts reflects the long standing British passion for
Egyptling to. Now six new galleries showcase mummies, coffins, shrines
and statues, many of which have been hidden away in store for years.
The result is a journey tracing 3,000 years of culture in Egypt and
Nubia, now Sudan. Featuring some remarkable pieces. This is the
shrine of the king who ruled in the 25th dinnasty. Excavated in Sudan.
It was sound by the first professor of Egyptology, who packed the
shrine away into 150 creates and transported it back to dk cats and
transported it back to    crates and transported it back to the
university. This is one of the most iconic piece, the Princess fresco,
excavated in the 1890, and an intimate portrayal of the Royal
Family, lounging at a palace, including two of the six daughters
of the king and his Queen Nefertiti. Behind me were r two huge statues
of the fertility God, they were excavated in 183, we have
reconstructed them at their original heat.
Display cases protect items carefully restored. Modern medical
technology has revealed more about some objects in the collection than
had ever been known before. Complimenting the ancient exhibits
is a new installation, by the artist, Angela Palmer, based on CT
scans of a two year old boy mummy, died at the end of the Egyptian
century. There is contemporary art to allow the public to peer below
the bandages. The new galleries show case one of the greatest arbg
facts of the period outside of Egypt. How does it help our
understanding of this ancient civilisation.
You enter these new galleries through what was once the shop,
into what was probably the most unusual part of the exhibition, the
predynastic work, we are not familiar with that? I loved this
exhibition. When you see Egypt you see the blockbuster, the pyramids.
They were doing the narrative story, the beginning, the connections
between 3,000 years of history, the thing I most loved about it was it
was telling you the human story, underneath the civilisation. You
keep talking about things like, Egyptian civilisation, pyramids,
kings. What was really important the small items about the human
stories, the clump of human hair, things that people were buried with.
Suddenly you are not talking about civilisations, or thousands of
people, it is individuals. I found it incredibly powerful. The things
they buried with was their every day life, everything they would
need for the next life. wonderful boat carved with 14
different characters doing different things to take them to
the rest world. Jewellery, various things, it was just gorgeous. A
lovely exhibition. There was a particular piece of jul jewellery I
love, a naked woman holding a little bowl. With a ceramic spoon.
A spoon for make up. Exploring back to the predynastic period, pieces
of art that looks abstract. Completely contemporary. I find
when you go to these exhibitions, as much as you are looking into the
past you are looking into the future. An extraordinary sense of
how they were making works of art, how they were decribing their
feelings, how they were preerpbg for death. Is so un   preparing for
death. It is so modern. It is an extraordinary amount of information
to fill in what are inextra ordinary gaps in knowledge. Because
the gallery is filled with intimate moments and takes you through the 6
though words in such an intelligent way, you don't feel overwhelmed and
you piece together the information. Little laund royalists and sick
notes written on    loyal sick notes written on    little sick
notes written on there. And the idea of knowledge, you could take
three or four hours to digest T the first room is a bit deceptive, it
is empty, and there are two big statues, it gets more and more
intense, and the displays get more filled. You could spend hours. It
is wonderful, one of the things I loved about it, we haven't
mentioned it. They have done architectural renovations to create
parallel spaces, so you can see, as Egypt is evolving, Nubia, or Sudan
is evolving simultaneously. They used space to move through time so,
you can look across the room and see this is the Sudan at the same
time, this is what they are doing. You start to get the sense of the
cultural interchange between them. There is a wonderful piece that
they had, I loved this, it was a script, they haven't desieveered it
yet, they said there    desieveered this yet, they said there were
scolars working on it as you saw T The fact you see how the    the
fact you saw how the Egyptians influenced the rest of the world. A
roam boy mummified. And a Roman woman painted on her, she is
mummified but this Roman thing on it. She has the criss cross
bandaging with the goldam mulets. The fact that it was in the Roman
empire and it carried on. For the first time in that exhibition I got
that sense there is Egypt in us now in England. A lot of that is
traditional museum curating they have done, I liked they had the
guts not to reinvent everything. Not modernising it, they don't do
tweets! There are modern touches, the interactive computer to see the
CSI, CD video of the thing. Angela Palmer, it plaiks you feel at the
end of the exhibition how shocking and sudden and beautiful things
were at that time. The colours are still preserved, buetloofl
terracottas and blues.    beautiful terracottas and blues. How did they
deal with the idea these are human remains? They do it really well and
intelligently. One of the women the mummies they have, had an
inscription that was meant to be read out as a memorial. They are
encouraging visitors to read it out. That is the ritual she wanted
people to be participating in. She wanted to be preserved, they have
put her in state of the art preservation, she is lasting longer
than she expected. The fact they are portraits, you can see the
faces of the woman and man, not just the bound things. I thought
they were really people, for the first time I thought. It is a
constant theme that has gone on ever since that death is the team
of life. You recreate your life in the next life. Something in Egypt
that they really went to town in terms of preparing for the
afterlife. In terms of just the amount of servants and these mini 
bakeries. They create the immortality, we are still looking
at those things. They were right. The immortality exists. It is like
Marilyn Monroe. Was she a mummy. She had one but wasn't very nice to
her. Like Marylin, Kerouac is another of those single words that
carry a whole host of associations, Jack Kerouac also died in the 1960s,
his profile, too, like Marilyn Monroe, has never faded. Next year
we will see a film version of his best known work, On The Road. And
this week, Kerouac's long lost first novel is finally published.
Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel, On The Road, has axe fired cult stages as
its pages incaps late the literary movement that Kerouac dubbed The
Beatles. People ask why I    Beat Generation. People ask why I
wrote these books, I wrote what was true and what I saw. Before he took
to the road he took to the sea. In 1942 having dropped out of Colombia
University, Kerouac completed his first tour in the United States
Merchant Marine, the trip fed his love for adventure, and inspired
him to keep a journal, detailing the daily routine of life at sea,
and the characters of his fellow shipmates. These journal entries
forpbl the basis of his first novel. The Sea Is My Brother hasn't been
published in its entirety until now. The only reference to his existence
lay in Kerouac's private letters. It centres on two men, both of whom
share characteristics with the author. One leaves his teaching job
at Colombia, following his new friend, the ruthless drifter,
Wesley Martin, a man who Kerouac said loved the sea with a strange
lonely love. The sea is his brother, and sentences he goes down. He felt
the thrill of anticipation as he sat there dosing, in a few days,
back on a ship, the sleeply thrum of the propeller chuorning in the
water below, the soothing rise and fall of the ship. The sea
stretching around the horizon, the rich, clean sound of the bow
spliting water, and the long hours lounging on deck in the sun,
watching the deck of clouds, ravished by the full, moist breeze.
A simple life, a serious life. To make the sea your own, to watch
over it, to brood your very soul into it, to accept it and love it
as though only it mattered and existed. The book also contains an
assortment of other early writings from the same period, as well as
letters, sketches and photographs. Is The Sea Is My Brother a valuable
record of an author's early efforts, are was is juvenile book,
previously unpublished, for a good reason.
Did they book deserve to be unearthed? Absolutely, anything
that gives a clue of how a great mind was forming. Jack Kerouac has
become more a personality, a great American personality. Anything that
can remind us he was a great American writer as well is very
important. As a brand he gets underestimated as an American
writer. I love him as an American writer, I love seeing this happen,
in the 1940s you see a young boy, influenced and wants to be a great
novelist by all the great writers, but also at the same time, at that
moment by Charley Parker and Leicester Young, it is merging
together and you are seeing it ferment and bubble. The sentences
gets longer during the 1920s and 1930, you see a forming of the mind
that remind you that above all EMS he was a great American writer not
just a    else he was a great American writer. What did you
think? It is embryonic. The problem is, he wants to be a great writer,
but like so many aspiring young writers, he has absolutely nothing
to say. Here there is nothing to say here. It is derivative at best.
It is a sketch, really. It wasn't published for ran. Kerouac himself,
before he died, referred to this novel as a croc. I think we can
trust the man's assessment here. At best at flimcy. There is some
really bad writing. He does that thing that bad writing 101, won't
use the word "said", you runs through other words, he greeted
hello, she yawned and then says something, she mild hello. 'S only
20 years ol. It is not complete this book, it    he's only 20 years
old. It is not complete this week, it is like an early demo for a band.
I never got into Kerouac, I preferred Steinbeck in terms of
road movies and novels. I want to say that what is interesting about
it is just the fact that he does have this tension between being an
intellectual and the physical world. He has that and follows it through.
Everheart is an academic builty about being an axe dij. In the
sense of    academic, in a sense of seeing that grow is interesting.
had to staple this book to me I found isth almost unreadable. It is
so hard to read, so endlessly macho. And cold beers, and people who
punch each other in the stomach as a form of greeting, and kick each
other up the pants. So American, and misolg sojist.
I thought the ambition, the care, the idealism, the belief in
something, a lot of things that have gone missing, I saw all of
that. Especially with the novel in itself ending with the ship sailing
off and it ends there. When the ship is sailing off and what is
happening is it is taking high culture with it, he's handing that
over to popular culture. That is giving it a lot of credit. I only
went to see say for a year. You are delivering a lot of intelligence.
It did change popular culture, you see what happened in that period
end earth Dylan and The Beatles. It makes it an interesting book. It
makes it a book worth publishing. The journal is interesting, the
Journal of the Egoist, he's a having that conversation about what
kind of write he wants to be. He wants to go an eccentric artist and
he wants to do those things. There is something endearing about T
is an important manifesto. I don't agree, any creative writing teacher
has read this over and again. The fact he went on 15 years later on a
drug drag to write one good book. The rest of what he wrote is not
good. It does feel like when you are a teenager at school and you
want to use the word "picturesque" as often as you can. There is
poignancy there. We know what happens, he does and doesn't become.
Why do you think the Kerouac phenomenon has survived y is it
people want to publish this, and not just the first novel but his
letters, his friends, his poetry. His awful peoples. He became a
brand    The poems? He became a brand name, who became famous,
beginning as a 20 year old talking about famous authors. People who
like Kerouac don't read the novels but like the idea of him. I thought
it strange to condemn the aspiration happening in a 20 year 
old, willing it to lap, and then was part of such an important
movement to say it should be obliterated. I said it is not good,
I didn't say obliterated. I just said it is not good. But in
what sense? Part of the guy that became the brand name that creates
curiosity, this is who he was as a 20 year old. You are never going to
agree on that one. If a stranger accosts you in the street with a
copy of a book, Maureen would be upset if it was Kerouac. It was The
Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie, not a literary mugging but an act of
generosity, something similar is happening this year, this is how to
prepare yourself. This March saw the launch of World Book Night, a
new event across Britain and Ireland, which aimed to celebrate
the pleasure of reading. A million special low printed books were
given out to members of the public, to pass on to friends, family, or
complete strangers. World Book Night was the brain child of
publisher Jamie Bing. One million books, a hell of a lot of books,
It was the biggest book give away ever, people responded
enthusiastically? Reading is the most important thing in my life. I
can't think of anything more important to me. It has shaped my
outlook on life, it has opened up a lot of safes, tradition, cultures.
Most of what I know is through reading. The World Book Night
committee recently announced the list of 25 books to be given away
at next year's event, which will take part on Shakespeare's birthday,
April 23rd. Classics like Pride and Prejudice, to Steven King's
psychological misery, and contemporary best sellers, like The
Road. You have until the end of December
to register. Visit the World Book Night for more details.

have discussed tonight are on the web side. Next week Kirsty will be
here with a book special, featuring new titles from Alice Marilyn
Monroe, and others. Stay tuned for later for Jools and his guests.
Thanks to my guests, Maureen, Paul, Sarah and Salfraz. We leave you
tonight with the television debut of Glasgow based music, Peter Kelly,
Feather Trail, this is him. Marry young
For the need to be alone fl Sort of swung
And fear of ringing telephones Into a wall
Who has learned to crow The winner is the last of all
Carried like soap To the one welcoming cave
Words stick in your throat To a fold
The winter is a first of all Tired like courage
We're losing to an undead past Tired is courage
By the act Choosing the booze don't path
No need for glory Put to song
But undone Brownen like glass
Into the sun Into the cold
And shadow meeting with the world The window is the mover's pole
Tired like courage To the mast
But losing to an undead past Tide discouraged
By the act    tired discouraged By the act
Choosing the booze Don't act
Wake your heart up It's dying to trying
Hey wake your heart up It's dying to start trying
Tired like courage To the mast
But losing to an undead past Tired discouraged
By the act Choosing the bruise don't pass
Hey wake your heart up It's dying to start to try
