Good morning. Get ready for a once in a lifetime masterclass! This is
a very special, Saturday Kitchen Live! Welcome to the show. Cooking
with me live this morning are two of the greatest chefs in the world.
First, the man who inspired a British restaurant revolution, 44
years ago when he opened the Le Gavroche and later The Waterside
Inn. With his brother, Albert. It is Michel Albert. Do you like this?
I like it. I really think you have come out of your way today. With
him, the man at The Waterside Inn, whose job it is to retain the
highly priced three Michelin stars, he is making his dad proud so far,
making his debut on Saturday Kitchen, it is Alain Roux. First
time on Saturday Kitchen ever? First time. Alain, what is on the
menu? Today, I was going to do a desert, but it is a savoury dish,
it is a Warm timbales of scallop. Sounds good to me. Seasonal with
the asparagus? Seasonal, cheap as well on the market. Apart from the
cheap scallops! And Michelin? Cehrry meringues with rhubarb sauce.
I love the rhubarb. It is with a coulis. It keeps it light. Cherries
are just about to come into the season? Just about. So, two great
dishes to look forward to. We have a great foodie line up of films
from the BBC archives. Now, today's guest. He is normally desed like
this? I never dress like that in my life. He is in charge of the
toughest quiz on air, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. You look like my
dentist! What kind of dentist do you go to sha? Do you like it?
is like talking to Noddy. Thank you very much. Any way, you are here
for food heaven and food hell? like your food? I love my grub. I
love my grub. So, the next stage of the programme, food heaven or food
hell of the something based on your favourite grons. Our guests and
chefingst    chefs will be helping to decide what you eat at the end
of the show? So. So, what will it be? Meat. I love it I'm a real
carnivore. I love it. I love it Food hell? Well, I don't do desert.
I hate desert. Even school. I hated all of those disgusting things. The
other thing you mentioned. The you mentioned it, the only thing I
really hate apart from deserts is rhubarb. So why am I here? Talking
to a man dressed as Noddy. I have something a little different, a
lamb salad. First I have little gem, mizuna, carrots, beansprouts and
herbs. It's dressed with lime juice, ginger, peanuts and chilli,
finished with crispy shredded lamb on top. Or Chris could be facing
food hell, that delicious, wonderful, fantastic, rich cock
late pudding. That is the stuff they gave us at school. This one,
the chocolate is melted with butter, eggs sugar, mixed with flour. Baked.
Served warm with caramelised bananas, and creme anglais. With a
scoop of banana ice cream. You have to wait until the end of the show
to see which one Chris gets. Are you happy with that? No! Now, the
other Saturday Kitchen guests, Louise, who have you brought with
you? I have to sie my best friend! Apologies to all of the other best
friends! This is Dawn. You are a fan of allotments? It is my dad's
allotment and I have gone up to pitch in and help. I really enjoy
it. Which of you two is a meringue maker? Me. I love meringues. So, we
will talk with you a little bit later. You will help to decide what
Chris is eating at the end of the show. If you would like to call us,
call the number here: If you get on the show we are asking if Chris
should be getting food heaven or food hell. I have a nasty feeling
about this. Start thinking. It is getting your own back! Now, our
masterclass, starting off with the man making his debut on.the show.
It is the three Michelin starred, Alain Roux! Great to have you on
the show. What are you cooking for us, then? It is a Warm timbales of
scallop. It is with scallops, fresh herbs and asparagus. You want me to
get on and butter the dishes? get on and butter the dishes?
you can. I'm going to start by doing the mousse. I have the fresh
scallops that have been opened, cleaned. They have been obviously
taken very fresh. They have not so much water in them. I am adding the
eggs and going to whizz. Cles mentioned school, but how was
school for you?    Chris mentioned school, but how was school for you?
When did you interest lie in food? Did you learn it from your father
or did it come out later on? I think that it helps to have a
father like I have. He was really into food. Dad used to cook nowed a
again at home. It does help. Now we are getting to the truth! I am
adding a pinch of cayenne pepper there and a little salt as well.
Some double cream. So, how many king scallops in
there? There are about five. You could go up to six, seven or eight
if they are really small. That is going to whizz for another minute.
Yep. That is just cayenne pepper in there? Yes. You could use a white
or black pepper if you don't fancy the spiciness of the pepper, of the
cayenne, but we think it does give a bit of kick to it.
Now in terms of your formal training when did that start?
started only five years ago. I was 16! Yes! No, I started about 16
years old. It was in the pastry shop doing
classical deserts and pastry in Paris in the 7tharondissment. That
was a great time. I did it for two years and after that I moved into
cooking in the restaurants. The rest, as they say, it is
history. You took over at The Waterside Inn.
I joined nearly two years ago. In the last two years dad stopped
cooking. I had to stop cooking. That is when it became more serious
for me. It is a big, big place to fill,
that place? It is, but it is not as much of a threat as being here! I
have to say, I am really pleased to be here.
I am not only a friend of yours, but you are a great chef. My dream
was to become a legion air. I think that I have more chance with Chris!
So here we are. So, what are the herbs in here? I
have buttered the moulds? We have these nicely buttered. I have
tarragon, parsley. You could use just one herb it could be dill or
chives. I know where you were this morning before we came, you were
snipping the fresh hers in the garden.
It is true we have a fresh herb garden, that is great.
And you are going to tip these out later? Yes. It must be pressed on
the sides, on the bottom. We put the mix in there.
Add in the mix in there. That's the mousse.
Now, I'm going to fill up the roasting traifplt
I'll cover them up for you    fill up the roasting tray.
Why the paper? That is to help with the cooking. It eases the cooking.
It gives a little bit of water at the bottom of the moulds.
In the oven? Yep, that goes into the oven. How long do you cook
those for? They cook for about 20, 25 minutes.
I'll move on, I know we have to get the sauce on? Yes.
Your asparagus is cooked there. For somebody who has never,
permanently been brought up in England, you have the French
accent? The school has been French throughout my youth.
My dad's English is not brilliant so... Sorry! Still room for
improvement! Yes. Right, so explain the sauce for
this, then? The sauce is basically, I'm doing the garnish as well as
the sauce at the same time. I'm adding the asparagus and I have the
pan here which is with the butter. I'm going to melt that down and
foam it. While you get that in, if you would
like to ask us question at the end of the show, the number is:
You can put your questions to us live later on. The recipes with all
of the other recipes on the show is We are basically going to cook the
asparagus until it is tender. We have the asparagus that needs to be
crunchy. Slightly tender, you can check it
with the fingers or a small knife. For anybody who has not been to
Bray, it is like a little gastronomicvillage? Yes, it,    it
is, obviously with Heston. It is a great place to go.
You have a unique place, your place is right on the river? It is true,
the setting is unique. To spend the afternoon is really a love lir
thing to do. And you have a new kitchen?   
have a lovely place to sit by the river. It is a lovely thing to do.
And a new kitchen? Yes, it was a three year project. It has been two
years old now. It is working beautifully now.
I have half of the asparagus. To garnish. The other is in the pan. I
will add some wine, double cream and a little lemon.
Once the timer is off, is there a way of checking these? The best
thing is to use a small knife or a secure. So the secure is here. We
just put it in the middle for about eight, ten seconds and it should be
clean and warm. So, they are just about there.
The reason to put it on the lip is to check the heat? Yes, it needs to
be hot. Otherwise it is not cooked. It is a shame it is not very hot,
it would burn your lips! You are a very caring father, aren't you?
It's always been like that! wait your turn for the meringues!
should remember that! The scallops, you are grilling them nicely. We
are doing a nice countries cross on both sides. That is for the
presentation side. It depends on how you like your scallops to be
cooked. If you like them moist or prefer them to be on the safe side
and eat them... Oops! Well, those things happen. I've been pressing
obviously too hard. Those asparagus should go in there.
Your dad will have to buy me a new sieve now. All that money you spent
on the kitchen. I have all new equipment at home.
Right, we have the scallops, I shall lift these off and we are
ready to plate. So, the sauce needs to be checked
on the seasoning. I have enough lemon in there. It needs a little
salt. What we do is obviously we use a
small knife which was here... you go.
Thank you. Just to ease the little dish. The mousse, otherwise,
sometimes it tends to stick. So this is super, super delicate.
A very delicate dish. It is always nicer to have it that way. Not too
bad. It takes a long time, but it is not too bad, but anything that
is good takes time. We know that Exactly.
The asparagus on. It is great it is bang in season
now. And so is the cherry meringue.
Yes. And the scallops on top.
So remind us what that is again? is a Warm timbales of scallop, with
fresh herbs and asparagus. There you are.
There you go. The boy did well! Dive into this.
Yummy. Yummy. Tell us what you think. Lovely and
light. It is a really nice texture. Just
like my baby's bum! Is it hard cooking in front of your dad? Is
that difficult. No. No. No. It is difficult to cook
in front of James and with James. In the meantime we need wine to go
with this. We sent our wine expert Olly Smith to Derby sher   
Olly Smith to Derby sher    Derbyshire.
Today it is all about Ashbourne. What a great place to head out and
look for wine for this week's Alain's sensational scallop mousse
with ar par gus has a wealth of tastes and textures, but the
headline is creaminess. Where the whoit wine is concerned that could
only mean white burgundy. There is this outstanding wine, well worth
splashing out on, however... You can still find decent white
burgundy for under a tenner. Like this one. It is Louis Latour Macon 
Lugny. This wine comes from the rolling
limestone hills of the Macone, near Lyon. The history of this stretches
way back over 1600 years to the Romans. This may come from an
ancient place, but it smells as fresh as a daisy. It is crisp. That
is what I'm after to match up with the salty flavour of the scallops
and the zing of the lemon in the dish. There is also oak in the wine.
That fleshs out the texture, enriching it and giving complexity.
That is what you need when matching a wine with cream and butter.
Finally, punch. Vibe rans. This wine has all of that. That is what
I'm after to pair up with the herb flavours in the dish, the parsley,
the tarragon and the unique pungence of the ar par gus.
Alain,    asparagus. Alain, cheers! Enjoying it over there? What do you
reckon to the wine? I think it is great. A lovely white wine.
A good match? I think it is beautiful.
It is a bit of a bargain? What do you think, Chris? Happy with that?
I don't normally drink after after 10.00am, good Lord, is that the
time! Louise? Lovely. Michel,ior son's first live
appearance?    your son's first live appearance? I think he has
done wonderful. He has done perfectly well.
The wine chosen is great. Just sharp, nice. A perfect dish.
Later on we get a lesson in making word class deserts from the man
over there, Roux Senior. What are you making again? Oh, it is me! It
is cherry meringue with rhubarb coulis. First, we head off to the
Mediterranean with Rick Stein. He is in Corfu, heading to the hills
for lunch. He must be hungry, there is not even time to visit the local
I'm off to have lunch with this Carlis family. They have lived leer
for eight generations. Here they grow their own food. Eln
is making a common dish all over Greece, but here it is the best.
Sometimes it is made with bread, but it is more commonly made with
potato, olive oil, garlic and lemon After crushing about a dozen fat
and then, straightaway she adds the garlic paste.
This is for people who like to live on the edge, where food's concerned!
Anyway, she blends that together and adds olive oil
and this comes from the ripe black olives from their farm.
After that she adds lemon juice and that's it.
This is a really good example of a local dish.
It's all from their garden   lemons, potatoes, garlic and the oil.
I've been watching her make this and with growing sense of appetite,
because I love things like this. I'll just taste it.
Wow!
That is so hot with garlic.
Unbelievably hot.
Absolutely pungent with lemon and oil, it's really, really...
Very good!
Papa Spiros, who is 82, has just retired as a local priest.
He puts his obvious sprightliness down to clean living  
not much meat, lots of fish and vegetables plus red wine and garlic.
Well, as usual, on this trip I felt at a bit of a loss because I couldn't speak the language,
but Papa Spiros's son, Perry, used to run a pub in England.
To my way of thinking, your dad is a walking example
of why Mediterranean food's wonderfully good for you.
How old is he now? 82.
82? He looks as fit as a fiddle.
Still climbing up the trees.
Every day he's doing something on the little farm we've got. Really?
Ploughing potatoes or vegetables and stuff like that.
If you wanted to encapsulate why Mediterranean food is so special,
just show a picture of your father.  That's right.
I'd like to propose a toast to Greek hospitality,
very much in evidence today.
Yamas.

Is The thing
Is The thing that I like about acre few is all the different people
that have lived here, that is no different to the dish, pastitsio.
It is a lovely mix of Greek and Italian.
But look here, there is this lovely boulevard and there is a lot of
British here. They brought in the ginger beer and cricket.
I pensioned    mentioned pastitsio. To start with,
This is garlic, onion and finely chopped celery
softened in olive oil
and then some minced beef which has to brown a bit
before you add a glass of red wine and a tin of chopped tomatoes.
And then a couple of dessert spoonfuls of tomato puree,
I really like this pastitsio, it's got the unique flavours
for a typical pasta and mince dish
of cinnamon Kefalotiri cheese.
I just think Greek cooking is sort of very underrated.
This is lovely, hearty food, it's like a Greek version
of a shepherd's pie, or actually a cottage pie,
because it's beef, not lamb.
But it's just those little subtle flavours
and I think we do the Greeks a big disservice going on holiday there
and just having tepid vegetable dishes,
because this is pretty stylish stuff.
Stylish enough to add a cinnamon stick and a little bit of ground cloves.
I forgot to mention oregano in addition to the cinnamon.
Very characteristic flavouring in lots of Greek cooking.
Sometimes they sprinkle it on Greek salad and often you get it on souvlakis as well.
And when you're walking through the Greek countryside, maybe on an island somewhere, you can smell it.
Tips on white sauce making   some people feel you should put hot milk into a cool sauce.

I have tipped some milk into the I feel you should put cool milk
otherwise there's a danger of it splitting.
Once it's there, and with a consistency like fairly thick cream,
grate some fresh nutmeg into it and then season it too.
Now take the cooked pasta and mix it into a third of your white sauce,
making sure you get most of it in the bowl and not on the kitchen floor, just enough to coat it.
Then in with the grated cheese.
That lovely Kefalotiri cheese
which will have such a distinctive flavour in the finished dish.
Mix well and pop in a couple of beaten eggs for extra richness.
Now layer it in a buttered baking dish.
It's really like making a lasagne as you alternate the pasta with the meat sauce.
Finish with pasta on the top and pour over the rest of the white sauce.
What I like about this dish, you can serve it up for ten people or so
who want to seriously chat over a meal, including you,
so that you don't have to keep getting up and down cos it's all done beforehand.
You can all help yourself and maybe just a salad to go with it and some red wine.
Lastly, sprinkle with that salty, tangy kefalotiri, which incidentally
is a hard sheep's milk cheese, and bake in a hot oven for 40 minutes
until it gets a lovely golden top.
Pastitsio is the Greek version of the Italian pasticcio,
which means a hotchpotch, grabbing a bit here and a bit there.
And you can see it is like a lasagne, layers of pasta, meat sauce
and bechamel, but it's something the Greeks have made all their own.

That pastitsio looked delicious.
That pastitsio looked delicious. As I have said before, the idea of
serving a big dish like that to    that for a dinner party, it is
fantastic. I did a shoulder of pork the other day, but this is a disert
that you can do    desert that you can do in exactly the same way.
You keep saying that! Right, what I'm going to do, this is a nice,
simple desert. You need to make puff pastry. I make my own, this is
rough puff pastry. That is not easy to say.
. The difference is how you add the butter.
You love butter. I love butter. I love it because I
think it is good. You will come back in another life
as a pat of butter. as a pat of butter.
I alright am, mate! Now, we roll this out.
We take our tray and we bake this. So we bake it inbetween two trays.
So I leave that to rest in the fridge. Prick it well with the fork.
Put the tray on the top. Bake it. Why between the tray? Because you
want to get it nice and thin. In the meantime, I want the flavour
of the puff pastry, but I want it nice and thin.
Now, I was reading a brief about you, I did not realise you were a
teacher originally? Yes, I taught for 12 months in the East End of
London to 14 year olds. What did you teach? Not a lot. They wanted
to leave badly, but it was a learveing curve. Good fun.
A big learn curve, you did not like it that much? No. I left. I think
if it had been a twee school. In Dorset or somewhere, I would have
enjoyed it. It was depressing. The kids didn't want to learn. It was a
tough environment for them. I was reading the fact that you
wanted to abTV presenter, you wanted to get it really badly. You
wrote hundreds of letters in long  hand? Yes, I did. It was things
like, I remember this dreadful phrase. It was a very, very, me, me
letter. It had a phrase saying,, "I am the face of the 70s, this is
your chance to snap me up." I remember writing that and now
thinking oh, gosh! I got the return saying that they would keep my
letter on file. That meant in the bin, that I was a nutter. ATV sent
for me. They gave me an interview. I think it was just to see what
sort of person could write such a letter, but they gave me a job.
How do get from there to Capital where I remember you from? Yes,
ermorning. I loved it. I had a great time, but it was something
like 17 years of 5am alarm calls. I loved it. I had a great time on
Radio 1. I'm doing Radio 2, but I don't want to go back to daily
radio, but I love it I'm better looking on radio!
watch my mate Mr Evans, you know, the last time we met was on a
television studio? It was. You choose Chris Evans to be your
partner on Celebrity Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. I said why? The
last time he was on with Sir Terry Wogan, they were a disaster. They
went away with �35. But this time you proved us wrong.
He want away with �250! You don't know this, no celebrity on
Millionaire has ever gone away with less than at least �1000, you went
awhich with �250!. Thanks for that, Chris!. You picked the questions!
How did you go from doing that? The producer of the radio show, they
invented? David Brigs, he was the producer on the show. He came up
with a load of for mats for the radio show. One of the ones was a
thing called Double or Quits. It became the germ of Who Wants To Be
A Millionaire. It is now the most successful game show in the history
of the world. It goes out in about 115 countries. It is an amazing for
mat. You are probably that    not that fond of it, but it works
everywhere. In China, South America. How many millionaires have they
dished out? Around the world, I don't know. In the UK there has
been six. Well, five and a crook, basically. So five.
And the coffer! Right I will show you this. If you ever want to make
this, Chris. This is your whipped cream. A bit of vanilla, a creme
anglais or a bit of custard in the cream.
It is low calorie, then, this? Absolutely! Absolutely low calorie!
The stpraub    the strawberry looks like meat! No, it is not! Where is
Zine al Abidine Ben Ali! Zinedin? What are you doing now?
He is smoking it. This is the hot melt l secures that
you heat up. Why are you doing that.
Why? Yeah, what's it doing? I don't know what it is doing it is making
it look pretty for you. Not that you are eating it.
I wonder why you bother taking a good looking dish and then burning
it on the top. Thanks, Chris! So, you are doing
radio next week? Yes, I get my fix. Do you prefer radio to TV or what?
I like them both. They are fun. I do like radio, it is a buzz. Radio
2 are splendid. When I did it for them a year ago. I am used to a
play list. I sent them a list of my hippy tracks, thinking that they
would probably let me play ten of them.
They asked for more, I said I had sent00. It is fantastic. I get my
Floyd albums out. And your huge other passion, the
massive passion is fishing? Yes! Now I have fished since I was
four... What are you doing now? Everybody down! Look out! Nobody
panic. Watch, watch. Easy now.
Come on, I'm nervous enough with the pastry chefs over there.
Marvellous! Very nice. Lovely. Get in there! Get in there my son!
Go on, then, fishing? I started fishing when I was four. I have
fished all over the world. What is this about a turbot? What
is this, you mean a Halley    halibut? Well, it is flat, isn't
it? Are you sure you are a cook? What are you doing now? Come on,
everybody is listening! No, they are not. Somebody asked what is the
biggest fish I have caught. I caught a 200 pound halibut. Not
turbot. It is enormous. It was longer than the boat.
That is amazing. I am making my own candy floss.
It is a little golden weed. It's like the ex presenter of this
show, Antony Worrall Thompson! There you go! Not that you are
going to eat it. Right, what are we cooking for Chris at the end of the
show? It could be lamb. I will use little gem, mizuna, carrots,
beansprouts and herbs. It's dressed with lime juice, ginger, peanuts
and chilli, finished with crispy dreaded food hell. A rich chocolate
pudding. Melted with butter, sugar, eggs, flour. Baked. Served with
caramelised bananas, a little custard creme anglais.
Some of you in the studio get to decide Chris's feat, Alain, what is
it, chocolate or lamb? Chocolate it is my favourite. Louise? Lamb. I
have to go lamb. Right, let's get up to date with the latest action
from Celebrity MasterChef. Lisa Faulkner, Christine Hamilton, Dick
Strawbridge are in France. They have to face a challenge of cooking
in a champagne house for very prestigious diners. Let's see what
Tonight you are the soul caters for a dinner hosted by the tat inger
fame. Among the guests are masters of
food and champagne. The surroundings should give an
indication of how important the dish is, how far you have to
elevate your food to impress. Tonight you have to truly impress.
The chateau was bought in 1934 by his descendants have built
The dishes that our contestants are attempting are chosen by the family.
This is complex French refined food,
well beyond a level they have tried before.
We're going to find out who has the makings of a MasterChef champion.
'The celebrities have three hours to prepare a three course menu
'under the guidance of house chef, Christophe Tivier.
'Christine is making a starter of scallops cooked four ways  
'sauteed, stuffed, sesame encrusted and curried,
'served with a risotto, a tuile and a blini.'
I'm going to be here all night doing these scallops.
I'm not going to let these devils defeat me.
'Dick is cooking the main course, lamb fillet en croute,
'with a sumac spiced crust.
'It will be served with pea gnocchi, tomato petals,
'a pea and chorizo jus and a chorizo stuffed tomato.'
Dick, you bear the bulk of responsibility.
They're used to excellent food. There's a lot of pressure.
'Lisa is in charge of the pudding.
'She's making a pear dessert served four ways.
'Pear and almond tart, pear sorbet in a basket,
'pear and green tea mousse on a sable biscuit,
'and pear macaroon with a cream filling, served with caramel sauce.'
Lisa has dessert and she has a huge amount of work leading up to service
then everything being assembled as a great pastry chef should.
I've got a list as long as my arm of desserts I've got to make.
'With an hour already gone, Christine is prepping her scallops.
'They are cooked just before service and served with a luxurious sauce.'
I've had a lucky break. My menu says white wine but I've got champagne!
I will have to taste it to make sure it really is champagne.
There we go. Brilliant.
'On the other side of the kitchen, Dick's finishing his first task,
'the chorizo stuffed tomatoes.'
You've got the sauce to make and the en croute to make. And the gnocchi.
A lot to go. A lot to do.
'Lisa has 12 elements to make for her dessert.
'The pear and green tea mousse is ready for setting,
'and she's making a start on the almond baskets to go with a sorbet.'
This is one of those things you can't believe you're doing.
You're in control, aren't you?
I'm trying to get everything done, then I'll see if I'm in control.
Just over an hour for the first course.
'Upstairs, final preparations are under way for the guests' arrival.
'Christine is first to serve, and can't run late again.
'She's on track with her risotto,
'but still has to make the blinis and rice biscuit tuiles.'
Rice wafers? How are they? Well, I don't know.
The things that I'm worried about cos I haven't even started yet...
I can't remember what they are, to be honest. Oh, some blinis!
Can you make blinis in 45 minutes?
I haven't got 45 minutes, because that includes my plating up time,
re heating, finishing the sauce, so honestly, I don't know.
'While concentrating on getting the consistency of his pea gnocchi right
'Dick has taken his eye off the chorizo and pea jus,
'which has boiled dry.'
That's not good?
Begin again. Oh, oui.
The first time, it did its own thing.
It looked pretty grim so all I can do is try again.
In trying again, with a bit of luck, it'll...look edible.
'With 45 minutes until service, the guests arrive.
'Among them are some of the Champagne region's finest palates.
You have just 30 minutes before the first course.
'With service looming, Lisa is struggling to stay on top
'of the volume of work.'
I've got to do my tarts.
My biscuits are resting.
I've got to do my macaroon.
I've got so much to do. Right.

And on the menu, a desert? It is cherry meringue.
A masterclass on how to make a proper meringue? You need egg white.
You have to whisk them for a little while with sugar. Caster sugar.
Then a little bit of icing sugar. It is the first time I have seen
icing sugar in this? I don't give up all of my secrets. It gives a
texture and the eyery colour to the meringue to use the icing sugar.

again! I can't see you or hear you! So, here we are. We have done that.
We get rid of the egg yolk. Now, we have the cherries. They are
not in season in the UK yet. No, but in two weeks or a week or
two, there will be plenty and they thereby there for four to six weeks.
They are huge, those cheryisz, I have never seen    those cherries,
I have never seen cherries so big! Do you know how much they are? �2!
�2 each! No, half of that! So, the syrup is on.
You are costing me a lot of money! �2 a cherry! The rhubarb has been,
look at that, the rhubarb, you like that? You know I don't! Right, the
rhubarb? Now, what have you added to the meringue? Only sugar.
There is the syrup. I have the syrup, the bay leaves and the thyme.
It flavours everything. So you have bay leaves and thyme in
there? Yes, the thyme in there is very much depending on how ripe the
cherries is. Don't these go well together, the
herbs and the fruit? Yes, they go very well together.
Can I have a look at the meringue? Now, look at that. That is half of
the sugar. It is there. Now, we add the icing sura. We
return it for a bit Is he doing OK? So far it is good.
Thank you very much. Then I'm cutting the rhubarb into little
chunks. If the rhubarb is bigger than that and tough you peel it,
but we just want a coulis. So this is for the flavour with the sugar
in it, the syrup and we cook it for a few minutes and we are out of the
way. It is a chirpy desert. It is for the children, the grown ups and
the oldies! The oldies? Yes, like Here we are. Look at that
Now, I do the desert, the meringue with prunes as well, sorry, plums
as well when in season. Do you still... Do you want the
vine Allah in there? Yes. Do you still go into the kitchen?
Seldom. I need a pro  passport now. He is banned from the kitchen.
No. I live abroad. I leave him with the shop.
Well, he's doing a very, very good job.
Now the cherries. You want them in a bowl.
Thank you. Well done. These go in the fridge? Yes.
Don't forget the recipes are on the website. Go to: He is chatting away
to himself! The dishs from the previous shows are on the website
too. Here we are.
Are you OK, chef? Yes, I am. That's it. Do you know what is happening
James? He has you, you are very good, but normally he is used to
work with about 20 chefs around him. Not anymore! He is a bit lost, yes
? He is a bit lost? That was not nice! You are doing it contrary to
what everybody is taught, I suppose by adding the sugar carefully in
the end. You just chuck everything in? Yes. Right. Why the icing sugar,
why half and half? Look at the texture. Look at the holding of
that. It is too soft. It is a little too soft! It is not
too soft. You are going to get it in a minute. No, I think it is
perfect, dad. Now, you think it is perfect.
want my meringue! So, we are doing a big spoon like that
Look at that Can you do the sauce. Did you put
the cherries inside? I promises you. They are too expensive to be
forgotten. So, here we are. Why are you going to spoil that
with rhubarb? It is just to pour around it.
When I knew you were coming I decided to use rhubarb everywhere!
He is the same with me! The whole cherries, no need to dice them?
Just like that They look perfect.
A week ago I was in Artica with the dogs.
Yes, tell us about that? We were looking after the dogs, Super
Leaguing, you live with the dogs. They look at you nicely, when you
feed them. If you don't forget to feed them they look at you nicely,
if you forget to feed them, they don't! You get to take them out
every day and it is lovely. Why not take a snowmobile? I like
the animals. It was lovely. Fantastic.
We are to cool that down. I'm trying to be careful not to
break another whisk and a sieve. No. No. The family are not like
that! When you want to cool down a sauce quickly a coulis, should I
say. You put it in a tray for a few minutes. Here you are. Then, the
bowl, thank you. Then the bowl in the ice. In less than a couple of
minutes, it is cold. I'll stir this around.
You do the meringue. I need the rhubarb. Look at that.
They've been oozing out! Look at the syrup. There is bay leaf
sticking out of one! You are jealous! That one is not mine.
Look at the syrup. That is mine. That is not for you, by the way.
This is for the guest eating next to you.
He has done that a few times. And a bit of the coulis.
It can be served separate or around it. It is very light. It is vanilla
flavour. The colour goes beautifully well. You can see that,
it is almost pinkish. Here we R It is a cherry meringue with
rhubarb coulis. He has been on so much, I don't
even need to ask him! Thank you!. Fabulous. There you go. Right,
Chris... You have to try this one. 7 It was fine until you got the
rhubarb out. Pick out the cherry.
The �2 cherry. You do it with prunes? I do it with
prunes in the season and peaches, but you have to poach them lightly
first. Dry them and mix them in the meringue.
Hmm... Hmm... In English that means we are enjoying it! So, you popped
them in the oven. them in the oven.
Everyone has egg whites. Right, let's go back to Derbyshire
to see what Olly Smith has chosen to go with Michel's magical
meringues. With Michel's masterful meringues,
I am hunting a lucious, sweet desert wine. You could choose a
sauterne, but it risks being a touch too tangy. I have found
something a little rounder, a cracking bargain. It is the mighty
Chateau Les Sablines Monbazillac. Vivela France! When you are
matching wine with desert, always ensure that the wine is sweeter
than the pudding. Or the wine is too tart. This stretches back to
the 11th century, when the monks planted a vineyard on a hill. Honey
to the bee! This wean is super lucious. It has been intensified by
noble rot. Is gift from nature that gives boosting powers to sweetness
and acidity. That is what you need to match up to the brighter
flavours in the dish, the cherries and the roux bush. It has addles of
texture. The wine is rich. That is what I'm after to pair with the
glossy coulis and the chewy meringues. Finally, there is a
vanilla edge to the wine, that will pick up on the vanilla in the dish
and also the subtle a   aromatics of the herb.
Michel, you are the master. Sante! What do you think of the wine?
think this one is a little too sweet for me. I am not sure if it
is a complete match, but it is OK. It is a lovely wine, but is it the
perfect match, I am not sure. Chris, what do you reckon? It have
very    it is very, very nice. Girls? Lovely.
What do you think of your dead's choice? It is very good.
I think it is a match.    what do you think of your dad's
'Christine must time the cooking What goes on the plate first?
If you want more sauce, 'Christine has served a starter
'with risotto and a rice tuile, Absolutely perfect texture
Perfect. I think I need more salt Not because you didn't
Look at Arnaud's plate! Are you the chef?
This is my jus. It doesn't look as bad.
'Now, he has to carefully place his sumac spiced bread crust
'onto the lamb fillets.'
We're now late.
OK, Dick? Thank you.
Have they finished their starter? They are well finished the starter.
We've now got an empty table.
Service.
'Dick has served a main course of lamb with a sumac spiced crust,
'pea gnocchi, stuffed tomatoes, tomato petals
'and a pea, chorizo and tomato jus.'
The lamb in the croute is very good. The salt and pepper is perfect.
That lamb is professional. Yes. Really very good.
But, for the gnocchi, there is not enough salt and pepper.
The lamb was perfect, totally perfect. Heavenly cooked.
And I think it was delicious.
I think, maybe, the "bad thing" was the gnocchi,
which was a little bit tasteless.
And the little tomato, a lot of flavours. It was very nice.
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Next time, I'll do my gnocchi better.
Please, don't change anything with the lamb. No! Same again next time!
Macaroons to fill and bake, yeah? Yeah. Get the macaroons in.
We might get there.
'There's now just ten minutes for the macaroons to bake.'
Right, OK. Plates.
'But there's another problem with her green tea and pear mousse.'
They've not set.
Are you OK? No. I'm really not OK. I can't believe it.
'With time against her, Lisa has to use the partially set mousse.'
Right, we've got two minutes now.
We're getting there.
They're not cooked, are they?
'With the macaroons not ready, Lisa has to use a batch the chef made.'
Service, please.
'Lisa has made a quartet of pear desserts
'served with a caramel sauce.'
This is very, very beautiful.
The homemade pastry was fantastic. It's very difficult to make.
I can't do it.
Whoever's drawn the short straw to do the dessert really hit the spot.
Ah, merci.
It was fabulous. The one with the green tea was very exciting.
And I think everybody LOVE your sorbet.
It's very beautiful. Technically, it's very difficult.
Magnifique.
Merci. Thank you.
Thank you very much for the delightful dinner you gave us.
Every dish was wonderful and I think everybody agrees with me.
Thank you very much.
Right,
Right, it
Right, it is
Right, it is time to answer some of your foodie questions. Each caller
helps to decide what Chris is having at the end of the show. Will
it be another desert for him? First it is Tracy from Reading. What is
your question for us? I would like to know when I make my lemon tart
that the filling cracks when it cool down.
The reason is that you take the lemon tart from the oven when it is
cooked. You should leave it in the oven, open the door halfway and
take your lemon tart almost when it is cod out. So it will avoid to
crack the lemon tart, I believe. So the secret is to leave it in the
oven to cool down? Yes, half cool in the oven. And maybe try a
different recipe than the one from his book! I always make
Sainsbury's' one! Thank you very much. What dish would you like to
see at the end of the show, food heaven or food hell? It must be
hell for me! Brad. What is your question? I wanted to prepare some
lobster, what is your best way to prepare and serve them? Lobsters?
There are so many different ways of cooking lobster, a love will you
crustacean it could be pan fried. That is very nice, but you have to
do it all at the time, but otherwise grilled is lovely. In the
shell. Just split it in two in the shell. Otherwise a favourite for
the family is maybe poach in a lovely nage, a touch of water,
vinegar, lemon. With herbs in there.
Your trademark dish is lobster weeked with ginger? Yes.
Good luck with the lobster. What do you want to see at the end of the
show, food heaven or food hell? must be meat for me.
Intelligent viewer! Ann from Scarborough? What is your question?
I would like to know how to cook a whole salmon with the head and the
tail on. You need the right dish. It is
fairly big. Don't clean the salmon outside. Leave the lemon on it, it
is the scales. Everybody. Then put it in cold
water, lemon, thyme, bay leaves and salt. Salt, never hesitate to put
enough salt. The fish that is poached will only take what it
needs, never more. So put lots of salt and start it. When it reaches
the 95 degrees, lower it and cook it, the salmon for about 20 to 25
minutes a pound, but never boil it. Allow it to cool in the fish kettle.
Good luck with that one. What would you like to see at the end of the
show, food heaven or food hell? has to be hell! It is not looking
good! Now, the usual rules apply it is the omelette challenge. Alain,
who would you like to beat on the board? My dad.
He is sitting there, a respectable time. So, the three egg omelette,
cooked as fast as you can. You know the score, don't you? Yes, I do.
The clocks are on the screen, 3, 2, Look at the concentration on the
faces! Come on, Michel, come on! Oh, yes! There you go.
That's amazing! Right, I get to have a taste of this.
That was the time I should have asked for a pay rise! I missed that.
Is it?. I missed that. He has seasoned it.
Eseasoned mine. Did you? Yes, from the left hand.
It is still good. Alain. What do you say, 45 seconds? Do you
think that you beat your dad? think that I need a few years'
practise. You beat your dad. You did it in
26.68 seconds. A little bit higher.
I might give you a hug in a second, but I don't want to get carried
away. It all depends whether I accept
that as an omelette. There was a shell in there, did you
see that James? You did it... Look at him, Mr Confidence! You look it
in 23.92. That sits you there, but you are not going on it is not an
omelette, chef. Only joking. There is no way I'm going to say that.
For a second I thought you were a bad boy.
There you go, chef. Fantastic. Six Michelin stars
between them. Brilliant chefs. Will Chris get his idea of food
heaven or food hell. The majority of colleagues are going for hell,
but the guys in the studio have to decide yet. But first some food
from Antonio Carluccio. He is cooking in Lombardy. In the home of
the risotto. He has been asked to judge a risotto competition. It is
not a job for the faint hearted. in the town of Sannazzaro.
the main source And this is the annual
The ingredients are rucola, 'It's a fierce competition, and the 
This is rice with frogs. Other than taste, very important
The panel of judges was built from Maria Cornellio,
Some were made in the 16th century to irrigate the rice fields.
Now, the banks provide a wonderful larder of fresh herbs,
especially wild sorrel   just what I need to cook for the king of rice, Gabriele Felroni.
So poetic! He said he believes he was born in a rice field.
He feels so much about his rice, that he feels just like the child and the mother.
He adores rice. He lives for rice and he lives WITH rice too!
He's reputed to be the best risotto maker.
He's starting to flavour a bit of butter with some rosemary.
He takes it away just when there's scent.
And then he puts some meat in it   yes!
Some meat... some minced pork meat of a sausage.
Very soft and...a sausage.
We have something in common with our rice   the stock.
It's wonderful vegetable stock which we use for making risotto.
I want to show you the difference between the two risotto rices.
One is Vialone nano, typical of this area here,
and of the areas of Verona and Venice.
This one is what the Milanese use, this is Carnaroli.
The Rolls Royce of rices   wonderful!
My risotto is with white sorrel, what you saw me picking.
I'm starting with putting some butter and onion   very simple.
That's enough, now I put the rice in it...my Carnaroli rice...
..while Gabriele puts his to coat.
This is the first step, so you do it a little bit, like that.
Just stir the rice, coat it well.
Meanwhile, he has put the rice, with a little bit of olive oil.
Pure olive oil. And he wants to roast the rice a little bit.
This is essential so the rice absorbs moisture afterwards.
Now, we can start, and we will share this...
We will start to put, ladle by ladle...do you hear that?
And he will do his...
That's the beginning of a risotto.
Now you have to have patience for 20 minutes, slowly adding the liquid as it's required.
And in 20 minutes, you'll see the risotto's fantastic!
My second ingredient comes into the  risotto, because now it's halfway.
And that's what happens, that's my risotto with wild sorrel.
You can use the normal one. You don't need to go into the fields like I do.
You see now, that's the sausage and the rice and the stock.
And he doesn't stir it.
My last two ingredients are a good knob of fresh butter,
and quite a lot of parmesan.
And while I am beating it, Gabriele's doing the same, but putting different ingredients.
It is much drier than mine, but he said that's how they want it here.
This is cinnamon, this is the trick  of the risotto all'Isolana. Very special thing.
Now, we mix it all together, very gently... Yes...
Mmmmm!
The smell, oh, wow!
Typical Italian, waaooohhhh! You're like that, I imitate.
That's exactly how I want it.
Slightly wet, and his is a bit more dry.
Now is the big try.
Mmmmm....
It is wonderful, sausage, cinnamon.
Sorrel and nothing else   a little bit of butter.
Simple, but fantastic, provided you used those two rices.
Right
Right it
Right it is
Right it is time to find out if Chris is facing food heaven or food
hell. Everybody here has made their minds up. Look at that lovely
shoulder of lamb. A wonderful salad to go with it. Some of it shredded
And we turn to the chocolate. And here pile of pudding that we are
going to do. How do you think that they decided? I know I've been
stitched up. Michel and Louise went for heaven.
It was 4 3. You only brought me in to get me?
Yes! You're having pudding! Look at that lamb.
You can take it home. It is like that show, TISWAS, this
is what you could have won... Now, we have our egg, cream, sugar,
flour. Chef, can you flammaway the
bananas!    flambe. Here we have chocolate, butter,
funnily enough... I won't eat it. Funnily enough you fleed butter to
go in there too! I'm going to get go in there too! I'm going to get
this on. Now, I need to get these in the
oven. Straight in. Seven minutes.
Right, they are in there. So, more butter.
What if they said to you one week there is no butter on the show.
That is the week I'm not here. Sorry, James, the butter is
cancelled. But it is true, butter is flavour?
It brings texture as well. Right, eggs. We have a masterclass
of how to make custard or creme anglais. We have milk and cream.
I'll turn that up for you chef. Right explain what we are doing
with the bananas? I am doing them in batons. Cutting them lengthways
in a bit of butter and sugar to flambe them.
You have a bit of cognac as well. So, we are whipping up this.
You norm are doing stuff like this    normally are doing stuff like
this on TISWAS? I was normally throwing it.
We did the Phantom Flinger. It used to take us seconds to write
some of that. And where is Bob? He is in
Manchester running a candle shop. I'm not joking.
A very elegant candle. Come on, Bob, we have to have you
on the show. Now we are whisking up the eggs.
The bananas are cooking nicely. It needs a bit of lamb with it!
Lamb! We take the mixture here. How are we doing chef? We have
about four minutes left. Good.
In we go with the chocolate and the butter.
Give it a quick whisk. This is just like my school.
I wish I had gone to the school you went to if you had this. I just had
semolina and tapioca! Remember that! That was sure perb,
especially with a bit of lemon zest!    superb! Oops, too much
cognac there. Is that alright? Speak to your son.
Now, we are making ice cream. Even you could try this, Chris.
This lamb is looking lovely here. It is wasted lying. There
Chris, look. Bananas, vanilla, butter milk,
sugar, it's the butter milk. That is the left over bit.
That is the way that you normally cut them? Now, I'm blending it,
making ice cream. They are just frozen bananas.
We chop the bananas up and deep  freeze them. We are nearly there.
I can grab my plate. It is ready. How are we doing with that, chef?
You're trying to do the salesman on me, but you're not convincing me.
I'm not going to come on your show again? Of course you're not. You
only won �250. Fair enough, it was a drinks
question. It was.
Do you know what a cheeky Vimto is? It is a drink? Yes, but do you know
what it is in? It is a young person's drink!    do you know what
is in it? It's a young person's drink! You told me I would have a
really nice time on this show! When does the fun start? In a minute.
Look at that I'm going to leave it at that,
bananas and custard. I wish you wouldn't put that chocolate stuff
tonne. Oh, lovely.
Why not put on a hint of rhubarb now! What a laugh! I don't do
puddings. I don't know why. I like my food. I don't do puddings.
Oh, good! Oh, no! Perfect. I'm proper nervous.
So you should be. Lovely. Look at that.
Check that out. Right, bring over the glasses,
girls. Guys, dive in. Go on, dive in.
To go with this, Olly has chosen a Moscatel de Valencia. It is from
ASDA. It is �3.79. You can dive in.
I'll start. I like that. Look at disgusting! I'm sorry. You are a
very, very nice man. Brilliant. I didn't think it would
enlike that thank you very much to Michel and Alain Roux and Chris
Tarrant for being a great sport. Thank you very much to Louise and
Dawn. All of the recipes are on the website.
