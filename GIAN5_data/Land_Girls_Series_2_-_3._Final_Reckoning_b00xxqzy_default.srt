This is the BBC Home Service.
Here is the news...
Can this be me feeling so happy go lucky
Looking in your happy go lucky eyes
Can this be me feeling so happy go lucky
Me, what's always acted so smart and wise
Can this be me singing, oh!
Everything's ducky
Following you on your happy go lucky way
Well, this is me feeling so
Happy go lucky
Pardon me while I skip a kiss to say
Heaven blessed this happy go lucky day...
  Good kisser, was he?
  Who?
Don't always take a bloke to make me happy.
Oh, I'll send that back to London.
Mrs Gulliver brought it round.
I think her finger nails are still embedded in it.
He's coming at half 12.
  Today?
  I told you.
  You open it.
Look, please be back in good time. I've ironed you a clean shirt.
We're not going to Sunday service.
If you're not bothered about this christening, I'll talk to him on my own.
Why? So you can play the poor neglected wife?
Nice bit of smutter that. Lord knows where he thinks I'm going to wear it.
Look. Come back soon.
Connie, are those eggs burning?
Beautiful morning, isn't it?
  Any mail for me?
  I had it sent to your room.
I wasn't sure when you'd be down.
OK, thanks.
  You mind?
  Not at all. Sarah, would you set a place for Mr Gillespie?
Oh, don't bother, I got to run.
If any of my men come looking for me, would you tell them I'll be back when I can?
No, just tell them you haven't seen me.
Are you sure you wouldn't be more comfortable sitting down?
No, I'm fine, really.
All set?
Ready when you are.
Thanks.
Toodeloo.
  You going back to London then?
  You weren't supposed to read that.
Are you though?
Depends.
On?
On that bloke you kissed? Who was he?
  Never you mind.
  Ah, go on, tell me.
Get your own love life.
We was sat next to each other at the piano
and...
he...
looked into my eyes.
He leaned in to kiss me.
I felt tingly all over. I had been on the gin, though.
Hold on, the piano player?
  You don't mean Henry?
  Yeah, do you know him?
Well, yeah, he's...um...
Joyce...
  It could be one of ours.
  Then why bury it?
That plane they shot down last week.
  Were there any bodies in it?
  It was too burnt to tell.
So, some Jerry could be creeping about here?
You said clothes had gone missing.
And food. From inside the house.
  Are you serious?
  OK, let's not panic.
Well, it's easy for you to say, Billy.
Sometimes it's just me and the baby here.
Nothing's going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Anyway I'll take this in.
Find out if it's German.
In the meantime, stick together as much as you can
and keep your eyes peeled.
  Can't we get any closer?
  Not without them seeing us.
Well, this is no good.
Where did you get those?
This is a reconnaissance mission, isn't it?
That's the husband.
Sorry.
  I've got to go.
  Not so fast.
  How long have you been here? How long?
  Just last night.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It's a bit late for that, isn't it?
Have a good snoop around, did you? Before helping yourself to our rations.
  I didn't take anything.
  Liar!
I swear on my life. I just wanted somewhere to sleep.
Billy?
Come on, son.
What would you do if you were me? I'll tell you, shall I?
  You'd turn me over to the law.
  No.
Oh, course you would.
But it's all right for some people, isn't it, cos some people can get away with murder.
I was cleared.
Are you going to stand on the very spot it happened and tell me your conscience is clear?
I don't care where you go, you're not stopping here.
  Get away from him!
  I'm sorry!
Please, don't be scared.
  Hey! What do you want?
  I'm not going to hurt you, OK?
  Who are you?
  I'm Jack Gillespie. You knew my son, Cal.
He sent you here?
He was killed in action, eight weeks ago.
I'm sorry to bring bad news.
  No. I'm sorry. For you and your family.
  Thank you.
I'm sure your boy would want to know his father died a hero.
  He already has a father.
  Good. I'm glad.
  But you can see why I'm here.
  No.
  I had to see him.
  He's got nothing to do with you.
He's my grandson.
  I think you should leave.
  Please. Just hear me out.
I said go away. Before I call my husband.
Martin, have you hurt yourself?
That's iodine.
  What were you looking for?
  Nothing.
You don't have to hide it from me.
It's the sunlight, isn't it? It's hurting your eyes.
Look, we need to keep you up here and keep it dark.
But I need to go outside.
No, no, look. I'd rather you were here anyway and you heard what Billy said.
I need you to protect me.
Come on, it's not going to be forever, sweetheart.
If I go blind it will be.
It'll be dark forever.
Come here, come here...
That won't happen.
It won't happen.
Here, you won't believe who I just found in the barn.
It won't come off.
It won't come off.
  Esther, Esther, Esther.
  It won't come off.
  Esther.
  It's gold. It'll fetch in something.
But they won't give you what it's worth.
Well, then you tell me, you tell me what I should do.
I'll find the money.
How?
I'll find it.
  I want me money back, now!
  And I'd like a buxom wife,
but somehow I don't think that's going to happen either.
  That tractor's a pile of scrap!
  Yes, it is.
There's no point trying to tell me... What?
I said yes, it is. But I tell you what I'm going to do with you.
To make it up to you, I'm going to give you a very good price for that White Landrace Cross of yours.
  Chamberlain is not for sale!
  Oh, I'm sorry, one of the family now!
Thought I could spot a resemblance.
That's it, come on.
Finch, you'll embarrass yourself.
  Come on, put 'em up!
  Don't you think we're getting a bit old for this?
Never! What are you, a coward!
I've got an idea.
Your son against mine.
Oh, yeah, and we'll make it official.
  How do you mean official?
  Proper boxing rules, referee, spectators.
  We could sell tickets.
  Winner takes all.
  And the tractor money?
  Tomorrow night.
Oh, my God! You're a vicar!
Are you out of your mind? We're on red alert if you hadn't noticed.
All the more reason for it! Bit of fun on a Saturday night. Keep everyone's mind off things.
  Has it occurred to you that I can't box?
  Well, neither can Ernie.
  How do you know?
  Oh, come on, you're smarter than he is.
  You'll run rings 'round him.
  No, I won't. Because I'm not doing it.
I've already shook hands on it.
You fight him then. I've got enough to worry about.
Billy.
It's for Martin.
He's running out of time, son.
  Is that a yes, or a no?
  Yes.
We've got some more biscuits if you're still hungry.
No, thanks. I'm fine, thank you.
  Perhaps we should start without your husband?
  Yeah, of course.
We've talked about dates and I have pencilled you in for the 24th.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, no, not at all.
  We've just started.
  Right.
Hey, William, come on Daddy's knee.
  Come on, bouncy, bouncy.
  Oh, look at that.
He's the spit of you. Right, where were we?
Er yeah, the 24th, OK...
Don't worry. I have a few tricks up my sleeve.
Yeah?
Anything else up there?
  Mr Gillespie?
  What's up, Duchess?
What's up is I don't appreciate having to play your secretary.
  I've been making excuses for you all morning.
  Sorry, won't happen again.
See that it doesn't.
I have better things to do with my time while the pair of you slope off together.
We went to see my grandson. Thanks for your help, by the way.
Meant a lot.
He's only interested in the child.
I hope you know that.
Oh, my goodness. Of course!
  You want him for yourself.
  Don't be absurd.
It all makes sense.
The disapproving looks.
Warning me against him.
I was concerned for you.
And all because he makes your heart go pitter patter.
I wouldn't go near Jack Gillespie if he was the last man on Earth.
No, of course not. But just so you know, they're not all like Lawrence.
You might actually have to work to catch this one.
Oof. That's good, son.
See, it's not fair them conscripting you.
I need you here with me.
You've got the land girls now, Dad.
I still need you. Isn't it about time you told Bea?
You can't keep it from her forever, son.
I know that Dad, will you stop going on at me?
Agh!
What happened?
You wrapped it up wrong.
  What you still doing here?
  Needs to be tighter, support the ligaments.
  What do you know about it?
  Well, I've got some experience.
Regimental champion, two years running.
Maybe, erm... you can give Billy some pointers.
Sorry, things to do, like finding a roof over my head.
Oh, and you wrap it round the thumb, by the way.
Listen, you help him to win, and you can stay.
Half a crown. Oh, no, no! I know it sounds steep but I can promise you a fight to remember.
Yeah, the tall one   fists like... like cannon balls.
But my money is on the short one.
Stone cold killer. So, any takers?
Hey, there we are, there we go,
plenty for everyone.
There we are.
Afternoon.
Afternoon, vicar. It's a lovely day for it?
Mr Finch.
Well, well, what have we here?
Bless you, bless you, Mr Finch, you are a God send.
They're for my evening sermon.
An evening sermon?
  What a marvellous idea. What's it about?
  The war.
  David Vs Goliath, clever.
Isn't it? Oh, yes.
You can certainly count on my attendance.
It's men only. Servicemen only.
To rouse their spirits so they can fight the good fight.
Good for you, Reverend.
Good for you.
You really are a man of God. If there's anything I can do for you.
  Mrs Fisher.
  I had to come and see it for myself.
The great Sergeant Tucker taking charity.
No job. No home. No family.
Pathetic really.
When the war ends, what will you have to go home to? If you even have one.
I've got my husband.
  My husband.
  I'm sorry, I heard he was missing.
He is missing but I know he's alive.
John is alive, no thanks to you.
You're right. I'm sure you're right.
Mrs Fisher.
No.
Connie?
Connie, wait.
Why did you run off like that yesterday?
  Have a good laugh, did you? With Finch and the boys.
  Eh?
In the pub. Very nice, I'm sure.
No you shouldn't be embarrassed.
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.
I'm the one who can't control myself.
Couldn't, couldn't control myself.
  I swear it won't ever happen again.
  Thanks a bunch.
No, no, no... Of course I would... I'd love to...
But I took advantage of you and that was wrong.
  It was wrong.
  Do you know what?
I've never been so insulted in all my life.
So you and me had a smooch, who cares?
Oh, but you care, don't you?
And you know why? Cos of that.
Yeah, thought as much. Shame, I quite liked you.
Connie, Connie.
Do not follow me.
You looked like you might need it.
Thank you.
You know, Cal never told me about the child.
After he died, some kid in his company wrote me.
Said he thought I should know.
Perhaps your son was waiting for the right time.
I don't know.
He was usually pretty up front about stuff.
Truth is, I don't think he had any mind to.
Funny, isn't it? How I had to lose one boy to find the other.
Enjoy the show, boys.
Yeah, all of it. All of it on Billy Finch to win.
You are looking very lovely this evening, Mrs Reeves.
Perhaps you'd like to come to the house afterwards?
For a drink. Toast the winner.
That's not going to happen, is it, Vernon?
I wouldn't be seen dead with you.
Remember, a glove's not just a weapon, it's a shield.
Keep your guard up. Don't listen to them, it's just noise.
Oi, look at me.
All that exists is what's inside this ring,
all right?
Martin?
Martin!
Ladies and gentlemen!
We've got quite a show for you tonight!
So without further ado,
let me first introduce, the unstoppable,
Billy Finch!
And let me introduce,
the unbeatable,
Walter "The Bonecrusher" Storey!
  He's in trouble.
  I thought he was inside for manslaughter.
  You said...
  Your son against mine. He got time off for good behaviour.
Billy, Billy.
Come on, I'll give the money back.
  You can't fight him.
  You were misled. Billy, he's a maniac.
  No shame in backing out.
  Please listen, there's been a mistake.
You've got to give me my money back.
All bets are in, love.
  I'll fight.
  No, he'll kill you.
  I'll be all right.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Are you hurt?
You've ripped your stockings.
It's all right. There's plenty more where they came from.
What you doing here, anyway?
Me? I love boxing.
Go on, Billy!
Hello?
Mister?
Mister.
Uh!
Come on!
  You're doing well. You're doing well.
  I can't hurt him.
Look, keep up the body blows. He'll tire soon enough.
  But if I can't knock him out...
  Trust me.
Keep digging at his stomach. He'll lower his arms,
then come in with an uppercut, hard as you can.
You're doing good, Billy, you're doing good.
Come on, he's a kid. What's the matter?
Keep moving away from him.
Jab, jab, jab, move, jab, jab.
  Just lay him out! Go on!
  Do it.
Keep those arms up.
Now, Billy!
Now!
Come on, Billy!
One...two...three...
  four...
  Get up.
  ..five...six...
seven...eight...
  Get up!
  ..nine...
Billy!
  I thought you'd left me to die.
  I'm sorry. It was my mam.
  She wouldn't let me out the house.
  Why?
  What have you said to her?
  Nothing, I swear.
I've not been well.
I've not been so well myself.
Good boy.
You're out!
I knew you'd do it, son.
I love you, Billy.
Where have you been?
You've been gone over an hour, Martin.
I just went for a walk.
I hate being stuck inside   and the moonlight doesn't hurt my eyes.
Please don't tell Mum.
All right, but you'd better get into bed. They'll be back soon.
Bea.
Thanks, Esther.
What about me?
Easy!
"Put a bet on, Esther. It'll be a sure thing, Esther."
  I said I was sorry.
  What for?
Getting Billy hurt   or for losing me what last bit of money I had?
  I'll get it back.
  You've done enough.
It's down to me.
Come and sit down. Let's get you some breakfast.
Thanks.
Four rounds, eh! Who'd have thought?
Oh, yeah, could go professional(!)
  I just wanted to say, we're all proud of you.
  Hear, hear!
I've...
..I've also got something to say.
  Lady Diana.
  I'm so sorry to intrude.
No, not at all, come in.
Don't get up, gentlemen, please. Finish your breakfasts.
I have just come to have a quick word with Mrs Finch, if I may?
I don't understand what he wants.
  Just to see him.
  Yes, but why?
  He's grieving, Billy.
He needs to say goodbye to that last piece of his son...
  before he leaves...for good.
  Well, he's got no right
  to ask and, with respect, Lady Diana, neither do you.
  Billy.
It's all right.
I've known you since you were a boy.
I'd never do anything to harm you...or your family.
Could you give me a minute with my husband?
Of course. I'll be in the car.
How can you even consider it? Have you forgotten how Cal treated you?
Of course not. But what kind of people does it make us if we say no?
I don't care. I didn't trust his son and don't trust him.
You trust me, though, don't you?
Cal's gone, Billy.
Don't make this into something it's not.
I just don't want you getting hurt again.
He can't hurt me. I've got you now, haven't I?
It's a woman. Who is she?
Joyce. She works with us on the farm.
  You betrayed me.
  No.
Martin?
Martin?
Don't move!
Down on your knees.
  Don't hurt her.
  Shut up!
We found your parachute. Just a matter of time before they find you.
I had hoped to see you at the service today.
  Well, I had things to do.
  Yeah, of course.
Well, I took the liberty of holding a collection for Martin.
Take heart, Mrs Reeves   "God will provide".
"God will provide"? My son's going blind.
Do you really think a few shillings from the collection box will solve that?
  I'm sorry.
  No, don't be. I'm sorry I couldn't do more.
No, no, it was very kind.
"Ask and ye shall receive.
"Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you."
  Connie, have you seen Martin?
  Not since breakfast.
  Miss Carter.
  Reverend.
  I should be going.
  Bye bye.
Unless...
..you would care to accompany me on a stroll?
Empty your pockets.
Do it!
Is that it?
  What about that one?
  There's nothing.
That leg looks bad. I could get you a doctor.
Do you take me for a fool?
No... No. But you're sick.
You need medicine.
I need to get out of here, that's what I need.
He's a fine looking boy.
Strong already. You can see that.
Do you mind?
  Bea, I... Is it all right if I call you that?
  Mm hm.
I know we got off to a bad start, but there's nothing for you to be scared of.
I just want to do what's right here, for both of you.
Sit down, if you like.
It's all right. You can hold him.
Hey. Hey, champ.
I'm your grandpa.
What you doing?
The boy lost.
Well, that weren't your fault.
A deal's a deal.
I could, er,
use an extra pair of hands around the place.
Be losing me lad soon.
I live in Chicago, Illinois.
On the Great Lake.
And when I say "Lake", I don't mean a pond, like this.
It's a stretch of water as big as the ocean.
I got a huge yard, with a porch swing. A dog.
  And that's where Cal grew up?
  Born and bred.
  Right, well, I should get back.
  We're just talking here.
  About what?
How this place isn't good enough?
All I'm saying is, you've got options  
an opportunity for your boy.
Meaning?
Let me take him off your hands. Bea, listen to me.
You're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you.
You shouldn't be stuck in a dead end town, married to some farm hand.
Don't you dare say anything about my husband.
Billy is a good man.
Which is more than I can say for your son.
  I know Cal made mistakes...
  "Mistakes"?
You know where he told me he was from? Idaho.
That's right.
Everything that came out of Cal's mouth was a lie.
That's the kind of boy you raised, Mr Gillespie.
So, all that opportunity that you're talking about, it doesn't really amount to much, does it?
You wanted to see your grandson, and you have. Now, leave us alone.
  Let me take you home.
  I'll walk!
Bea!
The whole country's the same, you know. There's nowhere to hide.
You think I don't know that?
  Then where are we going?
  Liverpool.
  You'll never get on a boat.
  Just shut up and drive.
It'll be hard enough to get you on a train. You can hardly walk.
  Do you have a better idea?
  Yeah, just surrender.
They'll feed you, they'll give you medicine.
You think I don't know what happens to German prisoners?
  Well, whatever you've been told, it's not true.
  Be quiet.
You'd just have to work in the fields.
  You know, you get to sit out the rest of the war.
  I said be quiet!
She thought it was me, I had crumbs all down my front.
Serves you right... Oh!
I told you to change your shoes.
I ain't clumpin' about in wellies, thank you. Not on me day off.
Why not? You'd look good in anything.
  Ah, you're a softie, aren't ya?
  Hey, there's Connie.
  Hey, Connie.
  Hey, Connie.
You know those guys?
Yeah, I know a lot of men. Ain't you heard?
  No, no, I hadn't.
  Well, now you know.
You've got competition. Quite a bit of competition, as it happens.
Did you hear me?
  Yes.
  Good.
Then keep your poxy flower. Takes a lot more than that to impress me.
Do yourself a favour and find yourself a nice girl.
I have.
I have.
What do you want?
It doesn't concern you.
Oh, I'll decide what concerns me.
Stay away from my family. I won't ask again.
My wife indulged you today out of respect for your loss.
Don't expect me to do the same.
Now, get off my property.
Our son's a Finch. He never was a Gillespie.
  He's not your blood.
  My husband told you to leave.
When you've come to your senses, you know where to find me.
Offer still stands.
What offer?
We'll have to change trains.
  Don't lie to me.
  I'm not lying.
There is no direct train to Liverpool.
We'll have to change at Coventry.
Coventry?
  What's funny?
  The last time I saw Coventry it was on fire.
I wonder if it's still burning.
  What happened?
  She won't let me near him!
I've laid everything out on a plate for her and she...
She...
You're a businessman, Mr Gillespie. And this isn't business.
This involves a child.
  The harder you push, the more she'll resist.
  So what do I do?
Just give her time.
I'm not a patient man.
Run, run, run!
  Give it to me.
  Stay there.
You're not going to shoot me,
so you might as well give me the gun.
While we're away we dream
The way all soldiers do
We dream of loving you
While we're away
We dream of loving you
While we're away.
