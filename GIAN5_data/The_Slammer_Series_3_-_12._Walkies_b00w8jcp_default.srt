"Dear Mum. Thanks for your last letter and I really like the stamp.
"This week's Freedom Show was the most exciting yet. Stupendous acts.
"And stupid acts.
"And an act that went with a bang.
"It all started when a new inmate checked into The Slammer."
You've been found guilty of a howling showbiz crime
So welcome to The Slammer
Where you're going to serve your time
With every type of minstrel, entertainer and artiste
Performing to the limit to try and get released
So go fetch the audience, bring them to The Slammer
And polish up your act with a bit of glitz and glamour
Your fate is in their hands
So make them cheer and clamour
It's the only way you'll ever leave The Slammer
It's the only way you'll ever leave The Slammer
No, sir, I don't know how the prisoner escaped.
Yes, sir, I know it means we've lost an act for today's Freedom Show.
Yes, but we've still got Planet Jumprope.
And Woody the one man band.
And Vampire Ascendants.
Plus, I've got my very best warden on the case, sir. Yes, and you, sir.
  Any luck, Gimbert?
  Actually, yes, Uncle.
I've found a fiver!
New inmate to sign in. This is Britney Spaniel, sir.
World famous dog trainer. And that must be Dynamo, the poodle of peril.
The things you've taught that dog are astonishing.
  How can it speak seven languages?
  How does it stay on that motorbike?
  I always like it when it plays the tuba.
  Very nice to meet you.
  Sit!
Good boy. Now, come on, beg.
Beg!
Good boy! Who's a clever boy? That's better.
  Actually, Mrs Spaniel, I'll need to take all your belongings.
  Bad boy!
No treat for you.
Now, I hear there's a spare place in today's Freedom Show.
Ah, yes, well, there is an official protocol for that.
  Play dead.
Good boy. So, it's settled then, Governor?
I'll take the last place in the Freedom Show?
Yes, boy? Yes?
  Yes?
  Yes! Yes!
  Good boy!
  Er, Miss Spaniel.
  What, Peter?
I am trying to get ready for the show!
Well, I was wondering... We were wondering, can I get my bunk back?
  You don't expect Dynamo to...
..sleep on the floor? He is a professional poodle of peril!
Yeah, well, it's not fair. He's got my bunk, he's got my clothes,
  he's got my mobile phone.
  Yes.
Oh, poor Dynamo. All that sleeping. You must be hungry.
Munchies time! Munchies!
Hey, that's my lunch!
  Are you about to go on stage to perform?
  No, thanks to you.
Dynamo needs his strength.
He's going to be performing his greatest stunt yet!
  The doggy cannonball.
  Yeah, well, never mind about all that.
  What am I supposed to eat?
  Minced liver and bone meal?
It will give you strong teeth and vitality. Open wide.
  Ohh!
  There you go. One more. Good boy.
She's rude, she's bossy and she made me eat dog food.
  Oh, that's awful.
  You're right. 85 percent offal.
I thank you!
She's virtually taken over The Slammer, sir.
There's dog hairs in the shower, most of F wing is out on morning walkies
and in the canteen, they eat out of bowls on the floor.
On the up side, she has managed to train Gimbert.
Sorry, can't stop. She wants me to fetch her slippers
and she'll punish me if I'm late.
This is too much.
We can't let Britney Spaniel appear on the Freedom Show.
She'll have half the audience sniffing their own bottoms!
We've got to find a way to stop her walking all over us.
Walking I said, not walkies. Out.
Not in here! Go! Out, out, out!
The audience are coming in. You sure this plan will work, Peter?
  I think so.
  If we can get rid of Spaniel,
Jonathan and Emma have agreed to be the final act in the Freedom Show.
  Hello!
  Let's just hope that you and Gimbert can pull it off.
  Now, how do I look?
  Grrreat!
  Thank you very much.
In that case, it's show time!
'Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to HMP Slammer,
'where you decide which prisoner is to be released!
'Now please welcome your host, he's the top dog round here,
so bark and cheer for the Governor!
  Who's the Governor?
  You are the Governor!
Oh, yeah! What great jailors and jailbirds we've got
and what a great Freedom Show we've got for you.
Yes, we've got some marvellous acts. We've got Planet Jumprope!
  Whooo!
  We've got Woody the one man band.
  Whooo!
  A fantastic act called Dynamo the doggy cannonball.
Whooo!
Onto our first performing prisoner act.
It's Vampire Ascendants!
If we live our life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again
Kill the prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can hide the truth inside
  It could be wrong, could be wrong
  But it shouldn't be right
  It could be wrong, could be wrong
  To let our hearts ignite
  It could be wrong, could be wrong
  Are we digging a hole?
  It could be wrong, could be wrong
  This is out of control
  It could be wrong, could be wrong
  It can never last
  It could be wrong, could be wrong
  Must erase it fast
  It could be wrong, could be wrong
  But it could've been right
  It could be wrong, could be
  Love is our...
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed
The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm
Resistance
Come down! Come down, naughty.
Naughty vampires! I don't like it when they do that.
Trying to escape. They can't until you let them go in the Freedom Show.
Well, Vampire Ascendants.
  Miss?
  I think it was really scary but exciting.
Cos when they vampire jumped off of there,
I thought my heart was going to explode cos it looks really scary.
  Did you like the Vampire Ascendants?
  Yes.
  What did you think?
It was amazing. I liked all the acrobats. It was like Twilight.
  Twilight? What's that?
  It's a movie.
And for one final word, sir, sum that act up for me.
  Fliptastic.
  Fliptastic.
Right, final rehearsal, Dynamo.
The world's first doggy cannonball!
Just a teeny amount of gunpowder.
  Er, Miss Spaniel.
  What is it, Peter?
  Do you need de worming?
  No, Officer Gimbert needs to see you urgently.
What does he want? He should be asleep in his basket!
Whoa! I'll show you, Spaniel spanner!
Making me eat dog food and Gimbert act like a weirdo!
Yeah! Come on, little Dynamo, you're going to be a blast!
Oh! You are cheeky, Mr...Cheeky.
Please give a big hand to Planet Jumprope!
Whooo!
Television
Give them a big cheer there! Marvellous! Well, Planet Jumprope.
Will they be jumping out of The Slammer? Let's find out.
Right then, sir. Skip To My Lou or pile of poo?
It was very cool and I loved the costumes and crazy music.
  How crazy was the music?
  Very crazy.
  Crazy enough for you?
  Just about.
  You don't want it too much more crazy than that.
  Too crazy.
  It would be too crazy or it is too crazy?
  Would be.
  It would be too crazy, wouldn't it?
  Young man, tell us all about it.
When I heard the name, I thought it was going to be not that good,
but they've proved that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover,
  cos it was excellent.
  You think they're going free?
  Yeah.
  Good man.
Are you related to Ray Winstone at all?
  Definitely.
  Yeah, I thought you were.
  Sum that act up, sir, in one word.
  Erm, weird.
  Weird, sir.
  There they are, Planet Jumprope. Three, six, nine...
There you are. I'm extremely busy getting ready for the Freedom Show.
  What is it?
  The Freedom Show? It's a big performance the Governor puts on
  with loads of acts and...
  No! I mean what did you want to see me about?
Oh, yes. I mean, no. Yes. No.
Yes. No.
  No idea, sorry.
Right now, it's time for Solitary Confinement!
Oh, yes! One performing prisoner, maybe more,
whose crimes against showbiz were so bad we have to keep them away from
all the other prisoners in The Slammer. If they do well,
we give them a treat. Today, if they do well,
we're going to give them a trip to the shop.
If they don't do well, it's back to their cell for a cruel punishment!
  Mr Burgess!
  Sir?
  What is today's cruel and unusual punishment?
Today, sir, it's being pumped full of popcorn
while plugging in a hairdryer, sir.
All right, that is cruel and unusual, so we need a judge.
  Who could be the judge? Mr Burgess.
  What about you, sir?
  Up you go.
  Give him a round of applause!
  What's your name?
  Miles.
  All right then, Miles, it's up to you
as we go for today's Solitary Confinement!
Come on, Miles.
Somewhere over the rainbow
Some...
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
Having...
Stop me now
Hmm... ball
Don't stop me now
Don't stop me... now
Ohh
Racing car
Flying
Lady Godiva
Oh, oh, oh
Explode
Hm, tonight
Supersonic man out of you
There we are. Thank you, Simon.
Give him a round of something.
Now's the moment of decision. You are deciding.
All in your thumb is what's going to happen to that man. Thumbs up,
he's off to the shop. Thumbs down and it's pop pop pop pop pop.
What about that thumb? The thumb of destiny, sideways.
Five seconds, up or down? What's it to be?
It's up, it's up, down! Oh!
Back to the cell with you, Medley.
Give him a round of something and a big hand for Miles.
  Good lad! Yeah! Off you go!
There he goes. Wait a minute. There it is.
Ooooh. WHIRRING AND POPPING
  Ooh, dear, nasty.
On now to our next performing prisoner. Well, he's marvellous.
He encapsulates lots of different sounds into just one arena.
It's Woody and his one man band!
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes, yee hah
Singing aye aye yippee yippee aye
Singing aye aye yippee yippee aye
Singing aye aye yippee, aye aye yippee
Aye aye yippee yippee aye
You've been found guilty of a howling showbiz crime
So welcome to The Slammer
Where you're going to spend your time
With every kind of minstrel, entertainer and artiste

So bring on the audience and welcome to The Slammer

HE PLAYS KAZOO Thank you very much!
There we are! Go on, then. Whoa!
Off he goes. Off he goes. Woody. Ohh!
Let's find out what you thought of that unusual act.
Well, Woody the one man band there. But was he Woody or was he wooden?
  I thought he was marvellous.
  Why?
I just like the idea of a one man band.
  Did you like the songs?
  A bit, yeah.
  Was there a favourite one there?
  Erm, Coming Round The Mountain.
Did you like Woody and what was the best bit?
  I did like it.
  Yes.
  And I like it when that thing came off his hat.
  Ooh, it looks like Gimbert.
  What about you, Miss?
  I really enjoyed it.
I wanted to get up and start dancing and singing with him.
  Would you like to do it now?
  Yes.
Can we have a bit of music, Mr Woody? Thank you.
  Do you want to sing?
  Oh, yeah!
  Take my mic.
Have some fun, don't sit down
Always get up and dance
If you can't think of anything just do what you want
Because this is time to enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Don't sit down
And enjoy yourself a bit more
Now I'm on stage
Hold on. Hold on a minute.
Just a minute.
That's got to be a crime against entertainment. Solitary confinement!
Let's get you in here. Wait there.
This is getting to be a habit.
  Mr Burgess?
  Sir?
  Have you booked her for next week's show?
  Absolutely, sir.
  Very good. Give her a round of applause.
  We'll keep her in there till next week. Well done.
  Thank you, sir.
  All under control, sir.
  Thank you.
  Right! And, miss, a final word.
  Fantastic.
  Fantastic, sir.
Hello, Mrs Doggy Lady! Hiya, Britney.
It's Miss Spaniel to you. And you.
Why are they here? I thought I was the last act in the Freedom Show.
Er, yes, you are. They're just, er, watching.
Fine, they can watch my final rehearsal.
Dynamo, ready? Good boy!
  Come on. In you go.
Well, performing felon fans, one more performing act to see.
Oh, don't be so pathetic!
It's only a tiny little...
  Dynamo!
She always said his career would be stratospheric. You're on. Go, go!
It's a change of programme here at the Freedom Show.
Unfortunately, not Dynamo the doggy cannonball,
but at the last moment, a spectacular illusionist.
Jailors and jailbirds, please show your appreciation
for Jonathan Shotton! Yes!
Hey, guys! Now, for as long as I can remember,
I've always wanted to fly and float in the air. I know I'm not alone,
so I'll give somebody the chance. Who would like to float in the air?
Yes, you'd be fantastic! Would you join me on the stage?
  All of this applause is for you.
  What's your name?
  Rafaela.
Now, there's three things you need in order to float.
The first is a flying carpet.
And I've got one of those for you. Hold onto that safely.
There's two other things you need. The first are some stepladders.
I've got two of those here. And finally, a plank of wood.
If we pick that up and that will sit on top of the two stepladders
just like so. Now, this is perfectly safe.
It'll take my weight, so it'll certainly take yours, Rafaela.
If I take that flying carpet back, we'll spread out the carpet
over the plank of wood, just like so.
And in a moment, I'm going to ask you if you wouldn't mind sitting
on top of the carpet. Do you think you could give that a go?
Sit right in the middle for me. Let's see if we can make this work.
This is real magic.
Lie yourself back for me, just like so. That's wonderful!
A little bit further back if you wouldn't mind? Wonderful.
And you can cross your arms across your tummy for me.
And your feet, as well.
This is, like I said, real magic. Are you ready, boys and girls?
Yes!
Ladies and gentlemen, Rafaela! That's it! Stand up for me!
They're going to give you a huge round of applause! Thank you!
They're running away.
Oh, what an illusion! How on earth did they do that?
Have you any ideas? Mr Burgess.
Well, let's start off with the lady at the centre of that act. Miss?
It was really scary because I thought I was going to die.
  Why would you think you were going to die?
  I couldn't see what was going on
and I was just looking at the ceiling.
  Do you sleep?
  Yes.
  You can't see what's going on then.
  Yeah, that's why I get scared sometimes.
  You do?
  But, on the whole, did you enjoy the act?
  Yes.
You think you know how they do it, don't you?
  Yes.
  You've drawn a diagram. Hold it up.
What's your theory behind this diagram?
The plank of wood with a south facing magnet,
the one at the bottom with a north facing magnet inside.
The north attracting the south stops it from wobbling
and the south repelling the south keeps it in the air.
Thank you from Science Today. No, that's not how it's done.
  Sum that act up for me, Miss.
  Magical.
  Magical, sir.
Jailors and jailbirds, it's the moment you've all been waiting for.
The moment of truth where we find out who's going free
from the Freedom Show. Before that, let's welcome them all back!
The sensational acts, Vampire Ascendants,
Planet Jumprope,
Woody the one man band
and, at the last minute, Jonathan Shotton and Emma!
Give them a big cheer! Now, you know how this works.
You make noise and Gimbert's clapometer turns it into points.
The highest points, well, they're the winners and they go free.
The others, they stay for tea. Let's get on to the important business.
We have got marvellous acts. Kicking it off were Vampire Ascendants!
Come on, let's hear it for them!
  Vampire Ascendants!
Good score! 71.2! Well done the vampires!
Now, the second act you saw, well, they took skipping into a new realm.
Will they be going free? It's Planet Jumprope!
Into the lead with 86.7 is Planet Jumprope! Yeah!
Next, he was loveable and cute, he had a little furry thing in his hat.
Yes, it was Woody the one man band!
Oh, Woody, looks like you're staying for tea, as well. 76.1.
Very close. Still in the lead, Planet Jumprope.
Only one act can stop them. He was mysterious, Jonathan Shotton!
Oh!
Wow! It's close, it's close. Let's see. A score of 86.3.
86.7, though, going free, it's Planet Jumprope!
Just pipped at the post! They're going free! Off you go, guys!
They're going free! Give them a big cheer and a round of applause!
Mr Burgess, what's for tea tonight?
Well, tonight, sir, it's a beautiful cod fillet in a golden batter
with mushy peas, chips, two rounds of bread and butter and tea for two.
  That's amazing! Really?
  No, sir! It's not!
It's lumpy porridge, sir!
Get him back! Off you go. Give them a cheer and a round of applause.
There you go, jailors and jailbirds.
Remember, we're waiting for you, we're watching you
and if you can't sing, dance or rhyme...
Don't do the crime!
It's the only way you'll ever leave The Slammer
Lunar five to base, it's looking good up here.
Setting course for... Hold on a minute! I don't believe this!
Houston, we have a poodle.
