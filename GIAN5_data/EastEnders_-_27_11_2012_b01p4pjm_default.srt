  Give me that jacket.
  All right?
  Be careful.
  Just slowly.
  Go slowly, go slow, go slow.
  Ow!
  All right?
  You all right?
  Yeah.
I could make breakfast.
No, I tell you what you can do. You can get a bin bag,
stick Joey's stuff in it, will you, please?
  No!
  You think it's all right?
  Him doing a runner, state he left you in?
  Not now, Max.
He nearly killed her, then strolls into the sunset like nothing happened!
  No, Dad, it wasn't like that...
  There is no sense in making Lauren relive this.
Could you put the kettle on? We can do the whys and wherefores later.
Mum. You KNOW that it wasn't Joey's fault.
The crash maybe, but that doesn't excuse the rest of it.
  I love him, Mum. I do.
  He's your COUSIN, Lauren!
We knew you wouldn't understand. That's why we were running away.
You count yourself lucky
your dad doesn't know what's been going on under his roof.
  I don't care who knows!
  Yes, you do care! You do!
You might not think you do right now,
but in the long run, you will care.
Mum, I just need you to go and get him. Please.
Cos I can't live without him.
He's probably miles away by now.
Nice to see you, son.
Glad to see you've had a change of heart.
I haven't.
I've only come back for Alice.
You haven't been over the road yet?
Why would I?
I thought you might be sticking around a bit longer,
you know, what with everything that's happened.
That's what families do, isn't it?
In a moment of crisis, they stick together.
Sorry, Dad. It's too late.
Who was there when you needed help, eh?
Who was the one who pulled you out of a burning building?
I'm the victim in this as well, you know   it's my car he trashed!
Everything I tried with you   what do I get back? Nothing!
Don't let him destroy what we've got here, Alice!
Don't!
You hungry?
Want to look at my new shoes?
This conversation hasn't finished. Do you hear me?
All right?
  I didn't expect you back this soon...
  Don't say you forgot, Derek?
Is that a bear's head in there?
  Is this Alice?
  Yeah.
  Well, you ain't what I was expecting!
All right, darling? Excuse me.
Best thing we can do now is just carry on as normal, isn't it?
  That means you, off to sixth form, please.
  Mum!
Off you go.
You OK, Tan?
Babe? Something else eating you?
If you want to see your mum, I'll wait here, I'll look after Lauren.
You got a lot to sort out, you two, ain't you?
She was right, weren't she?
You mess about in other people's lives and someone always gets hurt.
Well, you did what you thought was best, didn't you?
I can't think about it right now.
Lauren's got to come first. You go to work. I'll keep an eye on her.
Mum can wait.
You see Pops, you see   you and me, yeah?
We're written in the stars.
Cos that kiss was out of this world, yeah?
So, why don't we jump on board this romantic rocket
and ride it somewhere hotter than the sun, huh?
Sounds good, I'll get me toothbrush.
Mo! I wish you wouldn't let yourself in like that.
Spot checks. It's in the rental agreement, Arthur.
Yeah, but we never signed no agreement.
Must've been verbal, then.
It's just that... I get a little freaked out, so...
Good job you're usually asleep when I visit at night, then, eh?
Lucky girl, that Poppy.
If I was only 20 years younger...
So where you going to sleep now that we're all back, Uncle Derek?
You ain't been in my bedroom, have you?
Pat wouldn't be spinning in her grave, she'd break out of the coffin
and come back and give me a slap if she knew you'd been sleeping in there!
He hasn't. It's not practical you staying here. Not enough space.
I know that. I know that. Especially now Bianca's out the nick.
  I was leaving today anyway.
  Oh, no!
Look, why don't you and Liam go in with Morgan?
Tiff's at Ricky's anyway until after this Christmas concert thing.
  She's going to be so brilliant, ain't she?
  Course she will. Yeah.
Thanks, Bianca, but Alice's actually heading back to our mum's...
Actually, I was thinking of getting somewhere bigger myself, anyway.
So these two could come and stay whenever they wanted.
Yeah. Well, don't hold your breath, will you? Come on.
  Nice to meet you.
  Yeah. And you.
  See you later.
  See you, Alice. All right?
Excuse me a minute.
You sure they're Derek's kids?
She's like a little mouse and he is WAY too fit.
  Oi!
  I'm just saying!
Bye, Dad.
Here, that Fatboy should be more grateful.
  He's got that house at a steal.
  Oh, leave him alone, poor kid.
Here Kat, you seen this? Front of the gazette.
Bang out of order. Look, "Christmas Cutbacks   no Christmas lights
"on tree in Albert Square this Christmas."
Can't have a Christmas tree without lights or decorations, can you?
That's a bit like, you know... Easter without Easter eggs,
or Passover...
without...passovers?
Well, if you care so much, do something!
And if you want more rent money, get another tenant!
What's pushed her buttons?
Mo, do us a favour, come round the bar and help Kat, will you?
Why? Where you off to?
Well, if the council won't give us Santa Claus,
it's up to yours truly, ain't it, eh?
  So, no one knows where Janine is?
  Nah.
  She just took off.
  Poor little mite.
Perhaps we should go round to Michael's, see how he's coping.
First things first. I'm going to get myself a job.
Can't that wait? Your prison earnings can tide you over for now.
What, 40 poxy quid?
Just don't go near the caff.
I don't need to.
Things are going to be different now.
Your mum is not relying on hand outs or dodgy schemes.
I'm going to have a career, maybe even my own business one day.
How is my niece, after her terrible ordeal?
In here.
She's having a lie down.
And she's in a bad way, not that you care.
Au contraire, Tanya.
Your daughter's welfare is very close to my heart.
Which is why I've kept schtum about her driving that car last night.
Now, the rest.
I think it's important that we discuss this matter
like responsible parents, don't you?
Nothing to discuss. Relationship's over.
Still, I'd like to apologise for Joey going there in the first place.
I mean, cousins with cousins? Urgh!
I don't want my grandchildren growing up with two heads.
  And I'm sure you don't either, do you?
  Right.
Once Joey's out of Walford, we'll have nothing to worry about.
Why is he hanging around? Eh?
Cos he made it clear how little he thinks of Lauren last night,
we both know how he feels about you! So I want him gone.
Well, I'm sure you do.
The problem is that I think, given a bit more time,
Joey and I could blossom into a very touching father son relationship.
You want to play daddy, go and do it somewhere else.
Yeah, but most of family are here, Tanya,
and I rather like it that way.
I'm even looking for a bigger place  
this is a perfect time to bring Joey back into the fold.
Only he doesn't want to hear that from me.
Which is why I would like you to encourage him.
Give him a nudge.
Why would I do that?
Cos if you don't...
I shall have to retract my statement that I made to the police
backing up Joey's version of events.
And you think they'd believe you, do you? An ex con?
Cos I think if they had Joey's word over yours,
they'd choose his.
And you're prepared to take that gamble, are you?
I'll tell them why Joey lied.
To cover up for his lover.
Then all your dirty sordid little secrets will be aired in public.
And how will Max take that, eh?
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes,
knowing that you condoned this under his very nose.
You'll break his heart.
Maybe I'd rather tell him myself than have you blackmail me.
We'll see.
You just could have been a bit more polite, that's all.
Dad did help last night.
The only person he helped was himself, Alice.
  That's not true. If he hadn't got there...
  Can you stop fussing?
Alice, I'm fine. Lauren's fine.
  How do you know, when you haven't been to the hospital?
  Cos, Alice,
look   I saw Max and Tanya bringing her back earlier.
She wouldn't be home if she weren't OK, would she?
You never said!
We should go over.
Thank you so much for coming round, I'll give her your love,
  tell her you called in.
  It's what families do, ain't it?
Support each other.
  Was there something else?
  Uh, well...
I got this. When I was in there.
I can cut, colour, perm   you name it! So...
  Oh, that's great!
  I was wondering if you had anything going...?
I'm so sorry, Bianca, but I can't take a junior on right now.
You know me, I'm a self starter, I don't need baby sitting, do I?
  What about your old job at the caff?
  Well, um...
Lister's gone and took a court order out.
So, I can't get any work anywhere on the market or Bridge Street.
But, I'm sick of drifting from one dead end job to the next, really.
But it's all right. I'll try somewhere else.
Bianca.
How was prison for you?
How do you mean?
Fine. Once I started my course the days just flew by...
Bet the nights didn't, though, eh?
  What?
  Well, I was on remand, weren't I?
I remember what it was like. The nights. No distractions...
What do you want me to say, that I cried myself to sleep? No, I didn't.
No, you might've felt like it sometimes. You're only human.
You just switch off, don't you?
Yeah? Is that how you handled it?
Yeah. I suppose so.
Not everyone can do that though, can they?
Yeah, I suppose. See you later.
All right, darling, just... Where do you think you're going?
Thought I'd try Joey's mum's. Cos he might be there.
No, no, no, no. Hang on, we've TALKED about all this.
Mum, I need to talk to him,
I need to know what he's feeling for myself.
Darling, no! What you need is some rest. All right?
Have you heard from him at all?
Any texts or calls?
Nothing. Right. Well, doesn't that tell you something?
Yeah, well, you can't keep me here for ever, can you?
And you definitely can't keep us apart.
I mean, I've nothing against Bianca,
but it wasn't even her first offence, was it?
She's like one of them career criminals.
Sorry, I didn't mean to go on.
I only do that when I'm nervous.
Cool, innit. Whatever.
So...you up to much later?
You know. Man's got plans, so...
Oh, you never said. What plans?
Just some stuff with my peoples, you know.
I know a lot of people. Got to spread the love around those peoples, you get me.
Oh, I didn't realise it was... like that.
Yeah, man. That's how I roll, babe.
  I'll see you around then.
  All right.
Um.. What exactly was that?
What you talking about, man? That's Fatboy playing it cool, bruv!
Like, I was cooler than an Eskimo in an icebox, you get me? Come on!
Eskimo in an icebox...
That wasn't cool, that was rude.
You made it sound like you've got a harem on the go.
  No, I didn't!
  Yeah. You did.
Did I?
Here he is.
Big man.
Funny, innit? Cos my daughter's just come out of hospital,
and you're here having a cup of tea. What's that, Joey?
An iced bun. Very nice.
Max, as soon as Alice's ready to go, I'll be out of your life, all right?
Right, and you don't think you owe me an apology?
Or an explanation? That's how you repay me, Joey, is it?
After everything I've done for you?
Your dad's right about you   you're a selfish boy.
You're a very selfish boy, ain't ya, eh?
You don't care about Lauren, do you? You ain't even asked about her!
You've got no idea how much I care, Max.
Come on Max, leave him alone.
How is she?
I don't really need to tell you that, do I?
I know, Joey.
She's told me everything.
If you cared enough to lie for Lauren,
then why did you just walk out?
Just...thought it was for the best, you know.
For everyone.
Yeah. Well, I can't argue with that.
And how do I know you're not going to just change your story,
  and drop her in it?
  You'll have to trust me.
Well, that's a big ask.
  Will it hold? Your statement?
  Yeah.
With or without Derek's backup?
  He said something?
  Will it hold?
There'll be other jobs.
I ain't bothered. I been phoning a few in here anyway. Who needs Tanya?
Look, I better tell you, I'm starting work in the caff next week.
Oh, my old job?
Well, you know, Ian came good.
Lucy needed someone and I thought at least if I'm there it keeps it all in the family.
It don't matter! It's not your fault I burnt my bridges in the caff.
It's OK, you know. To be a bit overwhelmed. You just got back.
I'm fine!
Come here.
I'm not going anywhere. You know that, don't you?
Listen, your mum just needs a little bit of space, darling.
No, no, honestly   I'm fine.
  Why don't me and you go and get an ice cream or something?
  Can I, Gran?
  I suppose. Shouldn't you take him round to see Ray?
  Yes!
Ray can wait. Let me keep him to myself for a while longer first.
You might be able to just up and leave, but I can't do that.
Lauren's not just our friend, she's our COUSIN!
  Where's your family loyalty?
  What about your loyalty to me, eh, Alice?
Have you ever stopped to think about how I might feel in all this?
You didn't see her, Joey. It's not just the cuts and the bruises.
She looks like she's had the stuffing knocked out of her.
I'm sorry, but I can't come with you.
I'll give you a shout when I get settled somewhere.
All right?
Just last night
in the hospital
just for one minute, I thought we'd lost her.
I know. I know. Me too.
But we didn't, did we?
She's OK, she's safe.
But how do we keep her safe?
How do we protect her? She thinks she's all grown up, but she ain't.
I know. I know she does.
But we can.
We can protect her. We will.
I promise.
What you grinning about?
When Alfie Moon gets a challenge, Alfie Moon delivers.
A few of the traders out there put some donations in for me...
Ooh, whoopee di doo. What's that going to get you, some tinsel?
Oi, madam! Ye of little faith!
Got my ace card up my sleeve, ain't I? The Branning brothers.
  What about 'em?
  Well, they're cash rich, ain't they?
They've got a few quid and they'll cough up for me.
Thought I'd get a bit of sibling rivalry going
and the community will reap the rewards, won't they?
Tell you what, sweetheart, leave that here,
I'll make this the best Christmas Walford's ever seen! All right?
Cheer up, it could be worse.
What? You reckon, bruv?
I mean, she ain't even answered her phone! All right?
I swear, I've blown it with a goddess, man!
Mo! You got to stop doing that, all right?
What if I'd thought you was a burglar? And I attacked you by accident, huh?
She'd have been fine, she's got me here to protect her.
Mo, you pop round any time you want, darling.
You're my landlady and I respect that.
  Landlady?
  Yeah.
Mo's decided to rent me the house.
And no   I will not be taking in lodgers.
No, but..
Mo, Mo   Mrs H, I thought we had an agreement!
As you pointed out, it's not in writing.
Cheers.
Market forces, I'm afraid.
But I'll always treasure the nights we shared together.
There you go, Del.
No rush, Fatboy. You got an hour.
See, it actually DID get worse.
Oh! Morgan!
Get in there and wash that ice cream off your hands. Hello? Yes.
Yeah.
Well, like I said in my message,
I've got a certificate.
A reference?
Look, I'm good! Why don't you just take my word for it?
Oh look, just forget it, all right!
Bianca. How about we give it a go, eh?
  The job?
  Seriously?
Just a trial. Come in tomorrow morning and we'll see how we get on.
Oh. Thanks. Mum, did you hear that?
  She's going to give me a go.
  That's great!
You'll be brilliant. Shall we go over to the Vic and celebrate?
To be honest, I think I need a little lay down, if that's all right.
I just needed to see her one last time, you know...
You really do love her, don't you?
Don't really matter now, does it?
It does to me.
Yeah.
Then why did you just dump her like that?
Derek didn't really give me much of a choice, did he?
Right. I see.
Well, I'm not saying that Derek's in the right
but you and Lauren as an item... You must know that could never work?
  Yeah?
  Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm leaving.
I think you should stay. In Walford.
Not in this house   that'll never happen again   but in Walford.
See the thing is, you've had your chance, haven't you,
Just think about it?
I'm not promising to stay for good, only until after Christmas.
You stay as long as you want, my angel, eh?
Why don't you go upstairs and pick a room?
Whatever room you want.
How did you wangle this place, anyway?
I just happened to ask the right person at the right time.
Must be my lucky day.
Why don't I pop out and get us a nice bottle of champagne, eh?
To celebrate? Hmm?
Right. I've... I've asked him to stay in Walford.
That's all I can do.
I had total confidence in your powers of persuasion, Tanya.
Must be what Max kept coming back for, eh?
You've got what you wanted. All right?
You need to promise me you're not going to do anything to hurt Lauren.
You scratched my back, I'll scratch yours.
Derek.
This stays between us, yeah?
