We're off on a journey, to play in the sky,
into the lift, to zoom way up high!
Up at the top are friends that we know,
let's go and meet them, and count as we go!
One elephant exercising.
Two trains chuff chuffing.
Three tigers snoozing.
Four giraffes bathing.
Five snakes sneezing. Atchoo!
Six cars cartwheeling.
Seven hamsters hopping.
Eight monkeys missing.
Peep oh.
Nine jellyfish jiggling.
And...
Ten worms wriggling,
  waving hello!
  Hello!
My wriggly worms want to play the piano.
Show me, show me A singing Chris
La, la, la, la, la!
Show me, show me A drumming Pui
Boom, boom, boom Boom, boom, boom

Let's find out who's ready to play
Chris and Pui and you're here today
Show me, show me All the toys...
There's Mo Mo Bot and Thom and Stuffy,
Miss Mouse and Teddington, is that everybody?
Somebody's missing, but who?
That's right, Tom!
You find your toy, while we find ours!
Tom?
Where are you, Tom?
Tommy, are you up here?
Are you in the house?
No! Where can he be?
Oh! Here he is! I found you!
Show me, show me Some things to do
Lots of fun here for me and you
Show me, show me Some games to play
Let's get ready to play today
Lots to do here for everyone
Show me, show me Let's have some fun!
Wheee!
Somebody wants a Show Me.
Show me, show me music.
Music! When I want to listen to some music, I like to turn on the radio.
Music comes from lots of different places.
I like to listen to music from the computer.
Press a button...
What about a music box?
You wind it up...
Open the box...
And there's beautiful music!
Music can even come from...
a birthday card!
Open it up and listen.
How about that?
Oh, Chris! There's too much music now!
Ooh!
Even the clock's striking... And the wind chimes are rattling!
Silence!
Please!
Oh, that's better.
There's no more music inside,
but listen!
Yes, I can hear music outside.
The birds are singing.
What sort of music do you like?
Show me, show me music.
I like music.
We like music.
I like to dance to any songs.
I like Bhangra music.
I like dancing on my own without any people.
Music makes me jump up and down.
I like singing.
I like very loud music.
I got lullabies. Lullabies...
to make me sleep.
Thank you, you showed me.
And me, and Tom!
And I think Tom would like to play the electric piano.
And it just so happens we have one over here.
Now, the electric piano has a keyboard
with black and white keys. Let's play them.
You press down a key to make a note, a musical note.
They get higher and higher,
or lower and lower and lower.
And if you press the keys together,
you start making music.
I've got a guitar.
You make music on a guitar using the strings.
You can either pluck the strings, like this...
or strum them, like this...
What a lovely sound!
I like playing the drums as well, and we have a drum here.
Let's see what it sounds like.
Join in with the music man!
Imagine you have a musical instrument, and play away!
Let's start with the piano.
I am the music man
I come from down your way And I can play
What can you play?
I play the piano
Pia pia piano Piano, piano
Pia pia piano Pia piano
I am the music man
I come from down your way And I can play
What can you play?
I play the guitar
I am the music man
I come from down your way And I can play
What can you play?
I play the drums!
Oh, that was fun. Are you playing too?
Come on, let's go outside.
Puffs of cloud, high in the sky,
what can you see floating by?
Wellies.
Puffs of cloud, high in the sky,
wonderful things floating by.
What was that? Was that you?
I don't know, it happened when I ruffled my hair.
Let me have a go.
Ha ha!
You have a go too.
I wonder what would happen if I touched my nose.
Ha ha!
You have a go! Ready? One, two, three...
We have musical bodies!
What might happen if we squeeze our tummies very gently? Here goes...
You have a go, ready?
How about if we stick out our bottoms, like this?
Ha ha!
You have a go! One, two, three...
And we could round things off
by playing a drum roll on the floor with our shoes.
Are you ready? One, two, three...
Have a go with us, one, two, three...
Shall we put all the sounds together?
Starting with our hair...
  Nose...
  Bottoms...
Shoes...
And let's round things off with a big crash on the cymbal!
Get cosy and comfy, sit down with your toy,
here comes a tale for us all to enjoy.
One day, Teddington was humming a sort of Teddington song,
"Pom diddly pom diddly pom pom pom,"
when he thought of a rather fabulous plan.
"Wouldn't it be grand if the toys formed a band?" he said.
So off to the music shop they went to try out all the instruments.
"This triangle is a marvellous thing," said Teddington,
as he made it ting.
"A triangle is an interesting shape,
"but I wonder what sound a square would make," giggled Tom.
He looked around for a musical square,
but he couldn't find one anywhere.
"I think I'll play guitar instead," he said.
Strum, strum, strum, strum.
"I like this xylophone a lot, it sounds like bells," said Mo Mo Bot.
Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing!
Stuffy said, "I think I'll hum.
"if that's OK with everyone.
"Hum hmm hmm."
Then little Miss Mouse arrived in a flurry.
"I'm late, I'm ever so sorry!" she squeaked.
"Which instrument would suit a mouse?"
She looked around and sniffed about.
"This shaker would be good for me,
"but it's as heavy as can be,"
said Miss Mouse.
She tried the recorder, she huffed and puffed,
but she couldn't quite blow hard enough.
She jumped on the piano with all her might,
but she couldn't make a sound, she was far too light.
"Why don't you hum along with me?
"It makes your throat feel wobbly," said Stuffy.
Miss Mouse said, "I'll try."
But my, oh, my, she was quieter than a buzzing fly.
"I know," said Teddington,
"Why don't you try playing a drum? It might be fun."
"But it's bigger than she is," said Toddler Tom.
"I'm far too small to lift the sticks,
"but I might be able to play it like this," said Miss Mouse.
And up she climbed onto the drum.
Then she started to tap dance. Ta rum tum tum.
It sounded very loud indeed,
and the rhythm was catchy as can be.
"That's fabulous," said Teddington,
"I think we all should play along."
So they all joined in
with a strum and a ting
and a bing and a hum
and a rum tum tum tum tum tum tum.
And even though Miss Mouse was small,
she made the loudest sound of all.
Miss Mouse, well done. You really were very loud.
What was that? It sounded like thunder.
Let's go outside.
No, it can't be   it's sunny outside.
Chris! It's you!
This makes a huge sound. It's a kettle drum.
I hear thunder, I hear thunder
Hark, don't you? Hark, don't you?
Pitter patter raindrops Pitter patter raindrops
  I'm wet through
  So are you.
Ooh! Chris, it's sunny outside and we're singing about rain.
Yes, but sometimes when you get sunshine after rain,
you get a rainbow!
Did you hear that? Someone wants a Show Me.
Show me, show me rainbows.
Rainbows! I've got a picture of a rainbow over here.
Let me show it to you.
It stretches across the sky.
It's made up of loads of colours.
I can see red and yellow.
This is my rainbow stick.
It's got lots of colours   red, orange, yellow,
green and lots of blues.
Hey, little rainbow How do you do?
How do you do all the things that you do?
How do you make your colours so bright?
Tell me how, tell me now Tell me do
My ribbon is blue as a blueberry
A sunny sky and a swim in the sea
Hey, little rainbow How do you do...
Do you do all the things that you do?
Hey, little rainbow How do you do...
How do you do all the things that you do?
How do you make your colours so bright?
Tell me how, tell me now Tell me do
Your ribbon is as green as leaves on trees
Garden grass and mushy peas
Hey, little rainbow How do you do...
Do you do all the things that you do?
Hey, little rainbow How do you do...
How do you do all the things that you do?
How do you make your colours so bright?
Tell me how, tell me now Tell me do
My ribbon is as red as tomatoes
A bright red bus and a clown's red nose
Hey, little rainbow How do you do...
Do you do all the things that you do?
Show me, show me, Penelope.
Hello, everyone, it's a lovely day.
How do you have fun on a sunny day?
Penelope, how do you have fun?
I found a butterfly! Wait, wait!
Ah! Ooh...
Huh? Ah! I found a ladybird!
Where? Where? Where did it go?
Where did the ladybird go?
Huh? Oops, it's tickling me.
Who is it? Who's tickling my forehead.
Woof!
Yippee! A birdie!
Wait, wait for me!
Wow! It's sparkling!
Catching insects, running in the field,
going on a swing, everything you do is fun on a sunny day,
isn't it, Penelope?
How do you have fun on a windy day?
Penelope, how do you have fun?
Ooh, what a strong wind!
Ah! Leaves are dancing around in a circle!
They're going round and round!
Dad! What are you holding?
Guess what spins around on a windy day, Penelope.
What? Let me see...
  Leaves?
  Ha ha, no!
Look! It's a windmill!
A windmill! It's spinning!
And this is a kite.
A kite?
Yippee! A kite, a kite!
A windy day is great fun, isn't it?
How do you have fun when it pours with rain?
Penelope, how do you have fun?
Wow!
Pretty! A spider's web!
It looks like Mum's necklace.
Huh? Snails!
The big one is the mummy snail. The small one is the baby snail.
Yes! I know what I can do!
Oh, Penelope? What are you going to do?
I will become a snail too!
That's right   you play inside on a rainy day.
Drawing pictures, playing with blocks,
and looking at picture books are fun, too.
Oh, the rain is getting harder.
There was a flash in the sky.
What's happening?
It's thunder.
Aaaagh!
Penelope?
Mummy!
Don't worry, darling. The thunder will go away soon.
Really?
Yes, I promise.
Wow! A rainbow!
It's beautiful!
  It is!
  Beautiful!
A sunny day, a windy day,
or a rainy day. Which weather do you like?
Thank you, Penelope, you showed me.
So, Mo Mo Bot likes the red ribbon, the orange, the yellow, the green...
You like all the colours, don't you?
But I think she likes blue best.
You think so? Hmm...
You know what that means!
  Show me, show me your groovy moves...
  Come and have a dance!
Freeze!
Teddington, you moved!
Ooh, there's the lift!
I wonder who's coming up. I'd better set up the shop.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten!
Shop's open!
It's the Hey Diddle Cow!
Hello! How lucky you are to see me again!
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,
the cow jumped over the moon.
The little dog laughed to see such fun
and the dish ran away with the spoon.
How can I help you?
I wonder if you can help me, shopkeeper.
I love the colour brown, but I'd like to be a different colour.
I'll see what I've got.
How exciting!
How about red?
Well, I do like the colour red,
but it reminds me of the red hot sun,
and it makes me feel...
Hot?
Yes.
Um, how about...blue?
I do like the colour blue, but it reminds me of the cold, blue sea.
It makes me feel...
Cold?
No, sick. Seasick.
Oh. How about yellow?
I do like yellow...
  Or orange?
  I like orange.
  Violet?
  I like violet as well. Oh dear!
Oh dear! I like green and violet...
I like all the colours. Oh dear, oh dear!
Don't worry, Hey Diddle Cow.
Seeing as you love all the colours,
I have just the thing!
How exciting! How exciting!
Look!
It's got all the colours!
Oh, I love it! I love it!
Why don't you try it on?
Oh, yes, please!
That tickles!
  Do you like it?
  Yes!
  Will the little dog laugh?
  I hope so!
I'm so excited I could jump over the moon!
Seeing as you're now multi coloured, instead of jumping over the moon,
why don't you jump over the rainbow?
Ooh! Yes.
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,
over the rainbow jumped cow.
Wheee! Did the little dog laugh? Did he?
Oh, yes. The little dog laughed to see such fun,
  and the dish and the spoon shouted...
  Wow!
What a colourful day we're having!
And the toys are dressed in the colours of the rainbow.
Look at Miss Mouse's little red scarf, aw.
And, Stuffy, you're bound to be noticed in that hat!
What about Teddington? He is wearing so many colours!
He has a red hat, a green bow tie,
an orange waistcoat, with yellow handkerchief,
blue socks and purple shoes.
Red and orange and yellow and green
Yellow and green, yellow and green
Red and orange and yellow and green Blue socks and purple shoes.
  Teddington, you're a musical rainbow.
  Musical rainbow!
Say "musical rainbow" to your toy today.
Oh, there's the lift!
It's time for us to go.
Be sure to come and see us again soon, we love having you here.
Get your worms ready!
