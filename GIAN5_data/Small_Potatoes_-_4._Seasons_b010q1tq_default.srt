Small potatoes, small potatoes small potatoes, small potatoes
  Oh, potatoes
  On the moon, ba boom boom
  Small potatoes in the sea
  Ba doom doom
Small potatoes take a bath Small potatoes sing with me
Potatoes
Small potatoes, small potatoes small potatoes
Small potatoes.
I like the summer because I can go to the beach
and swim in the sea and play ping pong.
Seasons, seasons, seasons
In the winter there is snow Soft and white wherever you go
  We make snowmen
  We ride a sleigh
We are chilly but we like it that way
In the springtime the birds appear
And that means the flowers will be here
  We have picnics
  We ride a bike
Spring is full of things that we like
Seasons, seasons, seasons
In the summer we like the beaches And we like the juicy summer peaches
  We ride skateboards
  We fly our kites
We relax on sleepy summer nights
In the fall, the leaves turn brown
And we jump in piles that are on the ground
  We catch a glow worm
  Inside a jar
We look up and we see a shooting star
Seasons, seasons, seasons
Seasons, seasons, seasons.
The type of snowmen I make are the big ones.
The have a big snowball for their legs,
a medium snowball for their body and a small snowball for their head.
And they have stones as their eyes and mouth
and carrots for their noses,
and they have scarves, hats and gloves, and twigs for arms.
And it's really fun making snowmen with your friends.
