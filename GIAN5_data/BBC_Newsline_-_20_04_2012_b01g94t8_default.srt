Welcome to BBC Newsline. The headlines: The couple who stole
�100,000 from a pensioner suffering from Alzheimer's. The former bank
money. Moore gloom for the motorist as
petrol prices here continues to rise.
It is Brian McLoughlin's last game in charge at Ravenhill. Can the
Ulster players give their coach the perfect send off against Leinster?
Today we have had warm spells of sunshine interspersed with claps of
thunder so what has the weekend in store? Join me later.
A couple from Warrenpoint have admitted stealing almost �100,000
from an elderly widow suffering from Alzheimer's. James and Colleen
McPolin drove their 84 year old victim to her building society to
get her to hand over the money. This is the couple who preyed on a
vulnerable old woman. 41 year old colleague and a taxi driver husband,
46 year old James, both from Warrenpoint. They befriended at
childless widow, Beatrice. In May 2009, they took the 84 year old to
this building society in Newry where she made them out a cheque
for �46,000. Eight months later, she was back for a cheque for
�50,000. At this point, staff became suspicious and called the
police. At the time of the offences, the doctors said she was no longer
capable of looking after her affairs. They took advantage of her
ill state and that is what constituted the theft. When the
full extent of her dementia emerged during a police investigation, a
High Court gave him complete control over her affairs. This lady
was the most honourable and disadvantaged person, given the
extent of her Alzheimer's condition. She has no capacity to understand
what is going on on a day to day basis. A rethink of crimes against
the elderly and the vulnerable in our society, we think of a physical
assault and robbery. However, this particular case was no less serious,
it was perpetrated in a very callous manner and have the
potential to defraud and 87 year  old lady of her life savings.
couple have remortgaged their home to raise the money they took from a
pensioner. Today in court, they handed over a cheque for � 45,000
and that means they have paid back all the money they stole. The judge
said he would be passing sentence at next week after that cheque has
cleared. A former bank worker has been
jailed for eight months for stealing more than �20,000 from two
of his former colleagues. Stephen Glenn from Newtownards admitted two
counts of theft and forgery. Glenn told them he was going to invest
the money but instead he spent it. His ex wife says she believes that
other people who gave him money are still to come forward. She's been
talking to our district journalist, Claire Savage.
This is Stephen Glenn outside a Swiss bank in Monaco. He had a
taste for the high life but are paid for it with other people's
money. Five years ago he told his victims he would invest their money
but today he was jailed for pocketing it. During this time he
was bankrupt but kept ahead and this fact from his wife at the time.
She doesn't want to be identified to protect their children but says
other people may have been fooled. There is definitely other victims
out there, I know that there fact. I cannot give any names and I guess
some people are too afraid to come forward and say they are victims.
When Stephen was a bankrupt, he may just damage to the south of France.
He said it was for business but later said there were threats
against him. His wife came back to Northern Ireland at the end of 2007
and found unpaid bills and a repossession order for their house.
A I can still remember the feeling, I thought I was going to faint but
I was so shocked and horrified, I didn't know where to begin to start
to peace my life back together again because it had just gone from
this idyllic life of living in the south of France in a wonderful do
love with a swimming pool and everything seemed so good. To then
come back and realise there had been such deception going on behind
my back and to realise my own home was being taken from me, it was
horrific. She says he has damaged people's lives. I hope that my ex
husband will recognise the extent of the devastation he has cost. He
has never shown any signs of being remorseful or made any attempts to
apologise. I think he lacks the high life and he likes of the rich
living. He always liked the film, catch me if you can. In some ways,
he has modelled his life in the past few years on the main
character in that film. Before he was sentenced, he told me he had
been the victim of an international scam and that he had been working
with the FBI to help smash it, something security sources have
rubbished. Today the judge said it would be in the public interest if
Stephen Glenn spent at least eight months of his 16 months sentence in
prison. A rare sentence for someone with a clean record.
UK petrol prices may have risen to a new high today but the cost at
the pumps here is even higher. The average price per litre of petrol
is now �1.44. Diesel costs even more with a further price rise to
come for both in the autumn. Many motorists have no alternative but
to pay more for fuel. There may be big price cuts at the
forecourts but they are in the shops, not the pumps were the price
of fuel continues to rise. Brittle has reached an UK high of �142.88
and later on average and here we pay 1.5 pence more. With household
incomes squeezed by inflation, pay freezes and benefit cuts, it means
filling up the car is now an necessary evil. It is 2 p a litre
more than last week but most of that his tax. It used to be �30 to
fill the car but now it is �70. you drive a diesel, you cannot feel
the pain. It is much more expensive than their petrol. Where you are
really going to see the difference is if you go abroad. Northern
Ireland now has the second highest diesel prices in Europe. Only
Norway is more expensive. There are alternatives, the main one being
public transport. That is OK if you live in a town or city but for
those living in the countryside, it is sometimes not an option to.
live in an area where there is not a great deal of competition, there
may be is not a supermarket in your area at driving the price down and
you're paying the highest prices for petrol and diesel in the UK and
in Europe and you have no alternative but to use public
transport. That is the position of people living along the border find
themselves in the Ikea in County Tyrone. I could spend �one and 50 a
week on diesel, is a disgrace. is very, very expensive for us.
you saying    spending more? Definitely, yes. At a saving of
around �12 on the if the love of tank, it is not attractive as it
once was. Government duty mix up the bulk of what we pay. There is
another increase coming in August. Next week, the Assembly debates and
motion calling for the devolution to set fuel for duty. That might
ease the turning of the screw on the motorist.

The Ulster Hospital in Dundonald says 40 of its staff had been moved
from administration buildings during a gas leak this afternoon.
It happened after contractor ruptured a gas main on the west
side of the hospital complex near the renal unit. Staff reported
hearing hissing noises earlier today but no patients were affected.
Phoenix Gas engineers and the fire service cut off the gas supply at
the mains while the leak dissipated. Still to come on the programme:
They were promised a piece of paradise. Instead they got disaster
but today they got their money back. Now it is just, all my goodness!
This is a future for our family again.
We meet the Armoy woman who is hoping to paddle her way to the
London Olympics. The 120 year old Athletic Stores
building in the centre of Belfast is to be demolished to make way for
an apartment block. Campaigners say they are annoyed that not enough
was done to save the building. The Victorian building has stood at
the corner of Queen Street for more than a century. It survived the
Blitz and the IRA's bombing campaign of the Seventies and
Eighties but it is developers who will end up pulling it down. After
years of controversy, the Environment Minister has finally
granted planning approval for the building to be demolished. Nobody
really believed the building could be saved. The issue is, cannot but
the sad be saved? When you look at the cost of doing so, the better
judgment, hard though it was, is that the building to be demolished
or stop in its place, there will be a seven storey block of apartments
and a row of shop at street level but conservationists insist the
ornate front could have been saved. We think it makes sense. It is
fundamental to the character of this conservation area and to lose
buildings like this, we use our links with the past and identity
and we lose that authentic, tangible link with industrial
heritage of Belfast on which we sell ourselves to tourists in
particular. We cannot afford to lose buildings like this any more.
The building had not been given special protection and was not
listed. Today's decision means Belfast is poised to lose another
of its victory in buildings but before the demolition squad moves
in, the developer will have to raise the cash necessary to carry
out its plans and that won't be easy in today's property market.
There was traffic disruption in Belfast city centre earlier today
when metro bus drivers went on strike. Dozens of drivers stopped
work in support of a colleague who had been disciplined by Translink
management. The action lasted around 90 minutes. Services resumed
when the union heard the driver had been reinstated on full pay.
Management and unions will meet on Monday. The strike led to confusion
at bus stops and long queues at taxi ranks.
It is uncomfortable for everyone and people will be disappointed but
people need to look at where the blame is. Do not put the blame on
the workforce. They supported their colleague because it could happen
to them. Three people from Northern Ireland
whose dream of owning a holiday home in Italy turned to disaster
have got their money back after five years. They handed over
thousands of pounds for a deposit on apartment that was never built.
They sued the solicitor who did the conveyancing work and today they
got the result they wanted. They were promised a piece of paradise.
The kids, this will be our beach. Instead, they had a devastating
disappointment. This couple from East Belfast board an apartment off
plant in southern Italy. Despite doing plenty of research, they
found themselves thousands of pounds out of pocket. A lawyer took
their deposit but the holiday homes were never constructed. They sued
the Italian solicitor and today at a High Court, the case was settled
in their favour. You put something to the back of your mind and don't
allow yourself to think about it because you cannot think of the
reality of this not coming to fruition and now is just, on my
goodness, this is a future for our family again. It is nice to get the
justice. The money comes into it obviously but it was in black and
white. The scheme was well marketed in Northern Ireland. The lawyer in
Italy appeared to have good credentials but the buyers were
badly let down. He sent the money on to the estate agents and didn't
carry out any of the proper checks. The land itself was designated for
agricultural purposes only so nothing could ever be built there.
Robert Crawford from County Down also won damages. Until you get
there, anything could happen. It has been a tough time and I am glad
to see the back of it, to be honest. So they have finally got the money
back but many others are still waiting. More than 60 people from
Northern Ireland who bought holiday homes are also suing the Italian
lawyer. Ireland's boxing team for the
London 2012 games is nearly finalised. Today Adam Nolan booked
his ticket in the welterweight division. Paddy Barnes is already
London bound but he had a controversial defeat today.
With qualification assured, the pressure was off paddy Barnes to
win his semi final but today. That didn't stop him a landing hard
punches on his Turkish opponent but surprisingly the judges ruled in
favour of the home fighter Bostock the result frustrated him but
another Olympic hopeful but he doesn't think he will have any
trouble when the Games come around. I don't think it will matter, the
experience will stand by him. London doesn't throw any secrets up,
he knows what it is all about so fingers crossed he could go better
this time. The day started well for the Irish boxing team when Adam
Nolan became the 5th fighter to qualify for the Games. But there
was heartbreak for Tommy McCarthy, he lost his semi final with and the
last hour and with that, his chance of an Olympic place.
The Olympic qualification deadlines are not confined to boxing at this
time of year. With 98 days to the game's opening ceremony, this
evening we profile a County Antrim woman who is hoping to paddle her
way to London 2012. When it comes to an water sports,
Pamela's background is hardly typical. She was raised on a ship
San    sheep farm in Armoy. Her family moved to France when she was
nine and she developed a passion for canoe slalom. There's little
room for error. It can be a lonely sport. Sometimes the only training
partner you have is a duck or swamp. But this is constant challenges, it
is the combination of a thrill and skill but I have never found in any
other sport. And she is good at it. In a sport that often the struggles
for exposure and funding, Hannah and her fellow hopefuls have had to
work particularly hard. She has a brilliant chance of qualifying, I
think it would be great for the sport. It is important now a
because the sports are really vying for each other for funding because
funding is going down for all sports and if you can show that you
are qualifying people for the Olympic Games, it gives the sport
much better chance of getting funding. Olympic qualification
hinges on next man's European championships in Germany. A big
performance there would Secure Hanna a picture in the summer.
It is Ulster's penultimate game in rugby's pro 12 this evening, which
they must win to keep their play  off hopes intact. Leinster are the
visitors for what will also be Brian McLoughlin's last match at
Ravenhill as Ulster head coach. Live now to Gavin Andrews.
A BIC atmosphere building here at Ravenhill ahead of the start a.
Some of the stories of Irish rugby are on a store and one joins us now.
It is no indication of Ulster's success at the tail end of this
season but you are being rested tonight for a game so big? It shows
what a good squad we have. We can tick players like Stephen Ferris
and Dan Tuohy and myself that are carrying bumps and bruises and make
sure we are right for next week. Wigan have no fear of the boys
coming in because we know they would be a cracking job. We are
going to see Brian O'Driscoll out there for Leinster? It is a good
sign that leads to feel they have to bring a strong side appear.
They're at home, is a big game with two very strong teams out and it
should be a cracking game of rugby. A couple of the South Africans will
be playing at their last game had given Hill and Brian McLaughlan?
Over the last number of years we have had a few people playing their
last games at Ravenhill. Obviously it will be a sad day for this
evidence but a particularly sad day for Brian Haw. But it is a good day
for him as well, I am sure the boys will bring in a performance for him.
He has done a fantastically well for us but it is always a little
bit special when it is somebody from within Ulster and everyone is
very thankful for the job he has done and hopefully we can give him
a good scent of tonight and again next week. Best of luck, enjoy and
to keep calm. There is live coverage over on BBC Two from 7pm.
In football, the Irish Premiership title may already be decided but
the relegation battle is still intense. Carrick Rangers will go
down if they fail to beat Lisburn Distillery tonight. Glenavon are
not mathematically safe yet either, although their 4 0 win here over
Donegal Celtic last week has boosted their survival prospects.
We have done the first part of our job but the most important part of
our job is to not into any relegation fight and we don't want
to be in a play off situation. We want to get to the end having a
winner. It will not be easy at Ballymoney. I am confident that if
we play there will be have been playing and tighten up the back, we
can get a result against anybody in the league.
Gaelic football   Armagh and Crossmaglen goalkeeper Paul Hearty
has announced his retirement from Inter county football. He began his
Armagh career 12 years ago and was understudy to Benny Tierney during
their All Ireland triumph in 2002. Fancy yourself as the next Gordon
Ramsay or Jamie Oliver? Then get along to the north west this
weekend where the focus is on fabulous food. Hundreds have signed
up for special cookery demonstrations tomorrow but today
it was the turn of the Junior masterchefs to showcase their
talent. The former army parade grounds at
Ebrington is playing host to a special event. Today, budding young
cooks were up against each other in a masterchefs attack competition.
They all have come through college's degree course but this
was a very public challenge where the heat was on. I am doing a pan 
fried salmon with oven baked potatoes and and lemon dressing for
some salad. My granny and my parents both love cooking so any
time anybody comes, there is something ready in the oven or any
recipe to try out. He is hoped this will have a positive impact on what
people put on the dining tables. is so important to get young people
thinking about a healthy lifestyle. The competition judge was certainly
are to get into cooking because it teaches them discipline, it teaches
them to have passion for something oh stop it is great to see them
getting excited about something that is not on a screen. So, to the
winner, this 13 year old from foil and Londonderry College. I grew up
with cooking will stop my mum and my sister influenced me and I'm so
passionate about kicking. The focus on third continues throughout the
weekend. The last couple of days, the storms
have avoided as but today we had higher temperatures and in the
sunshine, tender just got up to 14 degrees. The dealer shows the
picture, a lot of sunshine around but in the afternoon, this area of
cloud kicked off with some heavy showers. There was some lightning
reports around and we got this picture in the Cookstown area. It
has been one of those days, the air goes up and you get at Anderston,
those shares could reach Ravenhill in the next few yards but the rain
is beginning to die away and the emphasis will be on dry, clear
weather. It would be as cold tonight. Not the frost we had last
night. It does mean the weekend will start of a rather damp and
cloudy. The shares could be quite lengthy as well so it is a very
much an East, West divide. It is with ticking an umbrella if you go
out tomorrow. The further west you are, the drier and sunnier it will
be. It will feel very pleasant and those sunny skies will head
eastwards so that most places will have a decent end to the day and a
nice Saturday evening. On Sunday, it will start of a sunny but the
