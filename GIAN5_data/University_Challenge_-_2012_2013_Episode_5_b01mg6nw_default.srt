Asking the questions, Jeremy Paxman!
Hello.
Ahead of us, another 30 minutes of intellectual shove ha'penny
as two teams of students attempt to prove themselves worthy
of a place in the second round.
The losers could also qualify to play again
if their score is good enough.
Queen Mary became a part of the University of London in 1915
but began life in 1887 as the People's Palace,
a philanthropic centre for East Londoners
which combined educational, cultural and leisure opportunities,
until it was decided that leisure was getting in the way
of everything else and had to be stopped.
It's the result of mergers between four colleges,
and now has three faculties,
of which two are devoted to the sciences,
including Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry.
Alumni include the cricketer WG Grace
and the authors Sarah Waters and JG Ballard,
as well as Graham Chapman of Monty Python fame, and the rarely seen
man of mystery, the voice of University Challenge, Roger Tilling.
Representing around 17,000 students and with an average age of 25,
let's meet the Queen Mary team.
Hi, I'm Patrick Woodburn, I'm originally from Woldingham,
in Surrey, and I'm studying medicine.
Hello, I'm Alistair Haigh, from Harrogate in North Yorkshire,
and I'm studying biology and psychology.

Hello, I'm Luca Cavalli from South London,
and I'm studying a Masters in physics.
Hello, I'm Michael Hammond, I'm from North London,
and I'm studying history.
Jesus College, Oxford was founded by Elizabeth I in 1571
and is the only Oxford college to date from her reign.
A driving force behind its establishment
was a wealthy churchman, Hugh Price,
and its original aim was the education of future clergyman.
It's known as the Welsh college,
and up until 1915 it had an almost unbroken succession of principals
who either came from Wales or were of Welsh descent.
One of the college's traditions is the Turl Street Dash,
a fancy dress bike race which Jesus always wins by conveniently
forgetting to invite any other colleges to take part.
Tonight's four represent around 470 fellow students,
and as the oldest of them is only 21, they weren't even born
when their college last won this series in 1986.
Let's meet them.
Hi, I'm Matt Hitchings, I'm from London,
and I'm reading for a Masters in Mathematical Modelling.

Hello, I'm Guy Brindley, I'm from Worcestershire,
and I'm reading Classics.

and I'm studying Engineering.
