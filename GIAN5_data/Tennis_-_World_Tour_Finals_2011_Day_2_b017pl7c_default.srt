With just minutes to go before Andy Murray embarks on the last
been a memorable season for the Scot. Title secured across three
continents. A brilliant win for Andy Murray. He is the champion at
Queen's Club again. Grandstand semi finals reached, the set that
man ever to achieve the feat of four. His current world ranking is
three, should he maintain it will be his best ever. Naughty boy!
Masters 1,000 series wins, equalling his best ever. One. Grand
Slam final, though it ended in disappointment. Hopefully there is
belief that he will come back again and have his day. His run at the
Australian Open set a standard 40,011. Andy has never won tennis'
end of season and Ali, but a victory this week could be a launch
He will have plenty of support here, and while the talk is always about
whether he can win a Grand Slam or not, this event is the next best
thing. Welcome to date two of the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals and
we are set for Andy Murray's opening match against and   
against David Farrar. 10 and Andrew are with me a game, as the build up
starts behind us    Tim Henman and Andrew are with me. It has been a
terrific year for Andy Murray. Although he has not won a Grand
Slam. For me, it has been his best year. I think he agrees with that.
It is one of these moments when we should focus on what he was able to
achieve, not what he was not able to achieve. He has won five
tournaments, two Masters 1,000 events. When you look in the
context of how many players have done this in a calendar year, it is
only seven. It is a phenomenal achievement, but he wants more than
that. I think next year he can and will win one forced on we think he
can because he beats the top players on a break in the basis.
Nadal got in the way this year. The 4th game of the second set in the
Wimbledon semi final, he missed that forehand, 15 30, and in the
commentary box and the crowd, everybody went, oh, it was so
surprising. He was on the way and it slipped after that miss. He is
in esteemed company, he talks about it all the time, it is not an
excuse, it is a great era of tennis. Djokovic elevated himself this year,
can Andy Murray do that next it? I think he can. I think Federer still
has more to give, but it is captivating at the top of the game.
Federer has been the man in form in recent weeks. Let's look at the
group's as they stand at the moment. This is what we are concentrating
on today. First up, Andy Murray against David Ferrer. Also on the
HD Channel this evening, Novak Djokovic against Tomas Berdych.
Group B were in action yesterday, Federer the Dow of    of Federer
and Nadal were involved in two marathons here. We can show you a
bit of what happened in Nadal against Fish, Nadal raced away with
the opening set but Fish fought back well, big serves in the second
set and he took it by six games to The match level at one set all.
Fish was proving a problem on court, but he was proving a problem off
court as well because Nadal had to leave the court, he said he had
salmon pasta that did not agree with him and had to have a bathroom
break. He then lost three games in a row to go a break down in the
final set but he fought back, as you would expect Rafael Nadal to
always do, and he won it 7 points to 3 in the final set. It was an
immense battle, wasn't it, for Rafa yesterday? Very much so, he had not
played a great deal of tennis coming into this event, and it is
different here because of the round robin format. You can lose in
the first match and still go through to the semi finals but if
you get that first win under your belt, it sets you up and his nest  
  and his next match will be great to see. Federer was not at his best
yesterday, either. He won the first set, Tsonga was nowhere, it was a
mirror image in the second set, and then Tsonga made some mistakes in
the last service game. Double fault, a missed volley. Then he lost the
match. Federer is a man of substance, though, and knows how to
win matches, so does Nadal. For the sake of the tournament, I was
pleased to see them both win even the Fish and Tsonga did well.
two great champions came through yesterday and this is the match we
are looking forward to now, Andy Murray at the back up against David
Ferrer. Andy Murray has won the three matches they have played in
2011. Now we get the walk from the locker rooms. This really is
showbiz, it is so different from any tournament around the world.
certainly is, but the atmosphere is building and they will be looking
forward to getting out there. They have had enough time practising,
they want to get on the court and get going. The only thing missing
from David Ferrer is a hard hat, because he is an absolute grinder,
it is a good match to start with for Murray, but he will have to get
the patience and aggression sorted out. OK, we are just about to hear
Ladies and gentlemen, three time Grand Slam finalist and winner of
five ATP World Tour singles titles in 2011, the British number one and
A lovely moment, one she will cherish for a while! The players
are on court. This is a magnificent arena for tennis, isn't it? It is
incredible to have 17,500 capacity, there is not a bad seed in the
house. So much focus on Wimbledon in the summer, and this really
fills a gap so that people can get their fill of tennis in the
wintertime. It is the third year it has been here at the O2 Arena, I
think there are a few more years to go, let's hope it can stay after
that. Andy Murray leads this arena, he loves this surface, loves being
indoors and played so well last year. There is nothing he likes
more than to feel a tennis match is gladiatorial. He spent a lot of
time with boxers over the years, and this atmosphere is very much
that one on one, one man against another on the stage. It suits him,
there are no variables, the lighting is superb, the courts are
a nice, even pace. It is ideal for just about everybody. He would
rather it was on the red clay but it is not. The only time David
Ferrer has beaten Murray is on clay, not on anything else. But Murray
has been in awesome form recently as well. He has had a tremendous
end to the year. He has had a lot of great wins coming in, the three
tournaments in Asia. Whoever wins this point us can choose to serve,
they can choose this side, that side, but all of the pressure is on
the person flipping the point. David, if you could call heads or
tails? Heads. It is a tale. Andy? Receive? Pretty standard for Andy
Murray to elect to receive. obviously fancies getting an early
break of serve. That is the picture, Andy Murray is
keen to get on with it, as you can expect, because the opening matches
are always a bit nerve racking. As we talk about Murray and his record,
we look back on it, he has done so well, hasn't he? He has had another
great year, two ATP Masters 1,000 Series titles. Shanghai was the
third of the three victories that he got in a row in Asia. That is a
very strong effort, winning three tournaments in a row. Grand Slam
record, or semi finals, he is a Pat world number three, only 24 years
of age. His best years may be now     he is up at world number three.
The trouble is the standard continues to rise. He is ready to
achieve great things, I really believe that. The beauty of this
tournament for us, but the hard part for the players, is normally
in a regular tournament you have a couple of matches before you come
up against a senior player. First match out, he is playing world
number five, and it emphasises the point that you have to hit the
ground running, there is no way to feel your way in, get used to the
conditions, the balls, the court. You have to play your best tennis
from the word go, and they appreciate that and it will be
interesting to see who does that. The warm up has some time to go,
let's hear from Andy Murray a couple of days ago, looking back at
his incredible so even. I think it has been my best here,  
  his incredible season. Even moving up 1 spot in the rankings,
it is good to see that you are making progress. I played well in
the majors, still improvements to make, that is what is exciting for
me. If I felt it was going backwards, that is when you start
to worry, but I have a lot of improving to do. A lot of players
this year, especially, have had their best years at 26, 27 years
old, so that is a good sign for me that there is still a lot of
improving today. Scenario, you get a time machine for Christmas back
and taking to an era when a dark, Federer and Djokovic do not exist,
so you are a number one, a multiple major champion, but not as good a
player because you are not been tested week in, week out. Do you
take the trip or stay where you are? I would probably rather stay
here. I think it is probably the most competitive era in tennis, I
have had the chance to compete against Federer and Nadal, the two
best rivals I have ever played, no question, and Djokovic has had,
before this year, people would not have been putting him in that
bracket. But anything can happen in sport, and he has played an
incredible season and it has tested me, made me need to get fitter and
stronger and kind of be resilient and keep coming back. I have had a
lot of tough losses, big events, but I keep working hard, trying to
get much ultimate goals and I am getting closer, and that is what is
exciting. But because I have been around those guys it has made me a
better tennis player. I have managed to win against each of them
many times, and I would like to have some more opportunities in
getting the chance against them, which is a privilege. I would hope
that most competitors in the situation that I'm in would want to
do the same day. Have a fantastic He is in such a tough era, but this
is the match today against Davide Ferrere, where Andy Murray holds
five wins in    five wins against three, and he has won the last four
against Arab. You wonder how Ferrer can hurt Murray    the last four
against David Farrar. I think coming into this environment, Andy
playing at home on a hard court, it points in Murray's favour, but
again, actions speak louder than words. Murray has got to come out
and play well, and it he does not, you know that Farrow will not give
up, he will compete hard    Davide Ferrere. As far as Murray, I was
reading an article by Boris Becker where he was saying his first serve
percentage has got to improve, he has to improve his position in on
court? All of these things, they are highlighted when they are not
working well. When Murray gets the balance right between aggressive
from the baseline and still not making unforced errors, that is
when he plays well, but those are all dictated by his mentality, his
mental approach on the court. When he can be focused on his game plan,
the style he needs to play, he is one of the best and can only get
better. When, in the Australian Open final, he got distracted after
losing the first set to Djokovic, he had that running commentary with
his player box, that is when he came unstuck, but if he can
maintain that focus then there are bit things ahead. His supporters
are all caught sight watching, hoping he will make a good start
here at the finals. As far as the serve is concerned, technically it
is very good, isn't it? I think a little bit for me is dictated by
his ball toss, when it gets too far in front he loses elevation and the
margin for error goes down. When he is further back, momentum is going
up, that is what you want. You look at someone like Federer, Roddick,
great servers, their momentum is going up, they get huge elevation
and Murray, when he serves like that, serves comfortably and it
puts pressure on his opponent and his return game is probably the
best in the world. Sir definitely his serving can dictate a lot of
aspects to his game. We see this every year when it comes to a
round robin situation. They are not easy, so different from a
tournament when it is win or lose. Very much so, I don't think it
necessarily changes your mind set because you are focused on your
game plan, you want to win the match, but in the back of your mind,
perhaps, if you have a loss in this format you can say, I am still
alive, I need to win the next two matches and I can still get to the
semi finals. But you are starting off against another player right at
the top of their game and you have got to be ready to gowns. I know it
is drawn out, but I am sure Murray is delighted to be facing Davide
Ferrere first rather than Berdych? As is a, I think in terms of the
best scenario, this is it, it will give him the opportunity to go out
there and find his rhythm, but he will know he has to produce a good
performer. The warm up is over, they are about
to go out to play, so I will send Tim to the commentary box, Andy is
already there. Thank you. It is interesting
talking about David Ferrer. He said, you don't get ranked by talent, you
get ranked by result. He knows he may not be the best player in the
world but he knows how to get the best out of his game and knows he
Davide Ferrere's coach in the middle there. He once locked him in
I should explain that! It was a form of discipline, it is the sort
of relationship they have got. Ferrer will be the work, he has
moulded Ferrer into the world No. 5, a world class operator of many
years. He does not need praise, he says of Ferrer, he just needs a
critique, he just wants to get better. He is No. 5 in the world
but wants to know how to get to A good opener for the Spanish
player, a good settling game, 1 0. He is a worker. You have got
somebody like Ferrer down the other end. A few years ago was there
another Ferrer type player in your generation? Who was around in your
day? He is the typical Spanish player. You talk about success for
David Ferrer, and I think that is about maximising your potential.
Can I see him breaking into the top four? I just don't see it. Those
guys have separated themselves, and Ferrer, I think, is maximising his
potential, getting the most out of his game, and perhaps has to wait
to see if somebody gets injured. He will have to see whether he will
get an opportunity to get higher You have got to love watching Andy
Murray played. He has more changes of spins and directions, more
changes of elevation over the net and changes of pace, than anybody
else. He really does throw every sort of look at an opponent and it
He can certainly break his opponent's rhythm but sometimes
when he gets the shot selection wrong he can break his own rhythm.
It is a nice problem to have when you have got the assets on the
court, you just have to make sure Did that serve finish the game? I
think Murray might finish this one is out as well, he is preparing to
hit a second serve, but hoping he Poor shot selection, and it? It is,
he was on the baseline and the ball is coming through flat and hard.
But if Andy Murray wants to play it, then he should, because the
opponent never knows what is coming up. It is the right shot if he
makes it, the wrong shot if he There was a very interesting
article that was re tweeted about how easy he was to underrate as a
tennis player when he first arrived Murray was laying down some rubber
on the court here. He was pulled and pushed around but he is just so
And this is the essence of the problem for the Spanish player
today. That rally, the first rally of this game, was everything that
he does and editing that is good enough against everyone else apart
from the top four.    and When you don't have that big weapon
of a serve, you cannot give away too many donations and a drop shot
on the first point, making life a Murray had the opportunity to come
forward in the rally there but I think it is a sign that he does not
feel the ground shots of Ferrer so much that he stayed in the rally
and got the unforced error, and now Talking of unforced errors, Murray
will be very disappointed making a routine backhand mistake on break
Just look at Ferrer and you can see the hours that he has trained,
can't you? The same with Murray, mind you. It looks like he has

First blood, Murray. He has just continue to improve,
hasn't he? Do you remember that little guy who arrived at Queen's
Club all those years ago? He is built like an oak tree now. When he
first came on the scene, he had not had the opportunity to do the work,
he had not developed or grown properly. He looked like he had
been shot in one match when he got cramp and fell down. But you look
at him now, the athletic ability, the speed of movement, it is almost
a given for these top players. This movement at the back of the
court has made him difficult to shed. There have been times in his
career when he has looked the most solid at the back of the court,
even more so than Nadal at times. Can he convert that into a rise?
Just one more little piece in the jigsaw and he may elevate himself.
This tournament is bigger than the masters 1,000 series. This is the
finale of the season, or only eight players here.    only eight players

When we talk about Murray's mentality, one of the big challenge
is for him is dealing with adversity. When things are going
well he is a great player and he is going to win. When things are not
going quite so well, that is when he has to stay strong and in the

Sorry, he has won seven out of weight points. Even though for her

saying, this is what I have got, I am going to see how well I can do
This is already looking a bit different. It really all depends on
whether Murray can play to a standard required or not. Ferrer is
going to flat line all the way through it. That is what he does
and he has had a very successful year. Semi final of the Australian
Open, where he lost to Murray. Final off Monte Carlo. You do not
qualify for this event without having a fantastic year. It is the
top eight players. He was in the final of two Masters Series. I
think you're right. Murray is going to decide this match, but that does
not necessarily mean he will win it. He has to play well, play
consistent tennis and not make unforced errors.
You have to do the physical work against Ferrer, and it hurts.
Absolutely. He will try to move you around and keep you on the
defensive as much as possible. You saw how Murray was able to get his
nose in front by breaking through. The moment his level dropped, he
dropped serve and now he is serving that really is Ferrer's bread and 
butter   great, clean hitting, corner to corner. He managed to get
the unforced error from Murray. That dialogue starts with the box
How's that? Inside the court, moving forward, plenty of us back
spin on that    plenty of back spin. Murray obviously came into this
service game with a first serve percentage of just 18. He has taken
a little bit of pace off of these first three. He got a cheap point

How does he win at point? No idea. Courtesy of a really great

tremendous from Ferrer. Listen, magnificent from Murray. I'm not
taking anything away. And the big point. Murray was able to rip that
backhand past. Just a mass of here Murray's first serve Mrs, they have
Oh! Wow! How hard did he hit that? Very! It really did not look like
it could be attacked. But he stepped in and rusted across the
court. Look at this.    rushed it. That is one of the hardest
Both play as sending messages about their athletic ability. You felt
that Murray won the point on a few occasions there and Ferrer felt
like he was going to win the point. A big hold for Murray to get back
on level terms at 3 3. The there was a great rally between
Nadal and Djokovic in the US Open That's it for the fluffy old tennis
balls. New balls can make any difference. If it is going to help
anybody it will probably be Murray on his serve. This is the serve
direction when they last played, which was the final of the Shanghai
masters. Murray gained most of them to the backhand of Ferrer.   
Murray directed most of them. Mrs it for today. Not very many to
choose from. He has not got much control of the length or the
direction at the moment. Definitely struggling to control the first
serve. Only at 32%. Again someone like Ferrer you would feel that you
want a few more cheap points to get your nose in front. When you're in
a battle with somebody like Ferrier, a tough nut, you have to be
prepared to take some pain, to put the work in. Ferrer is not going to
give cheap points. You want Murray to be proactive, not reactive. He
is serving 3 4. His first serve has An entertaining match for the
afternoon crowd here. It is the second day of the world tour finals.
The second ace for Murray Great play from Ferrer. But that is
getting him out of his comfort zone. When he has to play drop shot I
think he is getting away from his game plan. He had Murray moving
40 minutes into the match or thereabouts, his body has settled
into a nice rhythm. He has settled into his opponent's play. We think
this court is a little bit slower than last year. Everything is
settling down now. An interesting We talk about it all the time as we
move towards the business end of the set every unforced error get
magnified. A little chance for Some good professional tennis going
on here. Aback can slice down the line from Murray there.    a
Yes, that was another big moment that, wasn't it? On the first point

the pressure moving tomorrow. You look at the nature of these two
players, there have only been 12 winners and 13 unforced errors, a
reflection of how well they both move. It has been a little bit
scrappy so far. Ferrer's nickname is the wall. You can understand
where that comes from. He is such a great mover, moving forward not
always so comfortable, his serve is not a great weapon, but he is there
and not going away until you have chiselled at him and got him. He
never beats himself. It is a tough opener for Andy Marriott.

There is going to be a challenge, but more in hope than expectation.
The referee ordering the challenge, he said Andy Murray wants to
challenge the call, which is a surprise, because it is miles out
as far as we can see, and we are a long way away. Ferrer has a set
Look at Murray's game plan, it is almost like he is playing the score
rather than each point as it comes, because when he is down he is so
much more aggressive, looking to take the ball on. That is how he
has got to love to play all the And this time Ferrer takes it. It
is a set to the Spaniard, this is a bit of a turn up. And I believe a
medical time out is about to be called. And the trainer is on. This,
I suppose if you look back for signs of any injury to Andy Murray,
it was fairly early on in this match, clearly having trouble with
his service rhythm and having trouble on a couple of ground
strokes as well, particularly when moving to the backhand side. So he
is going to get treatment. This could be anything from lower back
through hip flexor, hip joint, Well, Federer had to struggle like
mad to get past song there, the world number six, in the first
match on Sunday afternoon. Against the world No. 8, Mardy Fish, Rafael
Nadal had to struggle. Now Andy Murray will have to struggle to get
through this match, seemingly physically and mentally as well
because it is tough to concentrate if you're in to it    if you are
injured. Probably the last person you want to play in this situation
is David Ferrer, because they are having long, physically demanding
rallies. Murray will have to take a look at his game plan and see
whether he needs to take more risks, be aggressive, keep the points
shorter. That certainly looks like hip treatment that he is getting,
whether it is hip flexor will on the lack    hip flexor on the left
leg, but it looks more like the Joint, doesn't it? Everyone is
leaving, Tim! A good idea from David Ferrer, instead of sitting on
the court he may as well use the time and maybe have a bathroom
break. Definitely keep his focus, how he is playing the match, what
is working. The trainer would have been aware of this through Andy's
personal physiotherapist before the match began. This is not something
which is unfamiliar to tennis players, their hips take an
absolute battering with all of the rotation. And that will be the
battle now, as well as the physical side, to understand the work that
he has to do to get back in this match and win two sets straight
against the old Jew as a bunny at the other end, David Ferrer.   
Duracell bunny. It could serve to focus his game, make him more
aggressive, or it could make him more distracted, not able to hit
the shots that he wants to, so it will be interesting to see how the
early part of the second set unfolds. Most players come into the
season ending championship, we are in the 11th month of the season,
most come in with some niggling injuries, things that are not right,
and it has been one of the things that Andy has been vociferous about,
so has Rafael Nadal. Others less so, like Andy Roddick, but the length
of the season, the fact they need more down time. There was a
suggestion that if the players were not listen to, then they might
discuss strike action, which, on a personal note and as a former
member of the ATP Tour player Council, I thought was ridiculous.
I don't think there was any real talk of a strike. The players said,
we might talk about it if we are not listen to, and it came out in
public which was bad PR. I'm sure that was not how they wanted it to
come out, but if you look at the way the ATP is structured, 50%
tournaments, 50% players and it is right that the players have
representation just for themselves. You look at how this unfolded at
the US Open, the scheduling is a huge issue and one that certainly
does not favour the players. The first round played over three days,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the semi final on Saturday, the final
on Sunday, and those are issues they want player representation to
get changed. They have got representation, they have their
agents and their voices as well. But the way that the ATP is
structured, it is and 50% by the players and 50% by the tournaments.
You are saying the top four are not listen to? Of course they are, but
if they want to vote on it there are three representatives for the
players and three for the tournaments, so if there is a vote,
three players say yes and three of the tournament    three for the
tournament say no. The Grand Slams, which is what they had the problem
with, it was raining and the schedule was even worse this year
seemingly than other times because of the rain, that is an IT s issue.
That is right. Another organisation the players have to deal with. But
from looking at the history of the way the tour is being    the Wade
the tour has been, the player should stand alone. Talking about
tennis politics, we could be here a while! Look, will you Murray me?
