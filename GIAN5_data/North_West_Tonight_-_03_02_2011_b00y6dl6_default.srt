We will have more of these tomorrow. Justice for Edith   her family
appeal for help in catching the killer who set fire to her bed as
she slept. She must have been terrifying. These are the thoughts
that stay with you, that this was an old lady so happy with life,
Tonight. I'm Gordon Burns. And I'm Annabel Tiffin. Also in the
programme: there is a "big society" in Liverpool, and I am here to
celebrate that. It was Cameron's big idea last year
but Liverpool is now pulling out. Chinese wishes for the new year.
Hearts full of hope for a good new year but how much can you wish for?
I have done loads and loads. And being funny for money   it's
time to get your red noses on! Hopefully people will dig deep and
Those stories coming up. First, it's time to pipe on board Dianne
Oxberry. And prepare to put your city
rivalries aside, as a large piece of Manchester visits Liverpool.
After 30 years in the Royal Navy, HMS Manchester comes to Liverpool
for the last time. Join me later Edith Stuart was 96 and didn't have
an enemy in the world. But someone crept into her room at a Lancashire
rest home and set fire to her bed as she slept. She died. Three other
elderly residents were also hurt. That was in October but still no 
one's been brought to justice. So now her family have made a public
appeal for help in catching those That was on Friday. Memories of a
much loved mother. She was content and happy. Edith Stuart's daughters
are at a loss to explain why anyone would want to hurt her, let alone
and walked away, leaving her there. It must have been so frightened him.
She must have been absolutely terrified. These are the thoughts
that stay with you, that this was an old lady, so happy with life, so
kill her straight away, and she lived for 30 hours. We could not
touch her, could not hold her hand, stroke her arm, Pat her back. We
could not hope her. We had to stand there and touched her cheek and say,
we are here for you. But that is all we could do. We felt so
helpless. It happened at this rest  home in Cleveleys, Lancashire, last
October. It is horrible to think what she and her family have gone
through. A horrendous crime. I tend to feel that whoever went in and
deliberately murdered my mother needs help. And it is not as much
punishment that we want for them as help. Disastrous as it was for
Edith, it could have been worse. Three other elderly residents and
two members of staff had to go to hospital after inhaling smoke. Two
people were arrested soon after the fire but later released without
charge. The police and Edith's family hope that by publicising the
case, someone will come forward with vital information that will at
last lead to justice for the 96  year old. It has brought the family
more close together because we are trying to achieve the same end,
that somebody is caught for doing this and no other family is going
to suffer in the same way. If the Prime Minister's going to
achieve his vision of a "big society" he's going to have to do
it without Liverpool. The leader of the council has written to David
Cameron telling him the city's pulling out of plans to promote the
idea in Merseyside. It's a major blow to the Prime Minister, because
Liverpool was one of four areas chosen for a "big society" pilot
scheme. Stuart Flinders is in Liverpool. What's gone wrong?
it's the cuts, basically. Liverpool council says that the need to make
big savings in the wake of the Spending Review is undermining
efforts to implement "big society" ideas. The organisations that were
going to get involved are now struggling to survive.
David Cameron, striding out with Brookside creator Phil Redmond last
summer. It was here in Liverpool that the Prime Minister laid out
plans for a "big society". There is a "big society" in Liverpool, where
people do great work on behalf of their communities, and I am here to
celebrate that and look at how we can expand it. Phil Redmond was
keen to give it a go and Liverpool was chosen as one of four areas to
lead the way. Mr Redmond chairs National Museums Liverpool and he
saw them and the Merseyside Fire Service as the key to the "big
society" programme, but the museums now face cuts of 15%, and the fire
service has an £8.5 million shortfall. Today, Mr Redman said
the cuts have killed the "big society" idea. And the council
leader has written to the Prime Minister saying he is throwing in
the towel. The most important people are the voluntary and
community sectors. We are having to drastically reduce support to them.
I find it really difficult to live with myself, being hypocritical
trying to support a Government who is talking about the "big society"
and at the same time to administer some of these cuts. David Cameron
visited Merseystride, where they help the homeless and unemployed,
and he said this was what he meant by "big society". Now, facing
funding cuts, they feel let down. He used the words, Merseystride is
the "big society" in action. At the heart of a lot of communities in
the UK, they had a great opportunity to work with us to make
a difference in this area. I do feel let down. How much damage will
this do to the Prime Minister's project? One local MP says it is
time to think again. Will the Leader of the House find time to
debate the Prime Minister's pet project, the so called "big
society"? Labour says the Government's "big society" is
imploding. The Prime Minister's spokesman says they have received
Liverpool council's letter and they will look at it to see if there are
any barriers to the project, obviously still hoping to make it
work. It is worth noting that one of the other four areas that were
meant to start the "big society" idea, Sutton in south London, are
not giving up and are still going ahead. Their leader said tonight
they are disappointed Liverpool has pulled out, it is all about
involving people in the right way. The head of a group of hospitals in
the north west says there will have to be significant job losses. The
Chief Executive of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Trust
says there will also have to be a review of clinical services. The
trust, which runs hospitals in South Cumbria and Lancaster, needs
to save £15 million in the next year.
It will cost more to go through the Mersey Tunnel from April. The
Merseytravel committee voted earlier today to put the car
charges up by 10p. It will now cost £1.50 per car to go through the
tunnel. The former leader of Liverpool City
Council Mike Storey has been made a Lord by the Liberal Democrats. The
head teacher is one of 50 new members of the House. Earlier today
he was given the title of Lord Storey of Liverpool.
A ceremony's been held in Liverpool to mark the life and work of the
writer Robert Tressell. The Irishman was on his way to Canada
100 years ago when he died in Liverpool. He's most famous for his
book about working class poverty The Ragged Trousered
Philanthropists. His book was very important to me. It changed my life
because I registered in the segregation unit, a solitary
confinement with in solitary confinement. I had nothing to do
their, and I read it and it changed my life.
It's 18 months since 29 year old Alex Humphreys disappeared
backpacking in Panama. His distraught family from Stockport
were then given the terrible news a body had been found. But that was
six months ago. Despite giving a DNA sample, his mother, Gill, has
no idea whether the body is Alex. She says she's been met with a wall
of silence from the Panama authorities, until the BBC
intervened. Abbie Jones has been speaking to her. Every morning I
come down, switch on the computer, look for replies to e mails, look
for new information. Sometimes it is there, more often it is not. I
am just weary of it. This is Gill Humphreys' daily routine. Her son,
Alex, disappeared in Panama in 2009. His parents went out there twice,
hiring a private investigator, got what    got little help from the
authorities. Gill was told two bodies had been found. One has been
ruled out but the second has not been tested. She says the
bureaucracy is a nightmare. What the Foreign Office can and cannot
do, according to protocol, what police can and cannot do with each
other. If it is not him, it is somebody's sum, and nobody appears
to be doing anything about it. took her paperwork and her plight
to BBC Radio Manchester. They found a Spanish speaker who was given
contacts and information. managed to stir things up overnight,
where I have been trying to stir them up for the last 18 months.
Interpol in Panama told us they will now always be open to help and
will keep her informed of any advances. But there are still
unanswered questions. The local coroner in Panama has said she
knows nothing about the body. And without a body, or proof of death,
Alex's parents cannot move on. The family cannot organise his funeral
without a death certificate. They also cannot do anything about his
bank account, his pension, and the letters are just mounting up. With
every day that passes, the family fear the likelihood of finding out
what happened to him is slipping further away.
Still to come: Prayers for the dawn of a Chinese
new year   we join Buddhist celebrations overnight.
And Anthony Cotton will be telling us why we should be getting ready
There were cheers and tears in equal measure on the River Mersey
today as the destroyer HMS Manchester sailed into Liverpool at
the end of an era. The 5000 ton ship is being decommissioned from
the Royal Navy. It's been affiliated to the city of
Manchester for 30 years. The ship's company will be given the freedom
of the city at the weekend. And the gangways to the vessel are being
opened up to the public. Dianne is already on board to get a sneak
preview. Yes, this is the definition of
military strength. It is very impressive   HMS Manchester. She is
141 metres long, 5200 tons. She is a Type 42 Batch 3 air defence
destroyer. Not just a warship, but a destroyer. She is being
decommissioned at the end of the month but over the last 30 years
she has served the Royal Navy well. Let me introduce you to the ship's
commanding officer. Good evening and thank you for having us on
board. You are welcome. Talk me through her military career.
has seen service all over the world. She was in the first Gulf war in
the early 90s. She has done three round the world trips. She escorted
the US carrier the year before last. She has worked recently in the
Caribbean where the ship was doing disaster relief. As the world has
changed, her role has changed and she has been involved in the war
against narcotics. I think of that as involving stealth. How does a
ship like this get involved? would be surprised. She might be
5000 tonnes, but she can blend in. It is the nature of her being a
warship, designed for stealth against the enemy, which means we
can be stealthy against drug smugglers. We had recent successes
with marijuana and cocaine totalling nearly £20 million of
pure cocaine that we stopped getting to the UK. She was
significant in the history of Cuba. We were the first Royal Navy
warship to visit in 53 years, since before the Cuban revolution. It was
an amazing five days. We were able to get there and welcome a lot of
Cuban people on board to look around, nearly 1000 in under two
hours. Sailing up the River Mersey for the last time, what is it like?
A city like this, fantastic. We are here to visit our adopted city of
Manchester as well for the last time and on Saturday we will do our
freedom of the city much for the last time with colours flying and
bayonets fixed. I will hand back the freedom scroll to the Lord
Mayor of Manchester. Every time the ship has come to Manchester, we
come to Liverpool. It is the safest and closest place we can get to and
we have an affinity with the city and have always enjoyed a friendly
welcome. I got rather surprising welcome. You had sailors with guns,
as you walk on board! Indeed, we are a warship, a military
establishment. I am responsible for making sure the ship and the
company are looked after. These days, in changing times, it is
important to maintain security. people of the north west will give
you a warm welcome over the next couple of days. It is important
that the Royal Navy does this to say thank you. Yes, without the
public support we would not be able to do the job we do. This gives an
opportunity to come and open the ship up to people and the ship will
be open to visitors on Sunday from 12:00pm until 5pm, and everyone is
welcome to have a look around. Thank you for having us on board.
You are welcome. The weather looks lively for the weekend so join me
later for the details. I was in Liverpool earlier and it
is very windy. Sport now, and Liverpool's record
signing, Andy Carroll, says he doesn't feel under any pressure to
justify his fee. The £35 million striker was introduced to the media
today along with the club's other big arrival, Luis Suarez. And
Carroll, who's injured at the moment, says he can't wait to get
started at Anfield. It was a lot of money, but I am sure I can do what
I need to do to prove that the money was worth it, really. Coming
to Liverpool has been fantastic. The reception at the training
ground and last night was brilliant. Liverpool are one of
the great European teams. It has always been a dream to come to a
big club in England and I have come to a massive club.
Well, Luis Suarez certainly made an impact on his debut at Anfield last
night. The Uraguayan international scored in Liverpool's 2 0 win at
home to Stoke. The Reds are up to seventh, just one place above
Bolton Wanderers who also took three points at home to Wolves.
Daniel Sturridge, who was also making his debut, got the only goal
of the game. Blackpool and Blackburn both lost at home, while
Manchester City could only manage a 2 2 draw at Birmingham, despite
this stunning free kick from Now, you may remember that during
last night's programme we broke the surprise news that Manchester
United defender Gary Neville was retiring from the sport. Well today
the 35 year old has been reflecting on a career which saw him claim the
Champions League, eight Premier League titles and make 85
appearances for England. He says he'd been considering retirement
for a few weeks and knew that this was the time. I played my last game
against West Bromwich and came to the conclusion pretty quickly after
that that I did not feel right and that time was up. I did not want to
delay it. I think the manager and the club deserve, after everything
they have done for me, to know that. They accepted and supported me in
the decision. There were few rumours on Twitter and Facebook
that he might be going on to something else.
Some sad news now. The former Manchester City forward Neil Young
has died at the age of 66. The striker was the club's top scorer
when they won the old First Division in 1968 and netted the
only goal when City lifted the FA Cup in 1969. His team mate Mike
Summerbee paid this tribute to him. He was a very special person in the
team we played in, and his contribution to Manchester City in
that era was fantastic. His contribution in vital moments,
vital games. His contribution was brilliant.
Kung hei fat choi. That's Chinese for Happy New Year. And there was
plenty of that greeting last night as Chinese communities across the
region came together to celebrate a special time of year. Hundreds of
people attended a ceremony at one of the north west's largest temples
in Stretford in Greater Manchester. Paresh Patel was there.
From Liverpool to Hull, Newcastle to Congleton, hundreds came to this
temple in Stretford last night to welcome in the Chinese New Year.
They also came for enlightenment. New year's Day, New year's Eve, is
very important to Chinese people because it is to remind all Chinese
people about their own culture. Buddhists believe that now has the
time to ask God for good fortune to overcome life's worries. I also
wished for my daughter to do well at school and be healthy and be
good, and also my business to be prosperous. We need to repent of
whatever we did wrong in the past to the Buddha. It is a way to
cleanse our wrongdoings. It is also the time to pay homage to the its
spirits of your ancestors. But for most, like this mother and daughter,
the new year simply offers a beacon of hope. We have come to wish for
the whole year, hopefully for the future, in future the whole year
that is going to be happy, healthy and, you know, hopefully peace.
a divine wishing tree could grant any wish, what with a seven year 
old ask for? Loads and loads and loads. Which is most important?
most important one is to protect me and have a happy family. 15 days of
festivities will follow to celebrate the year of the rabbit.
Now, you might think it's cold outside but just before we go back
to Dianne, let's just tell you about something on tomorrow night's
programme. We've sent Andy Gill somewhere really cold.
Tomorrow evening, a special report from Norway, where an army captain
from Cheshire is training with a group of other soldiers to walk
across the Arctic ice to the North Pole. But not just any group of
soldiers. They have all been wounded in battle. Some are
amputees, some have paralysed limbs. They are hoping to be the first
group of such people to walk unaided across the ice to the North
Pole and also raise money for charity.
We can go back to Dianne Oxberry on HMS Manchester in Liverpool for the
shipping forecast, no, the weather At times like this, my camera man
reminds me that I look like a dog on a motorbike with my hair blowing
everywhere, dressed in the thinnest coat and the highest shoos! I am
sure you may have noticed as you were driving on the motorways, big
signs saying that on Friday on the motorway the wind will be
incredibly strong. That is what we are dealing with as we head through
to Sunday. We have Met Office warnings of gales and heavy rain.
We are looking at the first signs of rain coming in tonight. If we
look at the pressure chart, you can see the weather remains unsettled
all the way through to Sunday. Trailing weather fronts across the
country, focusing on Scotland and the north west of England. The
isobars are very tightly packed, so the winds are very strong. You can
tell they are strong already in Liverpool and they will continue
all the way through tonight over the Pennines, up to 65 mph. Cross
winds will be very difficult if you were driving on the motorways.
Conditions far from ideal. As the rain starts to make itself felt in
Cumbria, we are talking perhaps 100 millimetres over a couple of days.
Just about anywhere could see up to 60 mm. So this is a significant
weather period for the north west of England. Through the night, the
rain will dead in three huge portion of the night. Wet and windy.
Temperatures should not fall too low. But it is that weather front
trailing over us meaning that when you get up tomorrow morning it will
be cloudy with no brightness and the rain will keep coming. The wind
will ease through the day a little bit but it will still be very
strong. Temperatures over the next couple of days are academic. As you
head through the weekend, the weather does not leave. At times,
the wind will get even stronger with possibly severe gales. The
amount of rainfall will be significant. If you want more
details, join us at 10:25pm. I am surprised become a man could
Show us the colour of your money, and I guess it's going to be red.
That's right, Red Nose Day is almost upon us. The Comic Relief
campaign launches today, raising lots of money for the region. Since
1988 over £19 million has been spent in the north west and over
700 grants have been awarded. So as we all prepare to be funny for
money, I caught up with Coronation Street's Antony Cotton, who's
helping to launch this year's appeal, and I asked him where the
Comic Relief money goes. People assume that Comic Relief
raises money for causer as in other countries, but Comic Relief has
always raised money for our own country and our own communities.
Hopefully people this year will see that there is money raised for
people in their own communities, especially in the north west.
are the sort of projects, Anthony, that the money will go to in our
region? There is a big difference in the kind of groups, but for
example there is a mountain rescue team that need extra funds. And
there is a children's can be choir in Warrington. What about yourself?
You have won several awards for soap operas, the ideal man for
comic relief. What are you getting up to? I am not sure. They are
thinking of things for me to do, trying to get me on top of a
mountain to be rescued, I think. We will see. The launch day is today
and the actual event is on March 18th, so between now and then, I am
sure they will think of me! have a red nose there. It is quite
interesting the different ones that there are this year, including one
that grows and a runny nose, which I hope is not what it sounds like!
I have not got one of those. I have got one with teeth. You can get
them in Sainsbury's, or online. I believe they also have them for
your car as well. I remember having won when I was younger. Yes, these
are the ones available on Lynn. Hopefully we have gone through the
recession and people will dig deep and prove we are the great British
public and we will help support the people that need it. Thank you for
mentioned the runny nose. It is this one. If you wind it up... Not
