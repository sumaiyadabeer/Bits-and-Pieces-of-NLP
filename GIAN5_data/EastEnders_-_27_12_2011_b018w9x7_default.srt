  So, Yusef did that, eh?
  Shh.
  What?
All right, guys?
It's one thing me lending you Kat's clobber. It's another you looking better than her!
Oi, oi, oi, come on. It's all right. It's all right.
Come on, girls, you don't need to see this.
Come on, off you go. Go on. That's it.
He has full thickness burns.
He'll need skin grafts.
Why did he even go into that building?
He thought I was there.
Afia Masood?
Can we have a word?
Dad, you...
SHE HUMS Ding Dong! Merrily On High
Ooh, I thought you'd gone to see Sonia with the others?
No, didn't fancy it.
Nana Pat?
Liam?
There's these trainers, in the sale. They're only twenty pounds.
You've already had your presents!
But I really wanted trainers.
Did you see what happened out there last night?
Just be grateful that weren't us!
Try being happy with what you've got.
I've been discharged. Someone's got to come and get me.
And hurry up, will you?
I've got to get to Denise before she does something stupid.
Your dad, he's been discharged.
  Not that you'd care.
  See. I knew he'd be all right.
He just wanted to wind everyone up.
You make me sick.
Thank you.
Mum.
Mum, we can see Tam now.
I don't think I can do this.
  I should go be with Kamil.
  Amira's got him. It's Tambo who needs his mum right now.
They found my dad.
  She OK?
  She's been in the hospital all night talking to the police. She's exhausted.
Either you go in there or I will, and if I get soot on these shoes, trust me, you're going to take me
down to Oxford Street in that fancy van of yours and foot the bill. So what's it going to be?
  Huh?
  All right then.
Come on, like I was said, Kat's taken the kids to Charlie's.
  We'll get the football on in the pub and have a bit of a lock in.
  Yeah...
What's the matter with you? Cheer everybody up! Birmingham away, we'll murder them.
  Come on, Paddy, what do you reckon? Come on...
  Jake!
  Oi, oi, oi, Alf.
I've found something. Can you log this down?
It's the fireworks.
Now, I knew the small matter of Christmas wouldn't keep you from your desk.
If you sing Silent Night, I might take a contract out on your life.
So, that's what happened to all the carol singers round here.
Actually I was wondering if you fancied a bit of disaster tourism, check out that B&B.
  We don't have to call it a date.
  Well, you know how to treat a girl.
Thought there might be a good investment opportunity in it for us.
  For us?
  Sorry, I didn't know. Shall I come back later.
No. What, did you just miss me so much you had to drop in to see me?
No, no, no, just thought you might want some lunch.
Well, I've got to finish making these hovels sound like palaces for the website.
  Why don't you two go?
  We don't have to call it a date.
Liam!
Now, that's not the look of Yuletide cheer, is it, eh? What's up?
  Well, Nana Pat won't let me buy these trainers I was after.
  Ah, you mean she won't give you the money.
  They're in the sale!
  Well, if you want to earn a bit of cash...
  You're not going to tell him, are you?
  Oh, so you DO care.
If I don't tell him, he's going to go straight round Jack's as soon as he gets home.
  When does it all end? With guns?
  Look, he'll kill me, all right.
You'll have blood on your hands twice over. Please, Shirl.
You stood opposite me, Kevin dead...
and you told me you were on your way to get something fixed.
Kevin knew that car was dodgy as soon as he got in it. You know that.
Did he really mention me?
What was it you said?
How he wanted my hand on his face.
Yes.
No, don't believe you. You're both murderers, as far as I'm concerned.
You on your way to the police station, are you?
No, to the hospital. They're discharging him.
The hospital? No, no way.
You ready?
This sort of thing never happened to Indiana Jones.
  You found it. You found it! Thank you so much!
Thank you so much.
you've got the confession. You've had it all night. What, you looking for something to play it on? Pops!
(I've got a stitch...)
Pops! Look, I supervised the recovery of something for you!
  Sorry it's a bit burnt.
  I can sort that out for you.
  Really?
  Yeah, it's the least we can do.
Why?
Thank you.
I can't tell you how much...
Now, if you want to earn a bit of cash... take that B&B. Decent bit of scrap in that.
  Yeah?
  Yeah. Copper piping's gold dust at the minute.
  If I was you, I'd get in there and see what I could see.
  Yeah, but there might be bodies.
You never seen a dead body before? Well, now's your chance!
  Get in there, see if you can spot one.
  I don't want to see one.
Oi, your mother know you're out, Liam?
She's visiting Auntie Sonia.
Hi, Derek.
Important part of a man's life, seeing his first corpse.
Gives him perspective. Gives him respect.
I'm telling you, mate, get in there. It's a gold mine.
Honestly.
Pat?
I wanted to find Patrick. Give him his present.
All right, all right. Breather first?
  Yeah.
  Yeah?
Least you could do? You might as well have just told Kim we had illegal fireworks in her house!
My throat, it feels really tight.
Oh, well, maybe you should call the doctor, then, Ant. Oh, no wait a minute, we killed him.
They fly so high Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams They fade and...
I think I know what we need. Especially you. Paddy?
  What's that?
  A good old knees up.
Dad!
All right, all right I don't need perfume inhalation an' all.
See, I told you he'd be all right.
  Right, let's get going. I need to speak to Denise.
  No, Phil.
  Don't even think about telling me that I need a rest.
  It's not just that.
  I think we should go home.
  Is something wrong?
  Can we please just go?
Actually you can't. DI Savage, Walford CID. This is DC McEwan.
You one of them kiss o grams or something? Cos it ain't my birthday!
Philip Mitchell. I'm arresting you for the murder of Kevin Wicks.
You do not have to say anything but...
I always had this thing as a kid. I always wanted to tear down the decorations come boxing day.
Cos after the presents go, you know, the tree and the tinsel, they look a bit tawdry, don't they?
A bit forlorn.
You must have been a happy child(!)
I think I just wanted to get rid of the old year, make way for the new one.
You're not supposed to feel like that till you're a grown up.
Saw your Liam with Derek earlier.
Probably trying to enlist his services in some scam.
You're just winding me up. You don't give a toss about Liam,
you just want Derek away from Janine.
And you want him away from the boy.
Which makes us an alliance of sorts.
What are you saying?
That we should do something. Get rid.
You know, in time for the New Year.
Now, it's just a matter of choosing the right moment.
  This really isn't the place to bring kids, Derek.
  Right everybody, come and get it.
It's the bacon roll emergency committee!
  Here we go.
  If you're in uniform, you qualify! Sorry about that, folks.
Right, while they're stuffing their faces. Go on, now, lively.
Teas and coffees, West Ham mug, that's my one.
All right, sweetheart. There you go.
The rest of you, if you want to make your way into the Vic,
for a glass of festive cheer, there's nothing else to see here.
Always wanted to say that.
Oi, there's a perfectly good bench over there.
I'm sitting here in someone else's clothes, nowhere to live and I'm trying to...
  Kev died cos of Phil...
  I think you need a drink, love. Come on.
Come on.
There was more, but... there was a shoe.
A shoe?
Well, like a fancy one. Like the doctor would wear.
Well, you should get back in there.
Bit of luck, the other shoe might have a foot in it.
That was a joke, kid.
Here we go, you did well. See what a bit of entrepreneurial spirit gets you?
Have I just seen what I thought I'd seen. What were you doing in there?
And where's your cap? You was wearing it this morning.
Didn't suit him anyway.
Go home. And wait there till I've decided what to do with you!
Liam, home. Now!
I knew this would come back to haunt you. Had to be Christmas, didn't it?
  It's been so long, how are you?
  I'm not in the mood.
Flying out to the Maldives tomorrow to patch things up with the missus.
  A Yuletide Elastoplast.
  Well, if it tanks, don't go to Jimmie for the settlement.
  He made a pig's ear of getting Amy back.
  We all have off days.
Yeah, well, you better not have one today.
So, where we at?
They've got a taped confession, Phil. Hardly ideal is it?
The frame... You've done a fantastic job.
Thank you.
  That is the least we could do.
  Can I have your attention please? Thank you.
Now, as you know, we have some friends with us today
that, unfortunately, last night, lost a lot
and I think as a community we should be taking care of them, am I right?
And it's still Christmas so let's make sure they don't go without a drink, OK?
So, dig deep, folks, come on!
We should tell him now. It weren't our fault, mate, all right?
  Yeah well, bagsy not me.
  Bagsy? How old are you?
Patrick, I'm so sorry.
Well, the girls and them are OK, that is the main thing.
I got you a little something, it's not much.
Patricia this is a beauty.
Well, here's looking at you, kid.
I'm going to get us another little drink.
Alfie, Nice drop of gold watch for me and a G&T for the lady, please.
You don't mind me buying your woman a drink, do you, Michael?
No, no. Fill your boots, Derek, fill your boots.
Bit weird you're not buying anyone else one, though.
Pat, what you having?
Nothing from you.
Can't say I didn't try.
I thought I'd have palaces in all the cities, you know.
And everybody would stay there. Oprah.
  Sorry love. Denise, we need to talk.
  They've arrested him at the hospital!
Good.
  So that makes you happy, does it? Do you think it'll bring Kevin back?
  How dare you!
  Let's talk out the back.
  We did this to protect you. Tell her, Pat.
It was better you didn't know everything.
You thought it was just me, didn't you? Well, it ain't!
Listen, I loved Kevin dearly. His death was a tragedy.
But what good would it have done you, Carly, Deano, even Libby and Chelsea
to have known all the details?
Wasn't your grief enough?
You were so devastated. We couldn't add to that!
My life. My life is mine.
It's not yours to just edit as you see fit. No, no.
How could you? How could you, Pat?
No, I want to be alone!
Derek. About them fireworks...
Yeah?
They all went up in the fire. It wasn't our fault!
Fireworks?
Take a day off, Stalin.
Nothing in my licence conditions says I can't have a good time.
  Stalin?
  I prefer Joseph. I'm Derek's probation officer.
I can't just be happy. He's dead.
He's my dad!
No one expects that.
But you can have your life back. You can have Zainab back.
It's not like that.
I want my dad back.
Come...
Let's pray for him.
There you go, Paddy.
If I get a report that you're on the rob, I've got to investigate.
Oh, come on, Jo! Look, if you do this every time someone with
a grudge wants to grass me up, you might as well move in with me.
  Now there's a thought.
  That's the trouble with you probation officers  
you're always worrying about what's going on in the gutter, you miss what's going on up here.
And what is it I'm missing?
That I'm an honest man. Tell him, Alfie.
Tell Stalin here what a pillar of the community I am!
  Salt of the earth, our Derek.
  Yeah, I don't know what we'd do without him.
Michael!
  Hey, boys.
  Hey, Kimmy.
  You all right?
  What you drinking?
No, I better go find Denise.
  I can't leave her walking the streets. See you later.
  See you later.
I better nip home and check on Liam.
Kim, if you've got nowhere to stay tonight,
you can, um, stay at ours.
  Ours?
  Yours?
  Are you serious?
  Yeah.
Thank you so much! It's the best Christmas present ever!
Come on!
  Can your brother live with those two girls and keep his mouth shut?
  Yeah.
'No more stolen cars. No more cut and shuts.
'Want somebody else killed?'
So...that's pretty comprehensive.
I'm surprised you didn't admit to the Kennedy assassination while you were at it.
I would have said anything to get out of that situation.
Because what you can't see and you can't hear is that they pulled a knife on me.
What, are you suggesting you were forced into making this confession?
I feared for my life.
Reading from the transcript of the confession
"You ask me that again, I'll kick you out of that suit."
You don't sound overly concerned to me.
Well, of course I don't sound concerned.
You can't let them know that you're scared, can you? Got to give it to 'em back.
Is that all you've got? Because it really is pitiful cause to arrest my client.
No, it's not all we've got.
See, in a little room down the hall, there's a fella called Dougie.
And Dougie's faced with a choice.
Whether to tell us who sold the cars he stuck together...
..or whether to go to prison for even longer.
Afia, what are you going to say to him?
  I don't know.
  Well, think.
  Zainab.
I think...when he wakes...
..I'm going to say sorry.
I don't want to leave her tonight.
She needs you.
We all do.
Masood,
I've been thinking...
..about how you saved me all those years ago
and I was wondering, would you mind, please, doing it again?
You don't need saving.
You just need pointing in the right direction.
Mas... Come home. Come home.
Don't you talk to me like that! I saw you coming out of that building!
What if it had collapsed on your head?
  It was just a pipe.
  Well, I wonder if the police will see it like that.
  The police?
  Yeah.
Knock, knock. The door was open.
Thought I'd pop in and make sure Liam wasn't taking the heat for my mistakes.
Upstairs, Liam. Now.
I will not go back inside, Pat.
Then leave the boy alone.
Oh, I think the boy needs someone like me in his life.
I mean, Ricky hardly cuts it, does he?
Ricky is a good man.
Oh, I see, you're using the word "man" loosely there, very good.
Liam's a good little worker. Takes instructions.
Gets the job done.
How could you have let him go in that building, what if it had collapsed on him?
If you don't take any chances in life, Pat, you'll never get anywhere.
That boy did some growing up today.
Oh.
Now, here's one for you.
What happened to the old dear who couldn't keep her mouth shut?
No?
No one ever found out.
Shirl, Ritchie's here.
Is he out?
Shirley, they've... They've charged him.
Conspiracy to deal stolen cars.
It's serious. With the evidence they've got, he could get years.
Pat?
What's taking you so long, girl?
You know, everybody likes the hat, you know.
Pat?
Pat!
Pat!
