16 celebrities are battling it out
to win the coveted MasterChef crown.
I'd like to win it. That would be a wonderful feeling.
These celebrities have reached the top of their profession.
But can they cut it in the kitchen?
I'm having fun. I'm throwing myself out of my comfort zone.
I'd love to do well. I need a bit of help from the spiritual place.
Just watch this!
Cooking doesn't get tougher than this.
All this week, these four celebrities have been taking on the challenge
to become the next MasterChef champion.
But at the end of today, one of them will be going home.
Celebrity MasterChef and this competition just gets fiercer and fiercer.
Now is the time to step up to the mark.
This is really tough.
You are under the microscope.
I'd feel disappointed if I went, the first one to go.
I think I've got more to give.
It's exactly like an opening night of a play.
10,000 times worse when you're standing in the wings. When you're on stage, you go,
"OK, good. I'm here!"
I've thrown myself in several ways
on a couple of occasions, but I've learned
to accept the challenge as it unravels and give it my absolute best.
But to say that felt a bit like a rabbit caught in headlamps
is an understatement.
To decide who stays, the celebrities will face two challenges
to show just how far they've come.
We've tested their skills.
We've seen their teamwork, but we're back to individual tasks.
And we want to see how they cope on their own.
This is a tough, long day. At the end of this one of them is going to go home.
The classic recipe today is steamed sea bass with ginger and spring onions,
perfectly cooked rice and sweet chilli sauce.
Oh, baby!
The first thing I'm going to do is get the rice on.
Put some rice in a pot. You wash it three times to get rid of the excess starch.
Put it on the heat. You let it boil for five or six minutes. Turn the heat off.
Don't touch it. You must never ever, ever remove that lid.
And your rice will be perfectly cooked.
Now we're going to prepare the sea bass. I'm going to square the ginger off.
Spring onions the same and that then goes inside our bass.
And that becomes fragrant from the inside.
Ginger is very strong and it's too potent.
So it needs to be really fine.
Mix the ginger and the spring onions together.
Into a bowl, two or three spoonfuls of Shaoxing wine.
And then the soya sauce.
Half the quantity of soya sauce to the wine. Mix that all together.
Cut the tail off the bass.
Now make some little scoring bits
into the flesh.
Take a bit of banana leaf and put some holes in it,
so the steam can go through.
Put the banana leaf inside the steamer.
And then our fish on top.
Put on top of that the mixture of spring onions and ginger.
And then pour on to that our Shaoxing wine and our soya sauce.
Pop the lid back on the steamer.
Don't touch it for a good ten minutes.
I'm enjoying this recipe. I can't see any reason why they shouldn't do this with aplomb.
It's time to make sweet chilli sauce.
Not a difficult thing at all.
Two good size chillies, seeds removed.
Couple of decent pieces of pineapple in there.
And then about 100 grammes of sugar.
And about 100ml of vinegar.
Then add to that a decent splash of water.
On to the stove.
The sweet chilli sauce needs to boil for five minutes to cook the pineapple and chilli.
And then we just blend it in a food processor.
I can't see a lot going wrong with this, John. This is doable.
The next thing is to actually put the dish together on the plate.
We're now going to release the flavour of those spring onions
and bring this fish to life.
Seriously hot pan   been on the stove   with sesame oil.
Back on that heat for a second till it's almost about to smoke.
And then you pour.
Chinese sea bass, spring onions, ginger,
perfectly cooked rice and sweet chilli sauce.
John, we are in for a treat here, IF our celebrities are up to the challenge.
  Get 'em in?
  Let's get them in.
Welcome back to the start of a big day today.
We have a recipe   a John Torode recipe.
Today's classic recipe is steamed sea bass.
You do it properly, it will be beautiful.
You do it badly and it will be not very nice at all.
You will have one hour to cook this classic recipe. Do it well. Let's cook.
Justin   TV presenter and a property developer,
and a man who has eye for design.
It's a good looking, modern plate of food.
If he has a weakness, he tries to throw too much on a plate.
15 ingredients in one bowl.
He needs to focus today. Just deliver what needs to be delivered.
Forget the other bits and pieces. Just deliver the heart and soul of the dish.
I really hope that today gives me a new opportunity to excel.
I would really like to do well.
Justin, Asian food   the sort of food you love to cook?
I haven't cooked much Asian stuff before
and I'm not the biggest kind of fish cooker, to be frank.
  Why is it that you don't cook much fish?
  I'm a meat lover.
I've avoided fish. I think, like a lot of people, I'm wary of cooking fish.
That's why I'm here. I want to learn.
What happens if Colin goes and you stay, Justin? You love to work together.
Whichever of us does better than the other, I hope that one person represents the other.
  What do you have to do now in the competition?
  I want to get better. I want to stay the course.
  Today, boys, I need you to smile from ear to ear as you chow down on my fish.
  Hmm?
We know that Justin relies upon Colin for moral support.
He likes to work as a pair, but today he has to stand alone as an individual.
15 minutes you've had.
Danny   musician and a creative mind.
He cooks for his family and his friends. When he puts his mind to it,
he delivers food which is interesting and stylised.
It looked great when it went out.
It tastes great now on the plate. I think he's done a really good job.
But his dishes don't always hit the mark.
It needs more flavour.
There's a little hint of spice, but it needs more.
He may have what it takes. Today is going to show whether he is the real McCoy.
I guess my family have only ever seen me play music or make a lot of noise.
I think they just find it really funny.
They just think it's really weird that Dad's on telly, cooking.
How are you doing, Danny?
Comfortable, happy?
It's something I've never done before. This is a bit tricky.
But you've got to conquer your worries. Something new is good to learn.
  What's the competition mean to you, Danny?
  I'm getting a passion for it really.
I've been cooking for my family a lot. I cooked a big meal for my cousins last week.
The passion's growing a bit and it's something interesting to do with my hands.
  How is the competition for you?
  It's hard to tell.
I haven't destroyed anything yet, which is probably a good sign.
I want to get past the next stage and get into the semis.
That's my goal at the moment   to get into the semis.
  And what happens if you don't?
  If I don't, I'll just go down the pub or something.
Go and watch football.
Danny seems happy, although he's never done anything like this before.
It's now up to Danny to make sure he presents that dish beautifully.
You're halfway. Halfway.
  What's happened?
  I think I've overcooked my rice. I must have put too much water in it.
If you overcook that one, I have no more.
Sharon   a star of stage and television.
At the early stages of this competition, Sharon was unwell
and we haven't seen a huge amount of her, but what we have seen is truly impressive.
There's nothing wrong with your cooking that a deep breath and a count to ten wouldnt cure.
In the team challenges, she delivers.
That's not bad at all. I'm really impressed.
  Yeah, so am I.
  I'd eat the whole thing actually.
I wonder, with her being ill in the earlier rounds, whether that's hindered her development so far?
But today she's got a chance to make up ground.
It's unforgivable that I'm so terrified. It makes no sense at all.
I feel as though I'm going to the hangman's noose. It's ridiculous.
  Tell us what happened to your rice.
  I overcooked it.
Are you able to concentrate on one thing at a time?
Or does your mind just race everywhere all the time?
It tends to race. Focus is a big issue for me.
Can you focus enough to deliver a beautiful dish, flavoured well?
  I'm trying.
  Are you going to be as good on your own as you have been...?
I know, I know. It's a big issue for me, that.
I was missing Danny today. He was quietly watching my back. I liked that.
Sharon, she started OK and then she overcooked her rice.
I hope that hasn't knocked her confidence and I hope that means she can finish on time.
You have just under 20 minutes left.
Just under 20 minutes. Steamed sea bass, rice, sweet chilli sauce.
Colin   TV presenter and an interior designer.
Throughout this competition he has been consistent with his delivery.
I think that's a decent dish. The sort of thing I would order.
But he's made some technical errors.
Your heat is too high and you don't have enough oil in your pan.
He doesn't have a great deal of confidence, but he has the makings of a very good cook.
I feel like I want to know more.
I'm enjoying the fact that it's kind of unleashed...
..A hunger.
  Colin.
  Yes.
  Tough ask?
  For some weird, strange reason I feel more nervous than I've ever felt in my adult life.
  Really?
  It's bizarre. I've got that strange, pre exam feeling.
Do you think you're starting some of your tasks in a flap?
That is exactly it and the fact I'm in a flap is getting in the way of me getting on with it.
Do you think you may be in danger of going out the competition?
I can only do my best. I've really enjoyed being here. It's been a really positive experience so far.
  You are one half of a dynamic duo.
  Indeed.
What happens if Justin goes home?
I'll just have to step up to the plate and make it happen.
  Have you ever cooked fish?
  Never. This is my first fish.
  Wow!
  I'm a virgin, regarding all things fishy.
Colin's doing OK, but he looks nervous.
He's admitted he's never cooked a fish before.
What's the chance of cooking fish for the first time ever and it coming out perfectly?
You've got five minutes left.
Three minutes. Just three minutes.
30 seconds. Last 30 seconds. Finishing touches.
Time's up! Time's up! Finished.
We asked you to cook Chinese style sea bass with spring onions and ginger,
with steamed rice and a sweet chilli sauce.
You're up on time. That's great.
Now it's all about how it tastes and whether it's cooked properly.
  Danny, you're up first.
  Mm hm.
What are the black bits on your rice, Danny?
I think I might have drizzled a tiny bit of the sesame oil on it. But it was a mistake actually.
I think the other thing was your pan wasn't clean enough.
That sesame oil that goes over the top is to cook the spring onions.
It shouldn't have little black bits in the bottom of it.
Your fish is cooked beautifully. Still lovely and sweet and succulent inside.
I like the way the spring onions and ginger are cooked through. They're not big chunks.
Your chilli sauce is vibrant with chilli.
Your rice is cooked really, really well. I like it a lot.
I think you've done a really, really good job.
Really good job.
I can find nothing wrong with that whatsoever, Danny.
Absolutely nothing wrong with that.
  I would happily now eat the lot.
  Well, you can.
Danny, that's a really, really good dish.
Cheers. Thanks very much.
I burnt the oil a bit.
I thought I'd put a bit on the rice to make it taste of sesame oil. That was a silly decision.
Justin, let's have a look at yours.
Pineapple's not necessary. You're not going to eat it.
When you do things like that, it detracts from when you do a good job.
Good job! Good job. Nice, soft, meaty fish.
Sweet sauce with a tang. My only complaint is rice really watery.
  I rinsed it under boiling water.
  That's a mistake.
Beautifully steamed piece of fish, fragrant with ginger and spring onions.
Wonderful sweet chilli sauce, but your rice is overcooked
and you don't need to elaborate with the garnish.
From now on, no more garnish. I'm garnish free. I am!
I'm back to basics. I'm going nude. I am paring it back.
  Promise?
  On a stack of Holy Bibles, non denominational.
I need to stop garnishing, but I'm a designer. I'm always looking for ways to beautify.
I'm looking for ways to make the ordinary extraordinary. Pineapple didn't fall into that category.
Colin, let's have a look.
Your fish is lovely. It's cooked beautifully.
Your chilli sauce is a little bit jam like and the oil you put across the top was not hot enough.
Cold oil has gone on to the plate and sat underneath your rice and made your rice greasy.
Fish is cooked really well.
Really, really well, BUT the ginger hasn't cooked enough. Too powerful for me.
Sesame oil over the rice detracts from it.
Isn't it just the way that your rice is fine, your fish is fine,
and one little flash of smoking oil let's the whole thing down?
Sharon.
Fish, absolutely love it and love that the ginger has softened.
The rice is a bit firm. It would have been perfect if you'd cooked the rice a bit longer.
Your fish is cooked beautifully, but your rice is undercooked
and your sweet chilli sauce is too sweet.
But, for me, the best cooked piece of fish in the room.
Beautifully cooked. Love it!
My rice is bothering me.
Sometimes you get the ball in the goal mouth. Sometimes you don't. I didn't do my best.
The next time we see you,
one of you is going to be leaving us.
Thanks very much. See you soon.
Do you know what?
  I'm really impressed.
  I'm very impressed.
  Danny, group hug!
That was a solid round and a couple of contestants have surprised me.
Danny is class and he is growing in stature.
That guy is delivering on the money.
The only thing wrong with Danny's dish today was that oil was a little bit burnt.
Otherwise, Danny's dish was near on perfect.
Today, Justin gave me something I really, really enjoyed.
He couldn't resist his temptation to add more to it.
So we had two great big slices of pineapple for reasons best left unexplored.
But that rice was really overcooked and really watery.
And why he thinks he has to keep on adding things that aren't necessary, I am unsure.
Colin was honest enough to admit he'd never cooked a fish before.
Brilliant chilli sauce, beautifully cooked fish. The last two minutes was where it all fell down.
That sesame oil should have been boiling hot, then poured over the fish.
Instead it went all over the plate and made the whole thing greasy.
Sharon, for me, has a plate divided right down the middle.
One half has a brilliantly flavoured, wonderfully cooked fish in it.
The other one has undercooked rice.
If Sharon had concentrated on cooking that rice properly, she would have delivered a good dish.
So far this week, the celebrities have been tested on their basic skill.
Teamwork.
And refined cooking.
They now have one last chance to prove they've got what it takes to stay in the competition,
because one of them will be going home.
I always wonder what their own food is like. We're going to finally find out.
It is D Day. Finally, we're getting to do our own recipes.
Then, of course, one of us will be despatched.
When you're cooking your own food you feel slightly more responsible, cos you've got no excuses.
I feel like a broken record. I'm nervous.
I've gone through a whole gamut of emotions from blind panic to complete calm.
When I'm in front of Gregg and John, it's like being in the lion pit. Those boys are tough!
I'm feeling really, really happy about cooking my sort of ideas for food.
Knowing what I'm doing, I feel fairly confident.
One hour, your two dishes. This is where it truly counts.
Let's cook.
What are you making? What are your two courses, Colin?
I'm making a san choy bow   a chicken stir fry that should be a bite size bit of perfection.
And I'm doing my own version of the Scottish, deep fried Mars Bar.
I'm doing a chocolate and coconut tempura with homemade mango ice cream.
  Are you seriously going to deep fry a chocolate bar?
  Yes, I am.
  Why?
  People say about Scottish food, it's really bad for you
and yet you go to Asia and it's tempura and it's fantastic.
  Have you eaten a fried chocolate bar before?
  No.
  Have you made this dish before?
  Yes.
  Is that what you're going for? You want something different.
  Yeah.
I want more than meat, potatoes and veg. Don't underestimate the power of the bar.
Colin's going to deep fry a chocolate bar
and serve it with mango ice cream.
John, it might sound crazy. I'm actually really looking forward it. I'm intrigued.
We have an hour, and I have to make ice cream from scratch.
I've got to be able to scope out the ice cream and pop it on there
and for it to retain its form and not just to go phtt!
Nearly 20 minutes gone.
Endless things could go wrong today. You never know.
Hopefully, my hands will hold it together enough not to shake and throw it all around the room.
Sharon, what are your two dishes that will secure your place?
Sardines with arugula and tomato salad and salsa verde.
And then rack of lamb with mashed potatoes and green beans.
I might try and do a posh jus, but I'm getting the food done first.
What, for you, are the difficult parts of cooking these two courses?
I'm trying my best to be focused and coordinated and get the timing right.
  What sort of cook do you think you are?
  Well, I'm changing.
I've always been a really basic, functional cook. Big stews and casseroles to feed big families.
This is a sophisticated version of what I would normally cook.
Sardines with salsa verde and a salad. Rack of lamb, mashed potato.
Are these two dishes enough? Are they good enough?
You can ask that question. It's what I want to cook, cos it's what I want to eat.
It's what I really like to eat.
We are seeing food from Sharon that she truly loves to eat.
Rack of lamb, herb crust, mashed potato.
But, Sharon, where's the sauce?
That lamb is going to be dry as anything without a decent sauce.
You are halfway. Half an hour left.
Justin, what are your two dishes today?
Today, I'm cooking for you pea and mint soup, as a starter,
and the main course is a fillet of beef on a potato base
with all manner of lovely winter veg.
  There aren't enough things on this table for you to do a silly Justin decoration.
  Exactly.
Less is more. That's what I'm learning so far.
Do you think you may have got it right just at the right time?
I want to win this competition. I want you to guide me along.
My worst nightmare is being in the final with Colin. Up against my partner. That would be tough.
It's where the emotional warfare would really start.
Today, I'm going to strip it back.
Bare bones. No fuss. No pomp. No ceremony.
Just good quality, well cooked food.
Justin is doing a fillet of beef with accompanying vegetables.
John, we're used to seeing him over decorate.
But has he gone the other way? Is he going too simple?
25 minutes, guys. 25 minutes left.
  Danny, what are you making for us?
  Raspberry souffles.
I'm just starting on the fish dish   halibut with some capers,
nutty butter, stuff like that, on a bed of kale.
Souffles? Danny, how risky is that?
I made it twice before. Once it didn't work. Once it's worked.
It's a pretty strong recipe. It should stand up. So, we'll see.
If they've not risen, you'll be standing there with your trousers down.
Well, it won't be the first time.
How big are your MasterChef ambitions?
They are to get into the semi finals, which I'd love to do.
If I can pull this one off, I've got a chance.
As a Spurs fan, you're used to disappointment. How will you feel if you go home today?
I'd be really gutted.
Danny's doing raspberry souffles for dessert. That really worries me.
There's no making that good. They either work or they don't.
I think that's risky.
It's a bit of a gamble, the first time I'm cooking my own food.
If you don't take chances, your food's going to be a bit bland.
Come on, boys and girls! Four minutes!
Two minutes to get your food on the plates.
You've got one minute! Come on!
Mate, you've got to get that food up now and I mean right now!
Come on, come on! Let's go!
Time's up! Stop.
Please, cos you're now running over. It's taking the mickey out of the other contestants.
That's it, Colin. You need to stop. Stop!
Colin's main course is chicken stir fry on a bed of lettuce
with chives and soy sauce.
His dessert is deep fried, battered, coconut chocolate bar with mango ice cream
and raspberry sauce.
There isn't a great deal to it. It's very pleasant.
It's fried chicken. There's pork in there as well and sweet onion.
It is street food, but it seems a bit one dimensional to me.
Sure. OK.
I really like that sticky chicken. Very salty but sweet.
I think it's a really good dish. If you hadn't got in a flap, it would have been a wonderful dish.
This is what's causing you so much concern   your dessert.
Cos it is supposed to have mango, chocolate on there and a raspberry coulis as well.
You just completely ran out of time and I had to stop you.
I couldn't get the batter right for the tempura and everything failed after that.
That is very inventive and that is fun.
That is a great deal of fun on a plate.
That ice cream does taste fruity and it's light.
But the star of the show is that chocolate and sweetened coconut in a crispy wrapper.
I think that is great!
You'll never ever sway me from saying
that deep frying and battering a chocolate bar is the right thing to do.
Ever.
Let's be fair, this really doesn't demonstrate your full potential.
Sharon has made a starter of sardines with salsa verde
and rocket and tomato salad.
Her main course is herb crusted rack of lamb
with mashed potato, green beans, vine tomatoes
and spots of lamb sauce.
I think the rich strength of the sardines with the sourness and sharpness of tomato
and the sharpness of your green sauce works very well.
But, to me, a sardine like that needs to be chargrilled.
It needs a bitter finish to give it more of a flow.
Mm! Mm!
Yummy! Really, really yummy.
It's all very light and fresh, but still big on flavour.
I don't mind telling you, I really, really like that.
Sharon, from your sardines to your very nice rack of lamb.
Your mash is a bit grainy and a little bit under seasoned.
But with the freshness of the green beans, beautifully cooked lamb, that wonderful herby crust,
it's a really lovely thing to eat. I really like it.
But your sauce hasn't worked. It almost looks like a sneeze.
It's nicely made. It tastes nice. To take it beyond nice,
it needs something else and that is a sauce.
Yeah.
Justin's made a starter of pea and mint soup with crispy prosciutto
and creme fraiche.
His main course is fillet steak with dauphinoise potatoes,
baked carrots and shallots,
pan fried beans with almonds and a beef sauce.
I really love that. I love the texture.
I like that there's bits of pea. I like that it's not smooth.
That is lovely. And there's not a sparkler or anything silly to spoil it.
  Well done!
  This is food unplugged by me now.
  Hallelujah!
  Thank you very much for that.
I find the mint a little bit sweet, but it's a good bowl of soup.
No denying it. Good bowl of soup. I quite like it.
  Thank you.
  That's your soup. Let's try your beef.
Again, I like the way your food's going. I like the look of this.
Bravo! Bravo! Wonderful.
That beef is lovely. That sauce is a knockout.
BUT too much garlic and it hasn't cooked out of your potatoes.
And it's very strong.
I don't like the charred, burnt flavour of your green beans.
But the rest of your dish looks like good food and it tastes like good food.
It's well seasoned.
It's well thought out, well cooked. Your sauce is lovely and rich and goes beautifully with the beef.
  It's a very good dish, Justin.
  Wow!
  Very good.
  Thank you.
Danny's main course is pan fried halibut with clams
on a bed of kale with a caper and parsley butter sauce.
His dessert is raspberry souffle with a raspberry sauce.
Your fish is cooked beautifully.
Your kale is lovely and soft. Your clams are wonderful.
I think you have overdone it on the seasoning.
Saying that, I love the concept of the dish. Good job, Danny.
Now that's delicious. That is absolutely delicious.
That fish is strong and it's meaty and there is butteriness from your sauce.
There's also a bit of acidity. That's really good, Danny. Honestly, really good.
  Thanks.
  Let's move on from your halibut to your souffle.
What do I say about it really? It's a raspberry souffle.
A bit of raspberry sauce.
Faultless.
Absolutely faultless.
Your souffle itself is light and fluffy with that wonderful crust.
It's risen perfectly. It's a very lovely, well executed, beautifully cooked dish.
Thanks very much.
That is good! That's really good.
That souffle just disappears and leaves a hint of fruit and sugar on your tongue.
That's really good, Danny. That's accomplished cooking, mate. Really accomplished.
Thank you very much. That was great. Off you go.
I couldn't get the batter right for the tempura.
Mine went all right, I guess, but I feel sorry for Colin.
Not "sorry" but I feel for Colin because I know how he feels.
  I'm looking at you and it makes me cry.
  Everyone's in tears.
Today, there was one person who truly shined.
  Danny.
  Oh,wow!
Danny played with fire today and he didn't get burnt.
The souffle   perfect. Absolutely perfect.
Oh, mate! He's on fire.
Let's both agree he stays in the competition.
It was fairly mind blowing to get such good comments from John and Gregg.
I knew the souffle, if it came off, was quite sexy.
Pink, fluffy clouds, which my kids like as well.
Justin   what a surprise. He is listening.
Pea and mint soup   I think the soup itself was a bit sweet.
But lovely, really lovely. The main course with the fillet of beef.
It wasn't garnished with silly things,
like a pina colada, four slices of pineapple and a Carmen Miranda hat.
It was actually what it should have been.
What's really nice today, for me,
is being told my cooking is coming on. I did rein it in and they seem to think it worked.
So brilliant.
Danny is obviously going through.
I think Justin should join him.
  Agreed.
  Good.
  Colin.
The chicken dish was lovely and tasty.
Really good balance, but Colin got in a tiz.
His chocolate bars stuck to the bottom of the frying basket. Everything started to go wrong.
His dessert did not come off. It didn't work.
But I loved the ambition and the fun of his dessert.
Up to this stage, Colin has had a pretty good competition.
I think he's courageous and he understands good flavour combinations.
It's natural that you want to do your best.
I was so panicked during that.
I think I'm a bit disappointed actually.
I really, really love Sharon's sardines. I think it was great.
Sharon's sardines were nice, but they should have been charred.
The lamb dish, again, was nice, but it seemed a little bit unambitious to me.
If I'm out today,
I'm like, "It's because they don't think I've got the potential."
Yeah, I'll be disappointed.
We now have to decide between Colin and Sharon.
What do we do?
The person leaving us...
Is...
Colin.
Thanks, Colin.
Gorgeous.
Well done, Juz.
  Love your ambition, Coll. Love it!
  Thank you.
It was the chocolate bars.
Wasn't it? It was a step too far.
It would have been nice to have gone through,
but alas 'twas not to be.
Well done, mate.
I am actually proud of myself and in shock. I've gone through. It's like unreal.
I want to do as well as I possibly can for Colin as well.
And I'd be really proud to do that.
I'm over the moon to go through. Hopefully, I've got loads more to give.
Tomorrow, the battle intensifies,
as these three celebrities fight to stay in the competition.
I've got the scallops ready. I need my tortelli, please.
How do I know if it's cooked? Will somebody check?
I'm nervous.
Four starters of the day! Four asparagus, my friend.
Two, no eggs! Quick, quick!
I need the octopus on the pass!
Danny, come here.
Look at this! They're dry! They're no good!
Come on, do it again. Quick!
