and that arrogance you have in the The European eel has one of the
most fascinating lifestyles of any freshwater fish. They migrate
thousands of miles and their offspring return to Scotland. The
little eels can find big obstacles in their way. When it comes to
great swimmers, forget the great white shark. Forget the Atlantic
salmon. You can even forgets Olympic hopeful Hannah Miley. If
you want efficient swimmers, what about the European eel, it can swim
4,500 miles burning up 2000 calories. That is less than I eat
in a day. And I am not greedy. The eels make their once in a lifetime
swim back to their spawning ground in the sea. After spawning, the
eels die off and their rates drift backwards towards Europe and the
Gulf Stream, transforming into transparent glass eels on the way.
When they enter freshwater, they change colour and become elvers.
Later, they mature into eels. Since the 70s, eel numbers have dropped
dramatically. By about 90%. The reason for the decline is complex
but overfishing, pollution, climate change and obstacles on the return
journey play a part. Imagine you are a little Elva, you have fought
through wild currents, swum across thousands of miles of ocean and
battled away up streams and rivers, you are weary but close to your
That is it, your journey is over. This is Tongland damn. Since it was
built, no eels have made it past this. It has a fish ladder but eels
are not able to use it. So, Galloway Fisheries Trust are
trapping the elvers and relocating them upstream. The young elvers
cannot get up, and whilst it is good for salmon to get past, their
strong swimmers. The eels have come in at seven metres long. We are
checking the traps. The eels are attracted to the water, they make
their way up and drop into the container. It is a very simple trap.

Well, these elvers are destined to go to war with an alien species.
people know, we have the largest crayfish population in Scotland
around Loch Ken. One of the key things we have found in Dumfries
and Galloway is the eels are a key predator of the very young fish.
There is a huge problem in the river of rapidly expanding crayfish
population. It is not a silver bullets but we hope the eel
population when it is established will help to control the crayfish.
The signal crayfish damage riverbanks by borrowing and they
eat and displace native Scottish species. So, the elvers have an
important war to wage. Why have you chosen this bird? We chose this
because it is clear water, no pollution, lots of different sizes
of stones. A range of eels so they want to bury underneath all buried

Whisky is Scotland's number one export. The value of sales abroad
is growing by a quarter in the first six months of this year. Nick
will be meeting some of the people who make the industry tick. This
week, drinking with a man who has a million pound knows.
We becomes to whisky, I am a mild man, but 8% of all whiskies are
single malt. The other 92% is blended. That is why I am
travelling to the 9th floor of the Whyte & Mackay building to meet a
man who can convey any with my own blended whisky. Level nine. Richard,
a nice to meet you. Welcome to the world of whisky. It is part
Aladdin's cave, part laboratory. This is a treasure chest weather
lovely blended whiskies and single malts are put together. There are
four regions, the lowlands, Highlands, Campbeltowns and islands.
Single malts come from these areas but different characteristics. They
blend them together, mixing grain whisky and malt whisky together,
pure harmony. The industry is having a renaissance. It is really
going great guns. They renew Distilleries opening. You have
whetted my appetite. I am salivating at the prospect. Where
do we start? Over here. Legon, maestro.    lead
on. Everything is monitored, we start with grain whiskies. We're
not talking about one or two, maybe 20 or 25 single malts. It is
fascinating to see how it is developing. Now, this is from this
base side valley. Let's see how it is manipulated. Now, we want to
finish off with a backbone, structure and the arrogance you
have in the kitchen. Let me put one or two more in. Lots of different
styles. This is alchemy, pure and simple. See the body and structure?

is 56.5% alcohol, strong and beefy. This will aid with distinguished

flavours and smells in this blended whisky, I have to confess I am a

I have been sailing around the Hebrides for 30 years. I have never
run aground before. But the one time I have a slight collision with

could continue on our journey. That is asked sailing, this Gomis behind

This is getting better, look at Eigg, chunks of sunshine and on the
mainland horrible. Where we are In 1997, Eigg was bought by the
community, a trust to run the island for the islanders. One of
the first things on the agenda were setting up a reliable electricity
system. There was no system, no connection to the mainland and
everybody made their own electricity. For most people, they
could only have power in the evening hours of darkness.
islands now has a sophisticated system of wind, Soler and a big
bank of batteries. What happens when you generate more than you
need? Just renewables, you never get 24 hour power because they will
be periods when the sun does not shy, when the wings does not know
and when the rain does not fall. We back the system up with a bank of
batteries, 96 of them, when there is less power being produced by the
renewables, than the islanders can see me, power flows out of the
batteries into the grid to make a difference. When there is a surplus
the Powell flowed back into the batteries to recharge them. People
come from all around the world to study the electric system. Schemes
like this are bringing folk back to the island to stay. Since the
islanders bought by the community, the population has grown. From 60
in 1997, to around 90 people today. They're not just older people
looking for an idyllic place to retire, many of the people coming
here are young folk. They are Sarah Boden spent part of her child

music journalist in London but she has given up the bright lights to
become a farmer on new. It has been a steep learning curve.    A farmer
on that Eigg. I have learned to work. I have got two sheepdogs.
There are two other farmers on the island who are very helpful and
also on the Island of Muck, so I can ring them up and ask advice if
I am struggling. But I am doing things like fence building and
repairing, which is going to take at least five or six years to help
get the basic infrastructure up to speed. Next stop, we are aiming for
the Island of Muck. But you will be glad to hear we are not planning to

is sensational! What about the prospects for this weekend and
Hello. A windy weekend across most parts of the country and a wet
weekend for some of us. Here is the synoptic chart for tomorrow. We had
some heavy fabrics of rain across the Western Isles and into western
coastal areas. Strong winds tomorrow morning and through much
of the day. Through parts of Aberdeenshire and parts of the east
coast, it will be a dry day. The rain is coming your way later on.
Across the south, highs of 12 degrees. The rain is working into a
share and the north west. The north east is strange drier and
brighter for longer. Behind that weather front, it is starting to
Brighton. If you are walking or climbing, it will be wet. A
southerly wind direction of around 40 mph and a steady speed. In the
east, it will be drier but the winds will be stronger. It will be
strong enough to blow you from your feet as it gets up to 80 mph. A
rough sea state with the moderate visibility and there will be rain.
In the Firth of Forth, gale force three to play the    to force for.
Into the evening and overnight, the rain shifts, leaving it dry and
calm. As we move into Sunday, the pressure chart shows we are
starting to get an area of low pressure off the south coast of
Ireland. Its associated weather front are working their way up to
us. In Caithness and Sutherland, dry, fine and even bright but the
rain is moving in from the south with some strong winds. It will be
staying breezy and even a windy for the next few days. To start next
week, we can see the low pressure continuing to move north. Tight
isobars, so pretty strong winds. The rain confined to western parts
of the country and elsewhere it is dry. Come Tuesday, the weather
front is working its way further inland, so more rain for most of us
and the rain will be heavy and slow moving. The Met Office has issued a
yellow alert because we could see some localised flooding. The dark

processed in Scotland comes from hardwoods such as oak. Most of the
oak, ash, elm and birch is exported or used for firewood. In the final
part of my series looking at our native woodlands, I have been at
the Borders company set up to use these trees to make furniture. This
week, I am at Real Wood Studios near Jedburgh, where something like
this becomes something like this all in one site   and it is all
done with sustainability in mind. Real Wood Studios is a whole but
for furniture makers to run their own businesses within a collective
workshop. We work from a log coming in through the saw mill and we have
our own drying system, and we also have the next stage from that which
turns it into furniture. It is a treat to table operation. The ethos
of the place is to use locally sourced to timber. Real Wood
Studios was set up by Borders Forest Trust to combine the talents
of young furniture designers with undervalued native hardwoods. How
important are these native hardwoods to Scotland's economy?
They are very important but they make up a very small percentage of
water that we grow and produce   less than 10%. A lot of the hard
words that we do produce get processed elsewhere it, so it does
have the potential to be a great economic boom that for local
communities and businesses like Real Wood Studios. People think
about it in terms of green issues and environmental cost, and for us
we have this resource   are some great old trees   and we prefer
using the ones we have got rather than importing from overseas.
is the attraction for you to work here? It is about creating things,
to be honest. It is about taking a blank canvas and creating something
which is going to be functional and loved by the owner, and which is
going to last for generations. It is the antidote to mass produced
furniture, I suppose. The majority of the furniture made at Real Wood
Studios is sold right here, but the best thing   apart from the beauty
of the word   is that every piece of wood comes from a tree less than
50 miles away. These are fantastic words. An oak
tree grows for 50 years and though it deems it is going to produce on
the furniture is going to become an heirloom. It is a fantastic product
rather than a quick, throwaway product. We should be making the
Ticks by a real problem for anyone who spends time outside, but for
shooting estates they can have a real impact on the local impact.
Sarah is finding out what it can be done to control these harmful bugs.
Anyone who is frequently in the great outdoors knows what can be
lurking in the undergrowth. These nasty bloodsuckers are waiting to
pounce and cling on for life. The effects of tick Looe can be
devastating, as Jane Thomson found out three years ago. She contracted
to Lymes disease from one single tick bite. It affected my movement.
It affected my legs, which were very painful when I could feel them
  sometimes they were not really there. The best way to describe it
is that it felt like there were aliens inside my legs, running up
and down, which is the nerve activity. I was extremely tired and
was slipping for about 14 hours a day. I had no energy, no strength
and could only walk up half the stairs without having to stop and
have a rest. But they are not just a problem for us humans and our
dogs. By anys can contain    can cause havoc for all types of
wildlife that stumble across them. This can be a problem for estates
that rely on a good number of chicks every year. This man has
been the head keeper for Gannochy Estate 40 years and has seen the
damage they can cause. The highest number I have counted on a grouse
chick was 147 on a four day old chick. There is no way the chick
can survive. To control it is a major thing. You might not know
this, but the tick is part of the spider family. It is a cross
between a spider and a vampire. Not the most endearing combination, but
what do we do about these gritters? The key is to find out how they
operate.    critters. David in bushes and a long grass and wait
for possible prey to pass. In this case, an unsuspecting runner. The
tick has no eyes but has a highly developed sense in hits    in its
legs. It is just a matter of waiting for the right time to
attack. Laura Taylor is a scientist
specialising in ticks and she has been researching the effectiveness
of sheep as pest control. She has been sweeping this Angus Campbell
land with her blanket, accounting tick numbers. We normally leave it
out for 10 metres and usually it is a slow walking pace to mimic a
sheep going through the heather. Just stop. Turn the blanket over
and have a look. We will see if we can find any ticks. We have got one
here. This is quite a small one. It is a middle sized tick that you get.
We have got some examples of some other ticks. I can hardly even see
this! This is an adult female here. You can see that is a lot bigger.
Unfortunately, the tick not only sexual Blood but its saliva can
carry a range of diseases.    socks your blood. When treated with
pesticides, they can help to kill these nasty beasts.
By gather these sheep are part of the tick solution. A Yes, we use
them as tick mops on the hill. We treat them with acaricide and treat
them on the hill and as they move around, the ticks jump on to them
sheep mopping can be effective, it depends on the local circumstances.
For victims like Jane, a solution to the tick problem could not come
too soon. So, 3, four years on, how are you
feeling? I would say 90% better. Still quite a week in my legs. I am
fine walking on flat surfaces but as soon as I go up hill, I have no
power at all. I am not sleeping so much and I have got more energy and
I can walk. I have done two sponsored walks this year, so I am
better than I was. As it stopped you from going out and enjoying the
outdoors and the countryside? just check myself very carefully
and night and make sure I have got no ticks. It should be noted that
not every tick bide will result in Lymes disease, but there are some
things you can do to reduce the risk. Wear trousers and tuck them
into socks. Avoid overhanging vegetation. Use a repellent. Carry
very top of its head. Do not squash or burn the tick, because this
could cause them to regurgitate back into your body. If you did
develop a rash and start to feel unwell, call your GP.
The ongoing battle against the dreaded tick. As the clock ticks
towards the end of the programme, I have time to tell you what is
coming up next week. A Sarah finds out about the
challenges of setting up a deer farm. Experts say we should be
producing an extra 100,000 tonnes a deer. If that was to come from the
farming sector, we would need about 500 new farms. And our reporter is
up against the clock on his sailing adventure. Hart is thumping a bit
coming in here! It is quite straightforward but some of the
