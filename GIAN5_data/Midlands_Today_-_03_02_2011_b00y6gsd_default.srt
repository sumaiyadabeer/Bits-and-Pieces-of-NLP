City speed cameras set to be switched off to save cash, amid
warnings it could lead to more road accidents.
We will see speeds rise, the number of crashes go up and the number of
people killed and injured go up. A hospital's neglect contributed to

Midlands Today from the BBC. Tonight:
Is it the end of the road for speed cameras?
At the moment, there are 304 fixed speed cameras in place across
Birmingham, Coventry and the Black Country. They face being switched
off from April to save money. It is happening because the Government
afford the £1.9 million a year it costs to run them. Police say they
are concerned, and road safety groups claim it could lead to a big
rise in deaths on our roads. Bob Hockenhull reports.
They are meant to reduce road casualties. Now they themselves are
a casualty of the spending cuts. All of the speed cameras in the
West Midlands could be turned off on April 1st to save money. The
police fear the worst. I believe if safety cameras are not operating,
there will be an increase in speeding vehicles, and probably an
increase in collisions and casualties, unfortunately.
seven councils in the West Midlands are reducing the amount they pay
have not cooperated with their efforts to try to reduce costs.
think they have gone about it entirely wrong. There was a good
partnership going with the police, the fire service and all of the
councils and the West Midlands. They have now jeopardised that by
standing alone, in my opinion. the police say that without council
funding they simply cannot afford to keep the cameras on. The fear is
that drivers will be cheering from the rafters if the cameras
disappear, but most people we spoke to don't want them to go. Speed
cameras to save a lot of lives. No, I am against that. It is a bad
thing, really. Speed cameras are there for a reason, so we should
keep them. It is a money making scheme, don't you think? Of the 304
fixed cameras in the West Midlands, only about 100 are in operational
service. The rest are a deterrent. But how much of a deterrent will
they be if none are operating? The police say they will just have to
rely on mobile speed cameras instead.
Our transport correspondent Peter Plisner joins us now from a street
where there is a camera that could be switched off. Peter, they cost a
lot of money. How likely is it that all these cameras will be switched
off? It is a definite possibility. There
is a bit of political posturing going on, the councils want more
money from the government for road safety, or want the police to
reduce the fee they charge for enforcing the cameras. If neither
of those things happen, we will see cameras switched off. Some drivers
will be happy about that, but some are concerned. Among some, Kevin
Clinton from RoSPA. Our worries are that if cameras are switched off,
speeds will go up, and the number of people killed and injured will
rise. Cameras have been switched off in Oxford and Swindon, and
there has not been a rise in accidents, so is it an issue?
early days in Oxfordshire and Swindon had few cameras, but the
research shows cameras are effective at saving lives. The
Major report said that they saved around 100 lives per year. Last
year, the RAC published a report suggesting that if we did not have
cameras there would be 800 more deaths and injuries on the roads
every year. The council say they could do it cheaper with other
methods? It is right to use a mix of Mathers, cameras are not the
only tool, the electronic signs that we see a useful, but cameras
are very useful and should be spared. Ironically, these could be
switched off on April 1st, April Fool's Day, but we are told that
there will be talks tomorrow between the council and police, so
let's hope that resolves the situation and they do not have to
take the drastic move of switching off the cameras.
A coroner is to write to a health watchdog citing neglect as a
contributory factor in the death of another patient at a Birmingham
Health Trust. Betty Vaughan was given an insulin overdose that put
her into a diabetic coma from which she never properly recovered.
Nurses at the Good Hope Hospital were also criticised during an
inquest which finished today. Our health correspondent Michele
Paduano reports. She arranged her own 80th birthday
party and looked after her elder sister, but when Betty Vaughan went
into Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield with an infection, she
never came out. She was not able to feed herself, she could not give
herself a drink, she never walked again. And when they sat her out in
a chair later on, she fell out of the chair, she fell out of the bed.
Mrs Vaughan was a diabetic, but her family discovered that she had been
given two doses of insulin within four hours, despite the first dose
being shown on her drugs chart. Sister Amanda Ware was dismissed by
Heart of England NHS Trust. She had previously been off sick with
Our mother was in a terrible condition for 109 days after the
overdose, and for many of those days she was in great pain and
suffering because of all of the added medical conditions that came
up that they should have spotted. Mrs Vaughan's wasn't the first
drug related death at the Trust. In 2006, Steve Parkin was given the
wrong drug. In 2007, Baljit Singh Sunner and Paul Richards were given
10 times the dose of a cancer drug. In 2008, Rosemary Mcfarlane's lungs
burned away due to five times the dose of a buffer solution. The
coroner said he would write to the Care Quality Commission to say that
the debt had been contributed to by neglect. What he did not say that  
  was that in a couple of weeks' time there will be an inquest into
the death of a woman whose death was possibly caused by a drug used
on death row. We will try to make sure this never happens again.
seems like a good verdict, but it won't bring mum back. Since Mrs
Vaughan's death, the Trust says it has invested in more qualified
nurses on the wards. All nurses are West Midlands Ambulance Service has
spent half a million pounds on new equipment to help deal with
overweight patients. The money has been spent on four specially
adapted ambulances which can safely carry people who weigh up to 43
stone. The news comes after a study labelled Birmingham and the Black
Country as the obesity capital of Europe.
A few years ago, probably only 10 years ago, the average patient was
12 or 13 stone. Now that is probably 17 or 18 stone, and we
regularly see patients up to 30 stones in weight.
The head of an illegal car clamping company has been jailed for 30
months today. Steven Ryan, who ran Car Clamping Securities, defrauded
motorists by tampering with a pay  and display machine at a Birmingham
car park. It was fitted with a computer chip so that it accepted
coins and issued a ticket, but no credit was given to the driver.
Some had to pay £300 to get their car back.
You are watching Midlands Today from the BBC. Thanks for joining us.
Still to come this evening: Safely home from the violence in
Egypt, a businessman is reunited The former Labour MP for Stafford,
David Kidney, has been giving evidence today to the inquiry into
the unexpected deaths of patients at Stafford Hospital.
Health campaigners had criticised Mr Kidney when he was in office,
saying he did not act swiftly enough when they raised concerns
with him. Our reporter Liz Copper joins us now from Stafford. What
happened at the inquiry? We have heard all day from David
Kidney, who was the MP for Stafford between 1997 and last May, when he
lost his seat. He began by giving details of the background to how
the hospital obtained trust status. He said it was something he had
mixed feelings about politically and practically. Practically, he
had concerns over the hospital's finances and staffing levels. Next,
he talked about his constituents who came to see him with concerns
about the standards of care at a hospital, in particular a letter
from Julie Bailey, the woman who came to be the lead falls in the
campaign over what happened at the hospital. He was shown the letter
and felt shocked when he read it, saying it was stark and unusual. He
was asked by the chairman about his reply and said, my tone should have
been different. After he gave evidence, I asked him whether his
response should have been different. There are things, looking back,
that more attention earlier would have helped, but the crucial thing
was to have the evidence of the proper clinical investigation by
the regulator, and it was when that was published in March 2009 that we
all had the evidence, the shocking evidence, that traction    drastic
action was needed. What have the campaigners said? Throughout this,
they have made no secret that they have not been impressed by Declan
Kidney    to Mr Key the's response. I asked Julie Bailey for her
thoughts. Why didn't he challenged the response and the information he
was given? Why didn't you recognise the complaints? He didn't listen to
any of the constituents that were telling him it was not safe for
vulnerable patients. Julie Bailey, speaking to me this evening.
Tomorrow, the inquiry is due did hear from Stafford's current MP,
the Conservative MP who won the seat from David Kidney. After that,
the MP for Stone will give evidence. But it will be weeks, possibly
months, before we hear from ministers at the time about what
they knew about what happened at Stafford Hospital.
This copper, thank you.    Liz Copper.
It was the worst natural disaster to hit Pakistan. The floods last
August affected a huge population, estimated at more than 20 million
people. One village was destroyed in the
flood waters, and money raised here has helped rebuild it. As a result
it has been renamed... The Midlands Village.
In the first of our series Dealing With Disaster, our special
correspondent Peter Wilson has been to see how the money was spent.
Pakistan... For those with Western eyes, it can seem an alien culture.
A breeding ground for terrorism, a hothouse for extremism. Our guide
is Mohammed Aslam. He is a member of the Order of the British Empire.
A retired Walsall bus driver, he is the driving force behind a charity
helping people in disaster areas. When I first came here, there were
no houses at all, everything was destroyed. I was told that the
water was at 9, 10 feet. Everything was demolished. He saw to it that,
in August, £80,000 was used to set up tents and food for villagers in
the Punjab. I was there when he returned to one place destroyed in
the flood, now renamed the Midlands Village. 35 homes have been built.
People here had lost everything when the flood waters came. 16 ft
of water, there was nothing to be seen, no sheep, goats, everything,
our beds. Nothing of ours was here. Just us and our children, we were
saving our lives. Mohammed Aslam and his team are seen as life
savers. they provided us with
many things, so now we are happy, we can start our life. Walsall
charity may have given them the suppliers, but the villagers
themselves are rebuilding their homes. This land near Multan was
once a prosperous fish farming area. Stone schools were washed away. So,
too, the fish in the ponds. This man is struggling, they're asking
him for money, and he has none. They don't know what to do. In the
UK, the police and politicians try to promote ways of discouraging
extremism. Mohammed Aslam and the Midlands International Aid Trust
appear to be winning hearts and minds. In villages here, schools
are teaching hope and inspiration. The flowers on the garments are
dying now, but everything that has been achieved here at the Midland
School will last for many years ahead.
That money has made such a different.
He is a remarkable man, as well. And there will be more reports from
Peter Wilson's trip to Pakistan on Midlands Today tomorrow, and on
Monday. There is also more at BBC.co.uk/Birmingham.
As fuel prices continue to rise, there has been a big increase in
the number of thefts of heating oil across the region. Organised gangs
equipped with pumps and storage containers are especially targeting
rural areas. Police are urging people to be on
their guard and to improve their security measures to protect an
increasingly precious commodity. From Herefordshire, Andy Newman
reports. Remote, valuable and vulnerable.
Heating oil has become hot property in the countryside. This tank
belongs to an activity centre in Herefordshire. The manager only
partly fills up now so he does not use an entire tankful. We have been
hit six times, and we have had to have no heating. Sometimes that has
been for two weeks, at its worst. Also, in the Stapleton Road we had,
the building was really cold    in the snow weather that we had.
Thieves have been hiding cans in secret locations, then returning at
night, filling up and driving off. The number of incidents in
Herefordshire has risen from one, two a week, to one or two a day.
The people targeting domestic fuel, or Farm fuel, are organised, they
have got the pomps and the tanks, and the crime can be acted out very
quick it. It is a big problem for anyone who lives out in the country.
We rely on this seat    this heat source to eat the home with a oil.
You have to spend a lot of money to try to secure were an exposed tank,
but they will find a way in. advice to people in rural areas is
to try to improve security around the tank, and to report any
suspicious activity to the police immediately, otherwise your oil
could be used to heat someone else's home.
We have been hearing a lot about library closures and cuts recently,
but in Birmingham things are heading in the other direction.
Work on the city's new Central Library is ahead of schedule, and
today those who cannot wait got a chance to see how the inside will
look when it is finished. Our arts reporter Lindsey Doyle joins us now
from the site. What did you see today?
This morning, we were shown a virtual reality video, a flight
through of what the new library will look like inside. I have to
say, it is looking pretty impressive. We were shown each
level on the video, culminating in the golden Rotunda, which will be
at the top of the building. That will house the remarkable
Shakespeare collection we have in this city, from the Shakespeare
Memorial Room at the original Victorian library. We also looked
at the children's section, looked at the wonderful and the theatre we
will have here. That virtual reality video is available on our
website and also on Birmingham Library's website. The hoardings
here have become a familiar sight, but you may notice we have them now
right across the Red Theatre, because that has been closed for
major refurbishment as well    the Birmingham repertory Theatre. We
were then taken behind the scenes of the new building, and,
considering just a year ago we were looking at a hole in the ground, it
is incredible how quickly the building is being directed. I am
told it is ahead of shade too and we are looking at achieving the
target of opening in June the 2013    ahead of schedule.
We are here rings so much about cuts at the moment, how does the
council justified this?    hearing so much.
The money for the library was ring  fenced before the change of
government, before the cuts were implemented, but it was a question
I put to the leader of Birmingham City Council.
If you want to know about the great British industrial revolution, our
archives habit. James Watt's first sketch for a cattle, we have the
original, and everybody in Birmingham, in the United Kingdom,
and, we hope, globally, can come in and see what this library has to
offer. Things are looking rosy for the
Central Library, but what about others across the region?
In the last 24 hours we had Warwickshire County Council are
looking at cutting 16 libraries, possibly. A further three looking
at reduced opening hours, and we have heard a lot about protesters
in Gloucestershire recently fighting to save library is there.
But I understand no decision has been made on smaller libraries in
Birmingham as the act. OK, thank you very much indeed.   
as yet. A family has been reunited after
escaping the violence in Egypt. You may remember we spoke to Kate
Phillips earlier this week after she got herself and her children
out of the country. Now husband Rick has been able to join them.
Meanwhile, for people here who have family in Egypt, it is a worrying
time as the fighting and disorder intensifies. Cath Mackie reports.
All night? Thank you very much. Guards at the gates to fight off
looters, and tanks outside the compound where he lives. Rick
Phillips films his last few days in Egypt before he manages to get on a
flight back to the UK. I got back last night, it is nice to be back.
The whole week has been a bit of a shock. Events unfolded pretty
quickly, and it is hard to forget. On Tuesday, Midlands Today filmed
Rick's wife Kate and their children in Fladbury in Worcestershire,
where they waited anxiously for his return. They had managed to get on
an earlier flight. And today, reunited, the relief is clear.
Lovely! It is really lovely. We have waited a long time for this,
and it is nice to be all together again. But it is a different story
for Motaz Attallah, an engineering lecturer at Birmingham University.
His parents and brothers are in Cairo, but after days without news
he has finally heard they are safe. The fact there was an internet
blackout made it feel there was something major happening, because
to blackout the internet as well as telephone communication, you think
something horrible is happening and they want to hide it. I heard today
that a close friend of one of my relatives died in the
demonstrations. So, in general, in my family, they are keeping away
from everything, so they are safe at the moment. The demonstration of
20,000 people... The Phillips, too, are in constant contact with
friends and colleagues in Cairo. We have huge gangs of people trying to
break into houses. With no security, householders are going on to the
streets, forming cordons to try to keep these people away. The family
is hoping it will be safe enough for them to return home to Egypt
next week. Good to see them back together. A
happy end to that. If you are a Wolves fan, you might
want to look away now. Here is the sport with dance.    Dan.
Wolves have dropped to the bottom of the Premier League after
suffering an agonising defeat last night. They lost 1 0 at Bolton
after a defensive howler from Ronald Zubar. Manager Mick McCarthy
Ronald Zubar. Manager Mick McCarthy hands. It ended in a state of
disbelief. And the result leaves Wolves bottom of the Premier League.
Things would have been so different if Matt Jarvis had converted his
early chance. As it was, he produced the heading hands moment.
Wolves also hit a post through Kevin Doyle in the second half. But
it all came to nothing when Ronald Zubar's rush of blood gave Daniel
I feel lousy, I feel robbed, I think we had a point in our pocket
and we have given it away. We scrapped it out as we always do,
and to give away the point in the manner which we have, I don't have
the words to Tania had it makes me feel.    to tell you how it makes
of slow starts. Last night, Carlos Tevez put Manchester City ahead
after four minutes. Nikola Zigic got them back on level terms, but
they were behind again by half time. Not much wrong with Aleksander
Kolarov's free kick, though. So, the Blues were forced into yet
another comeback. Kevin Phillips earned a penalty, and Craig Gardner
smashed it home to keep them just outside the bottom three.
And Stoke City are slipping after losing 2 0 at Liverpool. Raul
Meireles put Liverpool in front. And £23 million new signing Luis
Suarez scored on his debut. Stoke might be 11th, but now they are
just six points above the bottom And Walsall drew 1 1 at Notts
County. Wolves have got Man United did next. It gets worse!
Today sees the launch of this year's Comic Relief appeal. Red
Nose Day in 2009 raised a record  breaking total of over £82 million
to help people in Africa and here in the UK.
Ben Sidwell has been to see a project in Worcestershire which has
benefited from the money raised two years ago.
Preparing for another service at the Caring Hands in the Vale Diner
in Evesham. For the past six years, these volunteers have been serving
up hot meals twice a week for those in town who need them most. Over
the past year, the project has been paid for by a grant from Comic
Relief of just £2,500. Having the ground that has paid to run the
diner for a year has really helped us, not having to worry about
whether money is coming from.    where the money is coming from.
man who has been coming here for the past five years is Anthony
Dorsett. All his life, he had wanted to join the Army, and signed
up at the age of 15. But when he was medically discharged less than
three years later, his world began to fall apart. As you could see,
there are flats here now, but before there was a small shed, and
I slept there were four about six, seven months.    slept there rough.
Although he is currently living at a bed and breakfast in the town,
Anthony has spent most of his five years in Evesham homeless, and, due
to a lack of work and money, he could soon be back on the streets.
If I do not get the help I need, I could end up doing that again.

who needs a hot meal. The ship is a market town, it is not an inner 
city area, but it shows you there is a need in every community

Midlands who Comic Relief have helped, and he has got a simple
message for anybody who has donated money. The Comic Relief grant runs
