On today's Blue Peter: Will we survive a night in a haunted
castle? Do you dare to eat these spooky
sweet treats? And are these little critters as
scary as they look? It's a Hallowe'en special, only on
Hello! Welcome to a pumpkintastic Hallowe'en on Blue Peter! Take a
look at this. I fold we were all dressing up. It is quite hard to
move in this thing. We couldn't have a pumpkin show in the garden
without getting a monster one in. There are just a few of these grown
in this country. In 1981 the was a massive pumpkin that was grown. The
owner kept the seed and every giant pumpkin to Derry is a descendant of
that huge pumpkin. That is impressive. But Halloween is not
all about pumpkins. Over 2000 years ago in Ireland Celtic farmers
believed it was the day when the season of life meant this season of
death. They called it summer's end. They held a large festival and
disguised themselves as ghosts and demons to confuse the spirits they
believed him. Children would also say prayers for the debt in
exchange for coins. By the eight hundreds Christianity had made its
way into Celtic lands and the Pope then established All Hallows Day,
to honour all say this. Soon it became known as All Hallows Eve,
and eventually became Halloween. In the mid  19th century Irish
folklore it was taken across to America where Hallowe'en practice
has changed with the addition of pumpkins. It has now become known
as a time to dress up and scare ourselves silly. In America it is
the most profitable holiday in the calendar any billions of dollars
for shops. Look at these amazing designs. A spider, and our own cat
carved into a pumpkin. David, you are working on a design that we
will reveal later. How do you make such intricate designs? Any picture,
you can simply draw that as it Template. So you would draw
something on to paper and then pin it on to the pumpkin? Yes, I just
pin it on and start to carve through the actual drawing. I think
I do well with a triangle. What do you used to make the details?
we just have a pumpkin carving knife that you can get from shops.
They're designed especially for the job. How did you get into this?
our village we decided to have a pumpkin growing and carbon
competition. I just found that I could do something special. A but
you have done something a bit different. How do you get the
candle in? I always cut the whole from underneath. Then I hollow out
the pumpkin and I can put the candle on the table and place the
pumpkin on top. So that is nice and safe. I'm just trying to deflate
myself! I am not mobile in this think! Went I was younger, by used
to get given at turn up to carve, like this. Where my parents just
being a bit cheaper? They are at a traditional version but the
Americans brought over the modern pumpkin that we have now. They're
so easy to carve. And there are easier to handle. And because their
orange they look so much better. But it is not just turn ups and
pumpkins that you carve? No, you can carve watermelons all year
round for parties or birthdays. Any celebration. The watermelon dos
smell better! It's dollars. definitely better than the smell of
a 10 up! All the pomp that you took out is not going to waste. We will
take that to the kitchen and it will be turned into a sweet treat.
Meanwhile David will be carving his pumpkin and you can get ready for a
fright. We went to Warwick Castle, meant to be one of the most haunted
places in the country, to stay the night. We were in search of a
history expert called John Dulwich. Welcome to Warwick Castle! I know
you like to do things that are daring. Tonight we want to see if
you have got real nerve. We challenge you to spend the night in
the most wanted part of the castle. Let's go! Traditionally home to the
Earls of Warwick, the castle dates back to nine team 41 A D. With
tales of murder and madness, the ghosts stories around the castle
are many and varied and all on their thing. Year in the rose
garden, there is a ghost scene here of a woman in period costume who
wanders around. On winter's nights you can hear the doors of the Ice
House behind us shouting. A bit like that! We're now in the Chinese
bedroom, you will spend the first part of the night in here. A figure
is a bus to be seen in that corner over there. And someone once saw
the hem of a dressed disappearing into the walls. That is the Prince
of Wales behind you. He loved the castle so much he had his own room
year. A number of ghosts haunt this room. In that corner there is
supposed to be a black figure which just appears and disappears. Behind
you, a monkey that used to belong to the owners of the castle.
stories that made us afraid of what might happen in the light. A visit
to have dungeon was about to make things even worse. The main ghost
haunting this part of the castle is called John Smith. He was left down
here in 1642 for three years. Apparently if you look around on
the walls you'll see scratchings on the walls. He did that with his own
fingernails. I was already feeling uneasy when John told us we would
be left alone in the dungeon. touched my head. I did not touch it.
SCREAMING. The bank had to has been a dungeon door slamming but it was
not long before strange things started to happen. That is
definitely moving. I am seeing weird lights. I can't see anything.
It looks like something white. is that? Every sound freaks me out.
Because it is dark your mind starts to play tricks on you. We were not
certain what was real and what was not after 20 minutes we were
desperate to get out. We did not see anything but I was freaked out
when you said it was not you touching my head. I was freaked out
when the door slammed. We kept on thinking that we saw something
floating but I just think it was arm minds. It would be an odd place
to spend the rest of the night so I am glad if we're going back inside.
Back in the Chinese bedroom we still felt uneasy and things were
not going to become any less strange. This is more scary than
the dungeon. The dungeon was pitch black and there was nothing there.
But there are mannequins and screens. The mannequins are quite
scary. I need something to happen to make me believe. That is the
corner where the ghost is supposed to be. This is usually where the
foot... I'm not scared at all but it is really quite nerve racking!
That is only my collar brushing against it. Put your head in the
cupboard. What is that in the corner? I don't know. I know it is
fine. What is that? How do you not see that flickering light? I can't
see anything. Watch, their eighties. I saw something flicker. Did you
really? At the end of the dresser right there. No, there is nothing
there. I don't know how he is as sleek. I'm not scared but I'm
definitely not relaxed. We could not explain the strange lights and
strangely none of our cameras and pick them up. Now feeling spooked
out, it would be be able to cope when we moved to the most haunted
room in the whole castle? I don't know about you but I'm up for this.
But I want something to happen. do want something to happen, but I
feel a bit weird now. I was excited today, but I do feel nervous.
is the monkey. If that landed on your chest and you woke up with
that looking at you in the face, you would be freaked out. Don't
touch it! All the stories we have heard so far... Where you scared?
No, I just did not know what was going on. I'm desperate for the
toilet and can stay here any longer. But walking around the castle is
freaky. Helen and still have gone to the toilet, I think they're
petrified. I am as well because they have left me by myself. This
is the silence, it's everywhere. It is really creepy. You do not know
what is going on. I'm not scared of something happening, they are just
so many dark crevices in this house. I think I can hear them. Here they
come. That is so scary. Tell me about it. SCREAMING. Oh wow, that
was good. Revenge is sweet! Really good. We were exhausted from being
constantly on edge and Tardis quickly crept in. With no more or
scares, it was soon morning again. That was such an uncomfortable
night. I'm not too sure about this goes stuff. I did not see a
definite ghost, but I certainly felt weird in there. I just want to
get home because I did not get a wink of sleep.
Those manikins actually freaked me out, just that silhouette in the
dark. Marie Louise scared. Screaming at the sight of our own
shadows! And my actually getting bigger? You are. Hallowe'en is a
time when we all get scared. You guys have been sending in pictures
of what you have made. James sent us a recipe of how to make a
Hallowe'en cake. Extremely creative. Well then has centres in this card.
It is colourful on the front and it is scary on the inside. And David
is working away for us today. How is the pumping coming along? Really
good, thanks. Amazing carving. And then queue for the pumpkin pulp. I
need this because we said debt as we got sent a DVD of the Blue Peter
viewers baking. We thought it was so good that we would get her in
there to give me a helping hand. Sammi, hello. Thank you for coming
in today. You sent in a DVD. Why Today we are making pumpkin
cupcakes, perfect, spooky cake for Hallowe'en. Are you ready? Yes, I
am ready. I need your help. We have got sieved flour, baking powder,
baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg. We have got butter, eggs and some
milk and some sugar. Put that in there. That is the pumpkin pulp.
Get mixing. Mix it up. We have not got time to show you every bit
because it is TV. Then you pick the dry ingredients and put them in. We
have not got time for that. Then you have a ready made batter, which
looks like that. Sammi, I need your help. Add the mixture into there.
How much do we put in? Not all the way up to the top to let it rise in
the oven. How long is it in the oven? 20 25 minutes. It is 170
degrees. If you put in a toothpick and it comes out clean, they are
ready. Once it is cut, you have something like this. Now we have to
make the icing. This is cream cheese and icing sugar and vanilla
essence. We are going to add some yellow. That is read. Yellow and
red make orange. You are right! Put some of the icing on to those.
Actually I have got some right here. That is the art of television. When
it is dry, it is easy to decorate. How has it gone so far? I think it
has gone really well. And you have been a saving grace. I am going to
draw a spider on mine. Can I try? Sammi, good job. This time of year
and animal you see lots of images of our bats. But do they deserve
When most people think of thats, they think of a dark and spooky
creatures of the night. They go hand in hand with horrible stop did
you know that the bat is the most diverse mammal on the planet and is
more closely related to humans? Look at their wings. Spread out the
fingers of your hand and can you see the similarity? Early pictures
reveal that which is used to worship a bat like creature. They
used to put their blood in their potions to help them fly. That is
not bad. There is only one way to find out whether they are as speedy
as I think they are. I am going to meet some.    a spooky. There are
18 species in the UK. Most are in hibernation at the moment, so I
went to Chester Zoo where they have foreign species active all the year
round. The lights were on as I entered the cave, but soon they
would be dim. When it was dark, the nocturnal bats were Cup. Look at
that. He is a cracker. These are a fruit bats. They are very
vulnerable. They only come from one island. The very small bats are not
out at the moment. They wait until it gets very dark. The noise is
quite haunting. I am all right standing here, finally enough,
watching them do their own thing and everything is well lit, so you
see what is going on. When the lights go off, that could be a
whole different kettle of fish. Then I will see whether I am scared
or not. In the wild they pollinate quite important fruit trees and
they disperse seeds. They do have a role to play, even in the
production of some of the fruit we see in our supermarkets. My job was
to feed them their breakfast. They eat 50 kilos of fruit every day.
You put them on the trees to replicate them in the wild. That is
it. The big ones will land in the tree and climb to the dish. The
little ones will land directly on it and grab a piece of fruit and
fly away. When they are at a distance, I quite like being here.
I do not know what it will be like when they come closer. I was about
to find out. What is next? You are going to be clearing up some bat
droppings. I was given an area to clean, a dark cave where they live.
Entering the darkness and getting this close was about to test my
nerves. There we go. The it absolutely stinks in here. There
must be about 30 bats in there. is close to 400, but we will keep
that to ourselves. I am not sure I like how close they are getting.
That was really scary. That was freaky, all those bats circling
around me and the droppings were disgusting. But now the lights are
beginning to dim and we have almost got full darkness. When it is
completely dark, things are going to get very spooky in here. I feel
as if I am completely in their world. After my experience in the
small cave, I find walking around in the open exciting. They are
brilliant. This is one of the coolest things ever. Look at the
wingspan on that. It is like three feet. I have got these bananas and
thought I would be scared, but this is just so fascinating and
inspiring. It is brilliant. Literally none of them have bumped
into me. They are so aware of their environment. These are wild
creatures and I am really close to them feeding them a banana. This is
fantastic. That was just brilliant, stunning. I hope that has gone some
way to helping you understand them. I cannot believe it eight out of
your hand and they are so cute. but it was a once in a lifetime
opportunity. We have had backeds, pumpkin cakes and a haunted castle.
Thank you to Sammi And thank you for David to has been carving the
pumpkin for us. It is finished. That is so intricate. Well done,
David. If you want to see the giant pumpkin, head over to Windsor Great
Park and it will be there until the 2nd November. Blue Peter badge
holders will get in free. Do not miss next week when we have two
