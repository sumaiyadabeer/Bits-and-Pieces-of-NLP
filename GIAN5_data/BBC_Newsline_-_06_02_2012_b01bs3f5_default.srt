Welcome to BBC Newsline with Donna Traynor and Noel Thompson. Our main
story this evening: The former First Minister and DUP leader Lord
Bannside has been admitted to hospital.
I am at the Ulster Hospital with the latest on his condition. Also
on the programme this evening: Public spending watchdog the Audit
Office is to investigate the recruitment of hundreds of ex RUC
officers to the police. Ireland see red in Dublin. The
blame game continues after another defeat to Wales.
Not much change to come in the weather over the next 24 hours but
it will stay that way for the rest of the week. Find out shortly.
The former First Minister and DUP leader, Ian Paisley, Lord Bannside,
has been admitted to the Ulster Hospital on the outskirts of East
Belfast. His wife, Baroness Paisley, says it is a difficult time for the
family. This was Ian Paisley at just 10
place where he preached his first sermon over 60 years ago. In his 86
here, he could still attract a crowd like few others. I have had
the privilege of being a picture here for 65 years. That is a long
time. Go we declare our intention that we
will organise massive demonstrations. The this was the
young firebrand in the late 1960s, the man who would throw snowballs
at the first Taoiseach to come north and he would, for around for
decades, at be known as the doctor know of Northern Ireland politics.
We say never, never, never, never! This defiant line was aimed at the
Anglo Irish Agreement in the mid  1980s when Good Friday Agreement
replaced it he again led the campaign against it. As the DUP
became that the majority party and the IRA disarmed, he signed up to
Stormont's First Minister, forging an unlikely friendship with Martin
Lord Bannside. At the weekend, he became ill and today his wife
confirmed he was being treated in the Ulster Hospital. She asked that
family privacy be respected at what she called this difficult time. No
details were given of his illness or his condition. Last November, we
caught up with Ian Paisley as he made a rare public appearance in
Carrickfergus. He said he had no intention of retiring completely
just yet. You will see me in the pulpit and I hope that people will
not forget me, I don't think they will. I think I'll have more time
to do visitations and go to places I would have liked to have gone
when end of us. His portrait hangs in Stormont where tonight, as
elsewhere, they are awaiting updates on his condition.
Our reporter Will Leitch is at the Ulster Hospital in Belfast where
Lord Bannside is being treated. The family have asked for privacy but
what do you know? Tonight, Lord Bannside is being cared for here at
the Ulster Hospital. We understand in the intensive care unit. He was
brought here last night and reports of a heart attack are unconfirmed
at this stage. The family have asked for privacy and therefore,
we're unable to bring any particular check of how he is very
at this moment. The family has asked for things to be kept quiet
at this time. There has to be no sign of the family going to the
hospital the sacrament. Ian Paisley is 85 and six years ago, he
withdrew from public life for a short while and later said that he
had been ill and spoke in his own words of having walked in death's
shadow. Tonight, he is ill once more and being cared for here.
Mark, what is being said at Stormont? The one talking point
here has been at the help of Lord Bannside. It was mentioned at the
DUP's Group meeting this morning and members were asked to pray for
their former leader. Now as the reports went out and became public
in the afternoon, members of other parties were asking after him and
during the last five or six years, when Ian Paisley switched, other
party members have been asking for his health. He did have that patch
of ill health during the magician's but he pulled around from that last
year it was confirmed he had been fitted with pacemaker. Everybody
here is hoping for the best. The government spending watchdog is
to investigate the recruitment of former RUC officers to the police
as civilian staff on temporary contracts. The move by the Audit
Office follows BBC Newsline's revelations that hundreds of
retired officers who left with generous Patten redundancy packages
have been re employed. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Vincent
Kearney broke the story. We now have an investigation? It is the
job of the orders of us to ensure government departments and agencies
spend their money properly. I understand the Office has today
send letters to the PSNI, the Policing Board and the Department
of Justice, informing them it intends to carry out a value for 
money review. I believe the terms of reference for that if you are
still being finalised and the intention is to launch the
investigation as soon as possible. I understand the investigation will
focus on the PSNI's use of temporary and agency staff. They
have been recruited to jobs that were not publicly advertised. It
was through an agency and the vast majority of them are former police
officers who left with redundancy packages. The final terms of
reference have still to be finalised but this will be a very
in depth investigation? Indeed because we know in recent weeks,
Policing Board members have written number of points. They have
questioned the openness and transparency of this recruit and
process, they have said it has been more expensive than an open
recruitment process. That is because the agency receives a fee
for all those who are recruited. This was supposed to be a short 
term fix to fill gaps left by the retirement of large numbers of
experienced police officers in a very short period of time but here
we are, 10 years later, and the policy is still in place. Last week,
two former retired officers, they both spoke to the BBC and said they
also have concerns so I think the Audit Office will look at all of
these issues and that it whether or not this policy it was operated
fairly, did it offer value for money and was at effective? Given
the public reaction to revelations and all has gone on in recent weeks,
was this investigation 11? There was a sense that it was because we
had Sinn Fein and the SDLP who have asked the Office to investigate
this issue. The DUP members of the Policing Board then said they would
welcome an investigation and the PSNI itself was then put in a
position where they said they would also welcome independent scrutiny
so certainly there was an expectation that an investigation
would be launched. Still to come on programme: A
controversial penalty gives Wales victory over Ireland in a last
minute thrilling victory in the Six Nations.
There was a big sign on a motorway today, pointing the way to the
Titanic commemorations. A 50 year old woman has appeared in
court in Londonderry, charged with attempting to murder her 20 year 
old son. The charges in connection with the domestic incident at the
weekend. In court was Teresa Dougherty from
Derry. She is accused of attempting to murder her son in a domestic
incident on Saturday night. Her son is on a life support machine at the
Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and is being treated for serious
head injury. As the attempted murder charge was read out, she
shook her head and wept. She nodded to show that she understood the
charge. The investigating police officer told the judge he was
opposing bail because he believed the defendant's long standing
alcohol addiction could result in her committing further offences.
The defence solicitor told the court that the to live on their own.
Both had developed difficulties with alcohol and this was the issue
in the case. He added it was hoped Mr O'Connor would make a good
recovery and it was not clear yet if the attempted murder charge
would remain in place. The solicitor said she was prepared to
get help from her GP. The prosecution had no issue that the
bail application. She was released on her on bail of �500 with a
charity also of �500. She was ordered to reside at her father's
house, not to consume more possess alcohol, not to enter licensed
premises and to submit to police protests and not to have any direct
or indirect contact with her son will stop the case was adjourned
for an update next month. At 21 year old man is being held by
the police following the murder of a man in the Lurgan at the weekend.
The body was found yesterday morning.
The victim is believed to have been in his early forties and his body
was found early on Sunday morning end a flat in the Mourne the area
of the town. Forensic officers have been carrying out searches of the
flat and surrounding area. The local community is shocked at what
has happened. It is surprising because this has always been a
quiet area and a very settled community. Obviously people come
and go because they are Executive houses but on the whole it has been
quiet and it seems so out of the ordinary that this has happened.
There was also troubled just a few miles away. On Sunday morning, a
police officer was stabbed by responding to an emergency call in
the Kilwilkee estate. Police were also attacked by youths throwing
petrol bombs. This has been a tragic weekend for Lurgan and at
this time our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the victim.
We are working in Lurgan to try and moving so on. It is a different era,
this is a setback but I know that all communities will come together
and continued to work to drive Lurgan forward. Police have
arrested a 21 year old man in connection with the murder and he
is still being held for questioning. The trial of two men charged with
murdering Constable Stephen Carroll has heard that very high levels of
gunshot particles were found on a jacket which the prosecution claims
belongs to Brendan McConnell, one of the ages. A forensic scientist
told the court it was likely the jacket was in close contact with
the gun when it was fired at the police officer who was shot dead in
Craigavon in 2009. Politicians at Stormont have been
paying tribute to the Queen on the 60th anniversary of the day she
came to the throne. Over the years, she has been a frequent visitor to
Northern Ireland, welcomed by some more than others and she is due to
come here again as part of a celebrations. The Queen made her
first visit to Northern Ireland 59 years ago. Since then she has
returned many, many times. To mark her Diamond Jubilee, she is due to
visit here once again. 60 glorious years and we are really looking
forward to all the street parties and celebrations but we have
planned. I think she is marvellous. She is completely down to earth,
isn't she? Who doesn't like her? She is liked all over the world.
While many may look forward to her next engagement in Northern Ireland,
it is her trek across the border that continues to make the biggest
impact. Last year she became the first British monarch to visit the
Republic of Ireland since it gained independence in 1921 will stop it
is like a door that has been locked for a long time and she has been
dying to see what is on the other side of it because many people will

it was off limits. She always wanted to go in an official
capacity so it was issued turning  point for her. Details of exactly

It was heartbreaking, wasn't it? Ireland lost by a couple of points.
I do not think anyone would dispute that the best team won, but it is
the way that the Irish last which is causing all the controversy. The
English referee is in the headlines for two decisions which cost
Ireland the match, one of which was in the final minute of the game
when he awarded a penalty to Wales, judging that Ulstermen Stephen
No, I am sorry, I do not see that as being remotely dangerous.
crucially, though, the referee did. With less than one minute of the
game remaining and Ireland ahead by one white, Stephen Ferris was sent
to the sin bin.    1 point. Wales took full advantage. We came very
close, and I think Stephen was very harshly treated. Anyone that knows
him, he tackles very hard but very fair, and I think that this was a
prime example of the way he hits, nothing illegal about it. The home
fans also thought that the English official made the wrong course.
reaction in the stands said it all. We all of the same view, we thought
it was a bad decision. But did not appear as if he had thrown him down.
Very disappointing, they should have won, it was never a penalty
and a yellow card. Even the Welsh coach felt his players should have
received a red card rather than There were a few glimpses of
Ireland at their very best. For long periods, Wales dominated
possession and territory, but Rory Best's try gave the home side an
unlikely lead at half time. With Tommy Bowe finishing well, he
scored his 100 points in a green Jersey, and it looked like Ireland
would start the campaign with a victory. Wales had other plans,
though, and scoring    outscoring their opponents by three tries to
two, snatching a late win. Just like at the World Cup, it is the
Welsh players and their fans who are celebrating, and things do not
get any easier for these men. They face a trip to Paris to take on
The Sunderland footballer James Maclean's switch of allegiance from
Northern Ireland to the republic is likely to be completed this week.
He is expected to be named in Giovanni Trapattoni's squad for the
friendly against the Czech Republic. Locally, Linfield maintained their
four point lead at the top of the Carling Premiership at the weekend,
thrashing League Cup winners Crusaders. Goals by Albert Watson
and Phillip Lowry in the first half and Darryl Fordyce in the second
half helped them to an emphatic 5 0 victory. Portadown stayed in title
contention with a 2 0 win aganst Lisburn Distillery. Gary Breen was
on target for Ronnie McFall's team. Cliftonville are in third, two
points further back. Joe Gormely fired in a late winner against
Ballymena United at the Showgrounds. Top performance of the day may just
have been that of Brian McCaul. He scored a fantastic hat trick to
earn Glenavon a 3 2 win against But not very impressive were the
floodlghts at Dungannon. They failed for the second time in week,
which meant there wasn't a ball kicked. Coleraine fans will be let
I am sure they were not too happy! Belfast boxer Paddy Barnes has
taken another important step towards qualification for the
London Olympics, the bronze medallist at the last Games in
Beijing retained the Irish senior title in Dublin, and he was not the
only Ulsterman celebrating. Focused on making it to London,
Paddy Barnes proudly showed off his championship belts today after
winning a record breaking sixth Irish title in a row. Stage one
complete, he must now go to Turkey to the European Championships to
cement his Olympic place this summer, along with fellow Belfast
It is madness. If you are Anna leg gold medallists    a Olympic gold

Olympic Games. It does not matter, you can perform on the day. I put a
lot of pressure on myself, because I had not won the title yet, and I
really want to go to the Olympics, and this was make or break for my
Olympic dream. One boxer who was already qualified his Michael
Conlan. But he fancies some company. It would be a big boost to have the
lance, Tommy and Paddy, with me. We are all good mates. I go to
training camps with them, so hopefully they will get to qualify
and join me on the plane, you know. And hopefully bring some more a
Olympic glory back to Ireland. It was a mixed weekend for the
Gaelic football teams of Ulster in the opening round of the National
League, but one familiar face wrote back the years with a vintage
display at Croke Park. Owen Mulligan's performance helped
Tyrone beat Kildare. Thomas Niblock reports. This will be some score,
it is! Owen Mulligan, back to his very best, and when he was not
scoring, he was providing for Tyrone were trailing by three
points at half time, but an inspired second half gave Stephen
O'Neill and company are a five  point victory. It looked like Hama
would lose out to defending league champions Cork when the visitors
took a late lead, but his equaliser meant it finished level at full 
time. There was an intensity there that should not have been there,
and he would have looked probably at the court team, some of them are
very young.    Cork. The second half will do them no harm. Perhaps
the most surprising result yesterday was dairy losing at home
to Galway.    Derry. We have to put our hands up, they were the better
team on the day. Their forwards knew what they wanted to do, they
ran to the right positions, and they took their opportunities.
Finally, an Ulster Derby in Division One, and Down when the

Finally tonight, ice hockey, the Belfast Giants enjoyed a perfect
weekend at the Odyssey. Not only did they extend their lead at the
top of the Elite League to seven points, their 4 1 victory over the
Cardiff Devils ensured they reached the Challenge Cup final, winning 5

Ahead of the opening of the Titanic signature building in Belfast, a
huge if not titanic sign has been erected to mark the spot. It is
made from solid steel and his 50 metres long. Mervyn Jess traced its
journey from the firm that made it in County Tyrone.
It was hard to miss as it made its way through the Tyrone countryside
from the manufacturers near Cookstown, stopping off at the
nearby Sacred Heart Primary School en route. It is really exciting,
very exciting to see the sign outside of our school. It is
massive! We are all heading to Belfast as soon as the Titanic
Quarter opens to see it in place, and the children are privileged,
the first primary school to see the sign. They are a big part of the
Titanic Quarter. The 15 tonnes of steel set off for Belfast. There
are lots of signs along the M1, but none of them like this. It
eventually arrived at its final destination, the Titanic Quarter,
outside the newly completed signature building. It is a titanic
sign to go with a titanic building. It arrived at about the same time
as the Titanic angered at 100 years ago, and it is about the same
weight. It will be great for photo  opportunities. It is full steam
ahead to get things ready in time for the fast approaching centenary
commemorations with the nearby Nomadic having a final coat of
paint applied ever so tenderly. When this sign is eventually put in
place, it will effectively be the topping out of the building, one of
the final pieces in this jigsaw of a construction project that has
been going on now for three years. The building itself is due to open

Temperatures across parts of Britain, minus 10 degrees, very
cold. For as it is about mist and fog, pockets forming already, but
the weather itself is pretty uneventful. This was the picture
today, not very much happening, but we had some good spells of sunshine
for the eastern half of Northern Ireland at least, and a similar
picture tomorrow as well. As we go into this evening, generally dry,
perhaps a little bit of damp weather poking into parts of the
West. Thicker cloud, temperatures of about four degrees. Along the
east coast, clear skies, a slight frost developing with temperatures
down to three degrees. Some of us will get off to a chilly start, but
much the same as today, staying cloudy in western areas, another
mainly dry day with fairly light winds. From the beginning, it will
be fairly cloudy, but that cloud will give way to sunshine in
eastern areas as we go into the afternoon, and then we will have
sunshine coming out for parts of Antrim, Down and Armagh as well.
Temperatures just above the average for the time obvious well. In the
West, however, we hold on to the cloud, and it may give us a little
bit of dampness, but temperatures of about eight degrees. Into
tomorrow evening, then, clear skies in eastern areas, allowing for a
touch of frost to develop in one of two places. We hold on to the cloud
from the West, but as we go into the early part of Wednesday morning,
cloud pushing in on this weather front edging in from the Atlantic,
and that will bring a change midweek. We have that weather front
edging its way in, and the winds are going to become much stronger,
and it will become much wetter as well. This is the picture for
