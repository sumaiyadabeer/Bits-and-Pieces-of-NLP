Hello and welcome to the Sunday Politics in the South West. Coming
Taking away free bus travel from pensioners, the leader of Cornwall
Council will be here to defend his controversial proposal.
for Newton Abbot, and the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View Alison
Seabeck. Anne Marie is currently on the look out for musicians in her
constituency interested in entering the annual parliamentary music
competition Rock the House. She has been rocking the house herself this
week with a debate devoted to microbusinesses, a cause that is
close to her heart. Not a great week for businesses for
the economy with the GDP figures. They were disappointing but not
disappointing. I think that we have to focus on what we do now to
ensure that we keep this growth steadily growing. We need to ensure
that we keep regulation, which is a real problem, and we need to see
what we can do on the tax front. While the Prime Minister was
defending pairs of figures, there was a tweed from Alison pointing
out that Eton mess was being served. It is quite easy to point across
the government benches and say that regardless of the eurozone crisis
we have been making a better job of the economy. Yes, but that is not
what we should be doing. I have worked behind the scenes and of
what you have to do is ensure that you do not over promise.    and
what you have to do in his ensure that you do not over promise.
Bodies like the IMF have concerns about the level of austerity
measures which are being imposed on the British people. By the time I
scurried across the road to get the Eton mess all of the meringue were
gone. UN Tuesday, the Health Select
Committee has said that    on Tuesday, the Health Select
Committee has said that his ability to safeguard its future is being
compromised. The Lib Dem MP Andrew George is
urging the government to listen to medics and their mounting
opposition to the planned changes to the NHS. There has been hardly a
day this week when the Health and Social Care Bill has not been in
the headlines, with a critical report saying the overhaul was
getting in the way of finding savings to safeguard the future of
the service. The medical profession has been uniting in its opposition
to health care changes but there is a feeling in Cornwall that
ministers are not taking any notice. I do not have any trust in the
government about the NHS. I say that varies subtly. Unfortunately  
  I say that very sadly, because they have not been listening to the
Royal College of Nurses or any of the GPs who are leading the reforms,
and they certainly have not listened to patient. The NHS is
going through the biggest reorganisation in its history.
Under new plans, but it will be managed in local areas, a job that
used to be done by primary care trusts. There will be competition
from charity and private providers. At the same time, �20 billion in
savings have to be found by 2015. Some patients believe it that
digger will see to be played in commissioning the services.    some
patients believe that there needs to be more accountability when it
comes to commissioning these services. But it is the idea of
private sector in the NHS that were raised this doctor. The remain just
of this Bill is    the main gist of this Bill is that doctors will have
concerns that this will lead to all sorts of inequalities and we are
worried about services being fragmented and broken up and
providers coming in and cherry  picking the best services.
Ministers say they will safeguard against privatisation. They also
say that financial pressures caused by a Labour and disapproval of
pension changes are the real reasons for the backlash.
The South West has been a focus for rebellion against the plans, what
Adrian Sanders and Andrew George among cost only for her MPs against
the Bill    among cooler four MPs against the Bill. This is the
largest amount of money we have ever had to cut from the NHS and we
have to do more things and use less money but you need stability and
uncertain    certainty. You do not need to have a catastrophe going on
in the NHS at the same time what the whole world being turned upside
down. But despite backbench unease over
the Bill, this week, David Cameron continued to defend it. The error
thousands of GPs across the country    the there are thousands of GPs
across the country who are implementing these reforms. Last
year Nick Clegg claimed victory after the Government backed down on
some of the reforms. Next month, the Bill will return to the Lords,
and attention will return to the Lib Dems to see if any of them will
make renewed attempts to block the Bill.
Emery, this is turning into a I do not think I would agree that
this is a disaster. I think the real challenge to the NHS is that
it is a centre at issue and we need to make sure that we communicate
but we are doing in an appropriate way and that is one of the problems.
I think that is why we are where we are. We have an ageing population
and we have to make sure that we have an NHS for the future. A lot
of people are saying it is not doing very badly and does not need
to be turned upside down. reality is that the costs are
soaring and there have been changes as far as what is available. We
have an ageing population and if we do not address this now we will put
ourselves in a difficult position for the future. When you talk about
change, up most of the change is taking place. These new
commissioning bodies are already there and working and a budget is
being held by the PC 80s. If I can give you a personal example, I used
to chair a committee when I was a councillor, and I used to find that
having a PC tea meant that I did not get the same focus on the real
local means that I believe these counselling groups can do at a
reduced cost. Alison, Labour is the last    Labour is saying the last
thing the NHS needs his reorganisation. There is a lesson
to be learned. We were saying this in the last Parliament. A number of
people were saying that we do not need any more reorganisation and
the Prime Minister felt the same way. He pledged that there would be
no reorganisation and the first thing they did was re organise it
at a time when the economy is in a downward spiral and morale is
damaged. Morale is at rock bottom. We are seeing waiting lists going
up and we have bodies like the BMA and the Royal College of midwives,
who I was only with this week, and they are all saying this is wrong.
I suspect that when it is discussed in the house we will see very
strong opposition to it from a number of different angles. I hope
the Government does listen. Murray, Andrew George says that GPs
are were accountable and the coalition was proposing elected
board members who would be elected by the Government into primary care
trusts. I think the answer is that they are not accountable. They are
responsible to the overall commissioning Board. There is
accountability and responsibility. At the end of the day, what are we
trying to deliver? A good service that we can afford. We have got
4,000 new GPs' and the waiting list time has come down. There has been
some significant benefit. It has only been a few years since
the over 60s bus pass was added to a list of life's certainties. But
now there its an idea that there could be a charge of 50p per ride.
Cornwall cows will's idea to charge pensioners 50 p per ride has were
fired some.    Cornwall Council. This is bad. It has to be stopped
now. It will be back across the country if they get away with it.
The free bus pass was brought in by Labour, and from the start,
councillors from across the region have complained about its funding.
Government initially said they would be funding this scheme. They
have introduced a scheme that does not work and his leading places
like Exeter very short. Now, in Devon and Dorset, councillors are
having to cut around �1 million from their annual budgets.
Transport campaigners have said that that is because funding has
been cut by nearly one third. Government cuts the funding and the
it has been squeezed, the budget, and some ministers are saying they
have had to put their hands into other parts of money which should
be used to help fix roots and other parts of the transport service.
Cornwall Council says it will have to start cutting bus services in
two years' time unless it is a large    allowed to charge
pensioners 50p per ride. Some pensioners think it is a sensible
idea. I would rather pay full fare and have a bus then lose a bus.
Such tinkering with the over 60s scheme would need a change in the
law, and that does not look likely. In East Yorkshire, a voluntary
charge was tried out, but it did not work out. Ministers say that
some councils are planning to deal with the cuts using a little bit at
imagination, but it seems the, all idea is not quite what they are
looking for. I understand the idea. It is not an unreasonable idea. We
think we could put people off travelling by bus if we use this
idea. The Government has just put �90 million into a national
community transport fund and says that pensioners like Thomas need to
be confident that the free bus pass they get today will be the same as
they get next year. But others worry about how useful that pass
will be if writs are shut down to pay for it.    if it runs are shut
down. We cannot speak to the reader of
Cornwell Council. One man said    we can now speak to the leader of
Cornwall Council. One man said this was mad and bad. This was a
suggestion that came from the very pensioners who were using these
buses. How representative is this group? The big question in people's
minds, knowing that the government funding is coming down to support
this scheme, is that bus routes are threatened. People do not want to
lose theirs. What is the point of a free bus pass it there is no bus to
use it on? We are hearing this from all over the country, that people
would rather pay a small amount they have no bass. What do you make
of your own government's answer to this? We have to use all of the
imagination and solve this in different ways. We are suggesting a
pilot scheme at the moment. It does not look as though it will happen,
does it? We will be pushing for it. There is a strong argument to keep
pushing for it because Cornwall is in a stronger position than most
local authorities. We sat a four your budget strategy and we have
put money into reserves. We will be using reserves to support our bus
services in the short term for the next two years. That is exactly
what we are going to do. Government is not very welcoming of
this proposal. Emery, you have got local government experience. There
is no doubt that you sympathise. Is the government right to say that
they should use their imagination? I think they should go away and
think about it. The honest answer is that we are in different times
and have a significant that that we have to deal with and we have to be
creative. There has been a lot of cross working in Devon between the
local authority and local charities and local people. I think there are
creative ways. The Isle of Wight has come up with a very creative
way. This is creative. Yes, it is creative, and I empathise with what
people are saying. But I just feel that you could not differentiate
between those in need and those not in need. If I was going to do
something on a voluntary basis, I would create a charity. There could
be a bus pot. I know it has been tried in other areas. There had
been a areas that have tried it and have not been allowed to continue.
This will have to be addressed in a number of ways. We will be able to
buy some time in Cornwall to be creative. We need to roll out
community schemes. Other authorities will not be able to do
that. They do not have at the level of reserves and they have not
budgeted the way that we have. I see bus services Britain all over
the country, particularly in areas that will affect the coalition
government, and I think the Government will have to look at all
of the options. The primary legislation at the moment is too
restrictive. Another localism agenda, we should be allowing local
people to find their own solutions. Before the recession, Labour
brought in an agenda at that authorities said, the Government
has given us the responsibility but not the money. If it was an
affordable then it will be an affordable now. Local authorities
and pensioners are Between a Rock and a hard place on this one. They
have had their tax benefits cast    cut. It will hit some areas hardest.
Pensioners and charities like a UK are deeply worried. I understand
why you were thinking about this. But this will hit the most of
marble and poorest the hardest. I would be surprised if the treasurer
changed his mind. We will have to look for exemptions where we can.
Now for a round up of the political week in 60 seconds.
And the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges is holding a summit. We
have It's been a thoroughly energised Week as the South West
was declared Britain's first Marine Energy Park.
Anti nuclear campaigners have been getting their teeth into plans to
expand Hinkley Point. The sun broke through for people
Now the Appeal Court says the Energy Minister will have to think
again. Or will he? We were disappointed with this result,
clearly. The Secretary of State is now clear that we will take this to
the Supreme Court. The economic prospect was decidedly
cloudy as the Centre for Cities declared Plymouth one of the worst
places in the country for losing private sector jobs.
In Exeter, though, one of the city's oldest trades,
ecclesiastical tailoring, proved it's still as vibrant as ever.
have been having a clerical fashion crisis!
But about the way this has been handled, Anne Marie? I believe that
this is a great scheme but the way it was handled in terms of the
termination at such short did us, I agree with you... It should have
been foreseen. It could have been done the from the. We need to get
help for energy because it has to be one of the most important
sources going for it to solve our problem. Labour set it up, should
they have foreseen that this would have been unaffordable? I think
governments always have a responsibility to look for word
when it comes to the cost of a programme. It is an incredibly
valuable programme. There have been small set ups and some large
proposals. I am surprised that the Government is going to spend even
more tax payer money on taking this right to the bitter end, to the
wire. I think it makes more sense now to say, let's go with it,
