Yeah, it may look awful, but this might be the future of video on the

issue of net neutrality   who owns the internet, and will we have to
pay more for a decent service in the future? Plus, a vastly
widespread problem, but are the web pirates foojly about to hit the
rocks? And after Apple blew its tablet
trumpet recently you now get to have your say on the Ipad. All that

London's Covent Garden. I am Spencer Kelly. When we connect to
the internet, we take it as read that no preference will be given by
your internet provider for access to one website over any other. It
wasn't, for example, allow you to download a movie or symphony from
ITunes any faster than it would from Amazon, say. It's an idea
called net neutrality. It's an unwritten principle that has been
at the heart of the internet since its birth more than 40 years ago,
but right now in the USA there is serious discussion whether all of
that is under threat. The internet in 2010, overflowing
with rich media enjoyed by millions of Americans with access to
broadband, but as the networks delivering that data feel the
strain, they're demanding a fundament change to the rules
governing the internet. Instead of treating all information equally,
they want to manage their own pipes the way they see fit, perhaps
charging websites in return for prioritising their traffic or
throttling back sites which pay less. And it's a debate which has
the gaze of the highest office in the land. President Obama is keen
to ensure the ISPs don't get their way. We've got to keep the internet
open. We don't want to create a bunch of gateways that prevent
somebody who doesn't have a lot of money but has a good idea from
being able to start their next YouTube or Google. The FCC or
Federal Communications Commission has been listening to both sides in
the debate. Google, Amazon, eBay, Skype and others who support net
neutrality form the open internet coalition. They say smaller
companies should be given equal access to the internet pipes, and
of course these big players also don't want the ISPs to control
users' access to their sites. is for us the best example of what
it means to consumers. In 2003 when the founders of Skype invented the
software, they did it in a basement bar in London. And they were able
to address a global market of users threw an open internet. They put
the software up. It was distributed throughout the planet, and within
months, millions of users were making free calls. The argument is
small businesses would never be able to compete with companies that
have multi million dollar cash reserves, and therefore would find
it difficult to reach consumers. On the other side are the internet
service providers, or ISPs, like comcast, Time Warner andEr haveison
who oppose new laws. All we want to do have the chance to compete, so
what we can do in the marketplace and what we can offer is the issue.
I think as long as we can do that and it's a competitive market, it's
good for the consumer. It's already resulted in investment and
innovations for these networks. ISPs have seen network traffic
increase dramatically in recent years. They also feel entitled to
share in the billions of dollars generated by Google and others,
taking it directly from the consumer is a problem, because
Americans are used to unlimited service for one monthly fee.
In the past couple of years, there have been various experiments tried
out on the American public. One internet service provider, for
example, tried tiered pricing, which it quickly found was
unpopular with web users. Tiered pricing trials failed because of
small caps which detered the use of high band width applications. Net
neutrality supporters don't mind consumers deciding to pay higher
prices for, let's say, faster gaming device, but when it comes to
ISPs demanding higher tariffs to have their service delivered faster,
that's where they see problem. always been the broadcaster, the
cablecaster, the satellite provider that's told the consumer what they
can watch and when they can watch it. The internet changes all of
that what we don't want is a system where the internet turns into a
cable system or into the broadcast system. So we want the control to
remain with the consumer, so net neutrality is very much a consumer
issue. Conservative commentators agree it's a consumer issue but
take a different view. Traffic, of course, is growing on the internet
at an exponential rate. We need to keep expanding, upgrading our
network, but if net neutrality leads the internet service
providers to go slow on future investment, that's not a good thing
for consumers. Ultimately, this is an intensely political battle being
fought out in the corridors of power in Washington, DC. That might
be so, but it's clear that every American internet user has a vested
interest in its outcome. The fairly neutral Ian Hardy there.
As well as uploading large pictures to your online photo book and
streaming video and the occasional bit of music, there may be another
reason why some of our internet lines may be throbbing with traffic.
If you indulge in the occasional bit of file sharing, stay with us.
We'll have the latest from the file sharing front line soon. First,
a look at the latest tech news. Google's used to creating a buzz
but this time it's made official. Google Buzz brings together Gmail
media sharing and social status updates under one umbrella. It's an
attempt to take on Facebook and Twitter, but is it any good? We'll
have a full row view later in the show.
Kenya is investigating whether ISPs are colluding to keep broadband
prices high. Allegations of price  fixing have been circulating since
two new undersea cables linking East Africa to the internet
backbone promised faster speeds and cheaper connections. The Ministry
of Information said it was concerned of reports that they're
physically cutting each other's data cables in an attempt to
sabotage the competition. Apple has been criticised for refusing to
accept a new mobile application for its Ap Store, all because its
description was referred to a competitor. Flash of Genius had
highlighted it was a fine list in Google's Android developers'
challenge, which the bosses couldn't quite bring themselves to
publish. Not wishing to miss out on such a huge market, the company has
since complied and removed the offending reference, all of this at
a time when Apple is asking developers how it might improve the
Application process. OK. We've all had a little bit of
time now to cool down after the hype and palaver that surrounded
the launch of Apple's Ipad at the end of last month. Steve Jobs told
us all how wonderful with and magical the device will be.
Personally I hope it earns him enough money to finally be able to
afford a belt. It received a tonne of coverage in the press the next
day, but lots of you bombarded us with your comments too.
Surprisingly, not that many of them were pro Ipad. Many of you were
sceptical about how successful the device will be. Is Apple's magic
There were, of course, those who And finally, a mocked up picture
sent to us by Jeff Messton amongst many others which I think sums up
many people's reaction on seeing the iPad for the first time. Hello!
I'm on the iPad. No! It's rubbish! Loving your comments. Keep them
Back in the olden days, the music industry was horrified to discover
that people were sharing music tracks illegally using the internet.
Despite ten years of legal wranglings, lawsuits and copy
protection, well, they're still doing it. In fact, with today's
high speed broadband connections it's possible to share entire
movies, software and video games. We report on the continuing arms
race between the file sharers and the authorities still determined to
stop them. 1.5 million Australian dollars  
that's how much the pixilated plumber Mario has cost an
Antipodean file sharer this week. Settling out of court, the file
sharer had been tracked down by the copy holders Nintendo who
identified him as the first person to upload the game for the Wii to
file sharing sites. This case highlights efforts by the creative
industries to protect their revenue streams, efforts which have
increasingly seen attempts at governance to the copy Wright
holder's calls. The music and movie companies have
long maintained they need the help of internet service providers to
track down and locate illegal file sharers. The recent UK Government's
proposals for Digital Britain have suggested ISPs will become
responsible for punishing illegal file sharers. While their
suggestions have met with support from the copyright holders they're
not so popular in other quarters. think the rights holders are crying
foul, but turning to the ISPs and asking them to disconnect customers
that the rights holders have identified as illegal file sharing
is not the solution to the problem. The French Government has approved
plans to punish pirates. Illegal file sharers will receive warning
e mails, then a letter from their ISP. If they persist, they can be
disconnected from the internet for up to a year. The UK Government is
proposing a similar scheme. Copyright holders will inform ISPs
of illegal activity. It's then up to the ISP to take steps against
the file sharer. The Government have said they want to punish the
seven million file sharers there are in Britain. The problem with
that is that the criminal justice system in Britain only dealt with
2.1 million cases last year. It simply can't cope with having
another seven million. If you look at the prospect of taking legal
action against seven million people, it's not a very effective way of
proceeding, so that's why we're looking more to ISPs and a system
of graduated response where ISPs will warn their users that they're
infringing copyright and ask them to stop. It's unfair. It's terribly
biased, and it employs one industry to do the dirty work of another
industry. We think that's wrong. don't see it as doing the dirty
work at all. We see it as ISPs cleaning up their networks and
helping people not to be in breach of the law, so we see it as a
positive thing for them. But some internet service providers have
pointed out it's possible to fool the technology used to track file
sharing. There are mistakes that can go on. The most obvious one is
one where a subscriber's connection has been hacked into by a neighbour
or somebody   somebody could be up to a hundred or 200 metres away and
hack into their connection. In that case, that subscriber will be
identified as the person doing the illegal file sharing where in fact
There is software available on the web that allows people to share
files without arousing suspicions. I am missing two internet radio
stations, looking for artists that I have selected in my wish list,
identifying them when they are playing and recording tracks down
to the hard drive, a technique known as ripping. Mobile phones
also provides an opportunity for the wiley web pirate on the move.
On Google Market, I can search for an    an artist, choose one of
their songs, selected for download and that will download it off one
site in the world where Google has found it. If you stop one way of
doing something that is illegal, they will find another way of doing
it. We believe it is a small percentage of users and most uses a
file service    for her sharers would prefer to use legal servers
like Spotify rather than pay for and a legal service. Most people
are not interested, they would rather just get their music easily.
So if hard core illegal for a share this can avoid detection, how can
copyright holders seek them. cannot police it unless you wish to
take a Chinese Great Fire Wall of China approached. The reality is
the internet is just an environment where you cannot police what goes
on. We see ISPs as an issue of corporate this was a witty as much
as anything else. I S P has a network.    as an issue of
corporate responsibility. They need to tell their use as they are
breaking the law and ask them to stop. A unless you are willing to
turn off the Internet, you won't stop it. And even if you do,
children will be swapping files on their memory sticks in the
playground the next day. This brings us back to the question of
whether regulating the internet can ever really succeed.
Now, not everyone is an illegal filesharer. But as we said, more

Very little let up in the cold weather across the UK this weekend.
Struggling in the Lowell    below her temperatures. Showers across
central and eastern areas and some patchy as expected. More showers in
these areas as we going to Sunday morning and any breaks in the cloud
between them will allow the temperatures to break.   
temperatures to drop. For one reason or another, a grey and
gloomy start to the second half of the weekend. Still with her risk of
sleet and snow although as the day goes on, it will become brain.
Temperatures hovering around freezing.    it will become rain.
This weather front comes into Scotland and news across frozen
ground, a similar risk in Northern Ireland as well. They could be
difficult conditions out there. For the South West of England and Wales,
thanks to a dry day to day and tonight, it is chilly on Sunday to
start with and they could be patches of fog as well but
essentially, the weather won't be too troublesome. On Sunday, bloody,
showers in central and eastern areas. Try it was the West of
England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the cloud will
thicken throughout the day. Some pretty persistent rain on the way
for Rome. A very lively weather in southern Europe at the moment.
Heavy rain as we crossed the Atlantic and head towards Canada.
Meanwhile, back home, for us, the rain comes in and it needs the cold
air that has been sitting across the UK and the Blue starts to turn
to Wight. The worst of this weather may occur here. In the early part
of the week, there will be a significant amount of snow. At the
