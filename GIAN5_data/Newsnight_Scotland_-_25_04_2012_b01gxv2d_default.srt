Tonight on Newsnight Scotland, Donald Trump makes his progress
into the Scottish Parliament. He has made his arguments against win
power and the government. Might he actually have a point? Was a
tonight, automated electronic counting. Having got it right this
time? Good evening. The Donald Trump circus arrived at Holyrood
today. It was described as the most in but exciting thing ever seen at

believe in tide technology and I think you have great opportunities
for other things and other forms of energy. But wind turbines, made in
China, are going to be the destruction, and almost a total
destruction, of the tourism industry. The committee room could
not take everyone, so some reporters and photographers at be
accommodated elsewhere. If I spoke to people in your community, they
did not be happy. He has been given his evidence based on this document
out. Will he be calling the first minister mad Alex? I spend this
money, and now I might regret it. After I invested tremendous amount
of money in this, and completed it, then this starts to come. I think
it has a terrible way to treat a person investing tens of millions
of pounds in Scotland. When I first got involved, there were 10 miles
away, then they were three miles away, now they are one mile away.
One mile is not even a sea wind. It is really on the coast. The concept
of a wind turbine wind one buy out Time for another classic trump

Britain weeks, the first minister has been described as a Mad Alex.
didn't say that, you did. Now there are stories going round calling in
Scotland's Hitler. You're like him? Yes. I think he is misguided. If
you spent this sort of money on wind farms, I think Scotland will
have no money, they will be in a disastrous state. They will be
unable in five years to replace these horrendous things that they
have built, when the UK stops subsidising, Scotland will go broke.
One anti  Trump documentary maker said it was the golf course that
was the real problem. It is one of the worst environmental crimes in
history. He has got a failed documentary. Let Mr Trump answer
the question. He said he was the evidence, such was his expertise in
tourism, and he would not build the hotel part of his golf complex if
it had to look into the face of wind turbines? Then it was time to
go. The circus should never stay What was it like in the line of the
Donald Trump storm? There was sorting    there was a lot of heat
and colour at the committee meeting today, I wasn't sure that there was
a lot of light, and we didn't learn more than we already knew on wind
power and renewable energy, but I think what this has done is created
a level of public interest in the work of the parliamentary committee
on renewable energy. I think that is a positive thing. Outside,
protesters both against her bines and dump    Trump made their point
known. This man is becoming some    something of a local hero. But pro
wind farm... I don't think there was much interest in what Mr Trump
was saying. He is clearly a sceptic of climate change. It is baffling
as to why he was at the Scottish Parliament at all. Then it was time
to say farewell. Both have a puppet and to the one who likes to pull
the strings. I am joined now by Mark Gibson, who was giving
evidence, and by the green MSP Patrick Harvey. I note that you
have some sympathy with his arguments, but he is the master of
overstatement, isn't he? probably is, but what he has done
is to bring the whole subject and debate to a fork, and I think it is
a good thing. Patrick Harvey, particularly on Donald Trump, you
could argue that this is a glorified case of not in my
backyard. These turbines are parked right next to his golf course.
Singh has this got his government was so keen to promote the
development, why can't they just shift the turbines? They already
have been discussions about adapting and changing the proposals
of offshore wind deployment South     centres, and the response has
been measured, as they usually are, describing the odd change here and
there. The developer responsible for listening to beckon for   
concerns. Mr Trump has a very different attitude to development.
When you do not get your way, you pick up the bone to the first
minister and say give me what I want or a walk away. He does not
seem to understand the democratic planning process, and I'm sorry to
see    say that Alex Salmond did not understand either. But he is
making a fuss. He committed gigantic bust. If you build a big
new house somewhere, and the suddenly found that there was going
to be a wind farm right next to it, or a gas plant or something like
that, that you had led to believe worst further away, you be
understandably annoyed about it? I don't buy the idea that Mr Trump
has been given such assurances, but the development will be about the
size of a thumbnail held at arm's length. This really is not an issue.
What we need to a cat is the quality of the evidence that we
heard today. Equality was about rock bottom. We had to sit through
a stream of trouble, riddled with inaccuracies, and the man seems
obsessed with Chinese turn up    turbines when there are none in
Scotland. He was obsessed with other forms of electricity. He is
making an issue out of alleged promises, which apparently don't
I know you want to give us your views on to her Bines, on Donald
Trump in particular, it seems peculiar that the Scottish
government is very keen on Donald Trump and wind turbines, it can be
a coincidence that both things are in such close proximity, can it?
You have to assess every side on its merits. I do not agree with
Patrick Harvie that the evidence was repetitive. What it underlines
is the growing unhappiness. Hardly a week goes by without a one
authoritative paper from professional bodies or engineers
saying that this policy does not work. A I know that your
organisation marshals all the arguments it can, understandably.
Is there a groundswell of support for your position? If there is, it
presumably is mainly honest better grounds? It is on Donald Trump
grounds. As I said, I said to Patrick Harvie this morning, we all
want to be on the same size copper    on the same side, we will want
the best for Scotland. We have a policy which is not based on
evidence and which people are increasingly not believing in. That
is a very dangerous thing. People would accept something they might
not otherwise like so much if they believe that it is right. If they
see that it is wrong, their views are ignored, democracy is trampled
on. That is dangerous. What is needed is an independent review of
the whole system. In what sense is democracy trampled on? All these
wind turbines are subject to planning controls. It is a very
unlevel playing field. You have the developer spending tens of millions
of pounds on every application against local communities, the ones
who are most affected the and least able to have found    to defend
themselves. They have the least time to make an objection, they
have 28 days compared to years for the developer, if their local
authority decided and listens to their concerns, and reject the
application in over 45 out of 50 appeals, the Government pushes it
through. Patrick Harvie, if there is a case for compromise on the
Donald, is there a case for compromise more generally? I know
you're in favour of wind turbine ploo mac, but you must accept that
there are a lot of people who live in rural areas to Dong want to have
their view dominated by these things. Is there some way of
getting what you want a without imposing what a lot of people do
not want? Mr Gibson is quite right to and from    to argue for a
fairer planning system. I will support changes for that. His
position on this development, renewable energy, wind power, is
inconsistent. He said tonight that we should take a case by case
approach. The Wren submission at her calls for a moratorium. No, I
stand by a... He seems to be rejecting all mainstream climate
science. At least the community against carbines have a legitimate
stake in this. It is about time someone asked dog Trump who the
hell he thinks he is to come and dictate energy policy in Scotland.
He had ignored my point. Is there a compromise, there are a lot of
people that agree with Mark Gibson. Wider community appeal I have long
argued for in the planning system. It is something that would level
the playing field. I would still support that. Mark Gibson, briefly.

the programme, if you want! It is just after a week until the
polling stations open in Scotland's local council elections. The last

the scenes. A sophisticated electronic system

across Scotland if this trend continues. In the end it, 130,000
ballots were rejected, supposedly spoiled. Most had been rejected by
the counting machines without human intervention. 2007 was the perfect
storm. We had elections to the Scottish Parliament and local
government on the same day. We had the single transferable vote be
introduced at the same time for local government elections. We had
the ballot paper design for the Scottish Parliament, which created
all sorts of problems and we had e  counting, all of this on the same
day, all at once, and inevitably, I think, something went wrong.
big question is, is it going to be accurate? Is it going to be secured
and is it going to work? The process is under new management. An
IT consultancy and an election services company says it has been
exhaustively tested. We have scant 10,000 Cup    10,000 ballot papers.
We then took recommendations from the local authorities to enhance
the software, to improve it for the voters and for the users. We then
went through a phase of trying out the software, demonstrating the
software and that culminated a a large scale demonstration in Perth,
