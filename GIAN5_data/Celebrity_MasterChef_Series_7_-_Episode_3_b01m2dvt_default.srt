We've got 16 celebrities
battling it out to win the Masterchef crown.
This building is like a pressure zone.
These celebrities have already made a name for themselves
in their own professions.
But can they cut it in the kitchen?
I need to get better to stay in the competition   I'm aware of that.
I want to be number one, all the way.
Cooking doesn't get tougher than this.
All this week, these four celebrities have been battling
to stay in the Masterchef competition.
But at the end of today,
one of them will be going home.
With each task, I'm gaining a little more confidence.
I'm finding myself lying awake at night,
thinking about the mistakes I've made!
I just have to persuade them that I know what I'm doing.
It's not going to be easy!
There is so much pressure, and to put a plate out to the second
is one of the hardest skills I've ever had to do.
You think that you're great and then you go out there
and you kind of crumble.
I've probably got to up my game a little bit, I think.
We have two tests for you today,
and at the end of this,
one of you will be leaving us.
Your first test is a classic recipe.
We want you to attempt to make
a blackberry and frangipane tart.
Delicious if you get it right, horrendous if you mess up.
One hour and fifteen minutes. Let's cook.
Blackberry and frangipane tart is a lovely thing.
It's moist, sweet pastry.
It's got the flavour of almonds
and the sharp sweetness of blackberry. John.
Done well   delicious.
You've had 15 minutes.
Javine, when she lined her pastry cases,
didn't put any paper in  
just put the baking beans straight on top.
They've all soaked into the pastry and now you have this lump of pastry
with baking beans in it. No way to rescue that.
Why are you putting cream in it?
Cos you just said, "It's yellow   cream it."
Yes   cream, butter and sugar together   not put cream in it!
SHE GROANS Try a recipe.
How do you feel about cooking from a recipe and being constrained like this?
I've never cooked from recipes before. I normally go home, see what's in the fridge,
see what's in the cupboard, throw it all in,
and see how it tastes.
But it normally comes out good.
Right, we're out of here. Javine   good luck.
Thank you, guys. Thank you.
Anything baking,
I'm going to be pretty nervous about.
Frangipane, pastry, a filling and some cream.
It can't be that difficult, can it, Jamie?
This is so far out of my comfort zone,
it's ridiculous.
I've never made pastry before,
and I'm really struggling.
  D'you want a hug?
  Is that all right?
Come on, let's have a little hug.
Thanks, mate.
  Cheers, buddy.
  All right.
  Yeah, I'll be all right.
How would you feel today if you went home and Steve stayed in the competition?
Cos I believe you two have decided
to have a little bit of in fighting going on. Is that right?
How are you getting on?
Yeah, brilliant. Pastry's my forte.
I'm glad something is.
Jamie is having what we know in the trade
as an absolute disaster.
Play Doh is about the same texture as normal pastry.
It shouldn't stick to your hands!
I've no idea what's going to come out of Jamie's oven.
You're half way! Half way call, guys.
On the personal challenges,
I haven't done anything yet for John and Gregg they can actually eat,
so today, as a bare minimum,
I want my dish to be edible.
Do you eat desserts?
I would generally go starter main starter,
but it's like chemistry, isn't it? Let's have a go.
OK. So where are you up to in the process so far?
I've put my pastry in the fridge. Looks miles better than Theakston's,
so that's a good start.
  They're good!
  Top shelf for the big lad.
Are they on the top?
And I'm making this   I think this is the frangipane.
D'you want to stay in the competition?
After the first few challenges,
I would have given anything to go out,
so I didn't have to go through the pain of looking like a numpty.
No, I definitely want to stay in. Don't want to be the first out. That would be a shame.
I'm going to hopefully enjoy myself, and hopefully,
make a dish I'm going to get positive remarks from.
I think they're sort of
a little lacking in faith at the moment. Justifiably.
Hi, Anne. How you getting on?
Well, I've completely screwed up the pastry,
and some of the innards are coming out into the oven dish as we speak.
It might have to stay in a few minutes longer.
  Mm.
  But you never know. Miracles do happen.
Occasionally.
  You don't bake?
  Not really, no.
  D'you like desserts?
  No. I don't eat them, so I hardly ever cook them.
  Cor, couldn't have been worse, could it?
  Not really, no.
Anne has forgotten to actually bake the pastry shell at all.
So even if that tart does look good,
it's just going to fall apart. It's going to be like a sponge cake.
You've got seven minutes left.
This task has frightened all four of them.
None of them is a particularly accomplished pastry chef   that's for sure.
Last 30 seconds.
30 seconds to go.
That's it. Stop now, stop!
Time's up.
We asked you all to make a blackberry and frangipane tart,
with a blackberry sauce and a blackberry cream.
We should have a lovely, crisp pastry shell  
little whole blackberries sticking through it.
A whipped, shiny cream which is flavoured with the alcohol,
and a syrupy sauce.
Simple.
  Shall we start with you, Jamie?
  Sure.
I'd like it a little firmer in the middle, but the flavours are all there.
I mean, this is just pure luck, mate.
That went in the oven with your fingers and toes,
and everything else you could cross, crossed.
I mean, I just expected this to come up in a bucket.
I am flabbergasted.
You got crispy pastry around the top,
you have a lovely bit of frangipane which is all wonderful and sweet.
Your cream is well made, and thick with the flavour of the blackberries.
You can see why you put those blackberries in the middle  
to mask the fact that the centre was not cooked.
There's not even a base in the middle!
Where's the base gone from the middle?
It's not absolutely right, but you've given it a good go.
I knew I had to get something out,
so what that was to become, I really had no idea.
So that was a bit of a miracle!
Anne, your turn.
Just for Gregg and I, I'm going to take away the metal.
That's a good idea, yes.
But I didn't have to do it.
Although you made mistakes,
it's not bad at all.
The frangipane is cooked well.
The bottom is still raw, which is a bit of a shame.
The cream is well flavoured, but it's all melted across your hot tart.
It's not bad, Anne.
Not bad at all.
The gods were smiling, then.
Should have been horrible.
The flavours are great,
but it's no longer a blackberry and frangipane tart  
it's almost like a Victoria sponge.
It's all gooey in there and jam like,
which I think tastes great, but it wasn't what you set out to do.
I've kind of gone from absolutely appalling to mediocre, I feel.
It could have been a lot worse than it was.
Steve,
now for yours.
It's a shame you've covered it with the cream,
because it actually looks like the frangipane is perfectly set.
I can't see, until I go in.
Round the edge,
you've got perfectly set frangipane,
flavoured with almonds.
You've got really nice, crisp pastry,
And you've got a lovely flavour of sweet, sharp blackberries.
That cream as well gives it heat and it's great. You get into the middle
and you completely lose the texture.
It goes to slush.
I'll tell you what, mate.
Another few minutes in the oven and we're looking at a perfect tart.
Bar the centre of your tart, which is not cooked enough,
the rest of the textures and flavours are absolutely spot on.
It's really good stuff, Steve!
Look, we've been searching for the cook
and with a recipe, it looks like we might have found one.
I'm very proud of what I did today, y'know.
If there hadn't been a recipe, I'd have been absolutely finished,
but I've got a little bit of love for that. I've learnt a lot.
I'll definitely try more desserts. The wife's going to love me.
Javine.
  Shall we try yours?
  If you really want to.
You know what's wrong here, don't you?
  Yeah, big time.
We know the pastry's undercooked, you can see that.
The tart is upside down,
the majority of your filling of the tart, the frangipane,
seems to be on the floor of your oven.
Oh, I don't know, do I taste it? I'm going to have to.
It's wrong, all wrong.
You've got to read the recipe.
Every single line of that recipe.
Cream's lovely.
Raw blackberries on top, great. Sauce is delicious, the tart itself...
Disaster. I'm sorry.
It's a gooey, horrible mess.
  I think you're better than this.
  Absolutely gutted.
Really gutted.
It didn't go well for me at all in there.
It just looked like a dog's dinner on the plate there!
And I'm really upset, really upset.
Right, OK, well done.
We'll see you again soon. Off you go.
I tried to get the bottom of the flan out from underneath and it collapsed.
Do you know what? Steve had the strongest round.
I think you're right.
I'm really pleased he followed the recipe
and delivered something good.
Why he threw all that cream over the top, I've no idea.
As for Anne, I just think it's still the same thing,
it's about detail.
It's a sloppy approach, John. You could shake her.
Why would you leave the base underneath the tart?
Doesn't make any sense.
Jamie, I don't know how he actually had a tart
in any shape or form on his plate.
He must have been amazed when that came out
and sat upright on the plate.
Not as amazed as ME, watching his process.
Javine didn't put paper between her pastry and her beans
when she blind baked it, so the beans sunk into the pastry,
which meant she had to do it all over again, so she ran out of time.
Still all to play for.
The celebrities now have one last chance to prove
they've got what it takes to stay in the competition,
because one of them will be going home.
This is your chance to cook your own food,
the food that you love,
the food that YOU think will keep you in this competition.
One hour.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's cook.
Jamie's promising us the classic combination of venison
and juniper berry sauce. What a wonderful thing.
He's got red wine, celeriac and sweet potato.
But will that venison hold up
with all those other big flavours around the outside?
'I think that Greg and John are going to love it.'
  We'll see.
You all right, James? This is a combination of very strong flavours.
  Yes.
  Can you balance these successfully?
  I think so.
I think the sauce, with the rich ruby colour,
got some colour in my root vegetables
and the greens, I think it will look fantastic.
  You seem a lot calmer than you did in the last round.
  Yes, I feel fine now.
I realise I made a few mistakes in the past,
simply by getting a bit flustered early on, so I'm determined not to do that this time.
Is it harder for you
because you're further away from the bench than any other contestant?
I'm not sure about that.
Are you staying in the competition? Do you want to?
I can't tell you how much fun I've had.
It's been fantastic and I'd love to be able to stay on.
If I can stay on today, I'd be thrilled.
  If you push down your blade against the flat bit...
  Ah, yes.
And I've got a whole scallop.
Ah ha.
MY scallop, YOUR scallop.
One does get nervous and I usually cook this dish
and people enjoy it, but I could always get it wrong.
Anne, what are you going to cook for us?
Pan fried scallops with salad,
with mango and avocado and red pepper
and a chilli dressing.
  A bit of sunshine, a bit of Australia in there?
  A little bit there, yes.
Combination of flavours are absolutely beautiful, I think.
  Anne.
  Yes?
  Good luck.
'Anne's dish is beautiful, but simple.'
However, scallops, mint, chilli,
it could be stunning and it needs to be.
You are halfway. Just 30 minutes left.
'Javine has chosen a fillet of beef with celeriac and parsnip mash.'
I love the idea of it. I think it's a great dish.
  Javine, can you put the horrors of that tart behind you?
  I hope so.
  How?
  Just make sure that I do this dish perfectly for you guys.
The only problem with this dish
is I haven't actually done the celeriac and parsnip mash before.
I normally just do it with potato mash,
but I thought I'd put a twist on it at the last minute and I changed it.
I've watched lots of contestants, Javine,
  you are really up for this competition.
  Oh yes.
So excited. I've got to do my mum proud.
She's attempting for the first time ever celeriac and parsnip mash.
It's always dodgy in Masterchef
to come here and do a dish that is unpractised.
'My family's been really, really supportive.
'It's been a real joint effort.'
I can't go today, I don't want to go today.
'The more you're in the competition,
'the better you want to do.'
I think it would be such a shame if I went out at the first hurdle.
  Steve? Big day for you?
  Yes, I'm enjoying it.
At least I'm cooking something I'm comfortable with. Garlic mash.
It's a lovely fillet steak
and there's some green beans on there as well.
It's my favourite, so I thought I'd share.
  What's that sauce thing that's going on?
  This is a peppercorn sauce.
I figured you might like a sauce, so I thought I'd make the effort.
How does this compare with the pressure of an Olympics?
Do you know what? It's worse.
I'm not being funny. At an Olympics, you train for 15 years,
you know you've got a two minute chance of getting a medal.
In here, there's just different pressures.
And there's so many more people watching, let's face it.
'For Steve, his favourite dish to eat, steak, beans, garlic mash.'
But now he's also adding to it a cream sauce.
It's one he's devised for Masterchef. Risky. Risky.
Last five minutes!
30 seconds to go.
That's it, celebrities. Time is up.
Jamie has cooked a fillet of venison
with a redcurrant and juniper sauce,
served with greens and a root veg mash.
Good looking plate of food, Jamie.
The sweetness of your vegetables with the sweetness of your sauce
is quite strong, but then you get flecks of peppercorns
and bits of juniper berry, the richness of that,
very well cooked, beautifully seasoned piece of venison.
Even your green veg are lovely and iron rich,
so the whole thing comes together as one.
I like it a lot. I really like it a lot.
I think it's great.
The venison is well cooked and very well seasoned.
The mash is well seasoned, the vegetables are soft.
Good work, mate. It's good work. Looks good.
Thank you very much.
I feel absolutely exhausted.
But thrilled.
Anne has pan fried her scallops
and serve them with a mango, pepper
and avocado salad with a chilli dressing.
In the words of a great Australian,
crikey and strewth.
That's big.
I really like the component parts.
That scallop I've just had has been cooked absolutely beautifully.
Some of the others, being torn so badly, aren't.
I like the zing of your green chilli dressing, which is fiery
and rich and got lots of flavour.
The salad itself with all those bits and pieces
are becoming a bit overpowering.
Maybe a little bit too much. Take a couple of ingredients away.
Yes.
Flavours are absolutely great.
You've got to turn your head to a little bit of finesse here, Anne.
  Your dishes needs to be as elegant as you.
Aw, how sweet.
I think I could have done a lot better
had I not had the curve of having to get the scallops out of the shell.
Steve's dish is peppered steak with garlic mash,
green beans and a peppercorn and shallot sauce.
Your piece of meat is well rested,
it's well seasoned,
your mashed potato is beautiful, buttery and smooth
and just a hint of garlic. I love it, love it, love it.
I have to say, honestly, I would eat the whole thing.
That's what I wanted. As long as you'd eat it.
Your piece of beef, fiery with that pepper on the outside,
for me, is cooked absolutely perfectly.
The sauce is powerful. Really powerful and really rich.
And it's actually a shame it's not a little bit thinner
to bring the whole dish together as one.
Yes, I'm actually impressed.
I said from the start, I want to do a dish
that those guys would want to eat.
And I put something there that both of them said they'd like to finish
so for me, that's a massive victory.
Javine hopes to impress the judges with her fillet of steak,
served with parsnip and celeriac mash, caramelised shallots
spinach and a red wine jus.
I really appreciate the work that's gone into this presentation.
  I think it's really pretty.
  Thanks.
  It's the best looking dish here.
That's good.
That's really, really good.
It is sweet and it is fruity and it's earthy and it's woody
because of the puree. I love your jus,
love the seasoning, but that spinach is a problem.
  Not all the leaves are cooked and it's leaking water.
  Yes.
I didn't expect that at all.
There's a really lovely savoury note coming from your red wine sauce
with the deepness of those sweet shallots
Your beef is melt in the mouth, because it is so rare.
But for me, the prize is that celeriac and parsnip puree.
It's good cooking.
I really enjoyed it.
I did really feel like I was really cooking up there.
Thanks for your efforts.
Now we are going to make the decision of who stays
and which one of you is going home.
Thanks very much.
'An exciting three days actually with our four celebs
'and I think they've come up trumps.'
All four of them have showed real staying power.
The best contestant from these celebrities
throughout the competition has been Javine.
But, her tart was an absolute disaster.
I've got to say, at least she came back with a real fight.
The beef dish, the flavours were really good
and her eye for detail throughout this competition has been great.
I really don't want to go.
I don't want to be the first one out today.
No one was more surprised a tart shape came out of that oven than Jamie.
  It was nothing short of a miracle.
  But, his venison dish was great.
Really great.
The idea of it all ending now is, is too much to bear.
In the classic recipe test, Anne's pastry wasn't cooked enough,
still sitting on the metal base, the cream splashed across the top.
That scallop dish was absolutely delicious.
I loved the taste of her salad.
However, her dish was far too big and unwieldy.
  John, it was bordering ugly.
  Again, finesse.
I believe I can improve on everything
I have done in this competition.
I don't know whether I'll get the opportunity to do it after today.
Steve has complicated the whole of the judging process.
He had a disastrous start,
but today, he produced the best tart, actually.
Steve's steak was nice, really well seasoned
and that mashed potato to me was a revelation.
I am having such a fantastic time,
so I'd love to stick around, but it's going to be a big ask.
Who's leaving, John? Who's leaving?
We do really, honestly appreciate
the amount of work and effort you've put into this.
The person leaving us is...
Anne.
Thanks, Anne, very much.
The competition is only going to get harder
and it's been pretty hard already.
Overall, I've had a lovely time.
It's been fun.
I've cooked more in the last few days
then I have certainly in my life!
I can't wait for the next round now.
I feel so relieved.
And I'm just so happy I've got another chance to do more dishes
and do more cooking.
I'm absolutely made up. It was fantastic.
But I'm under no misconception, I have got to learn and learn fast.
We've got quite a bit in store for you three.
Good luck.
Tomorrow night, the battle continues,
as these three celebrities get thrown into the deep end
of a busy restaurant service.
You've got number five on order, yes?
Take them out, you'll burn them otherwise.
Quite an expensive mistake.
Ah, oh la la.
I feel like I'm getting hammered here, mate.
