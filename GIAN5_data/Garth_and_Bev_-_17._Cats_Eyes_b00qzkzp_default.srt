Garth and Bev
Wait till you see what happens
Garth and Bev
You're going to love what happens!
Mmm!
It looks like the moon!
So it does.
Which reminds me, young Bevan.
I think you're old enough to come to your first
full moon ceremony tonight.
BEV GASPS Yay!
Here, puss, puss, puss!
Oh, Cirica!
Here, kitty. Where are you?
I'm going to the full moon thingy.
Well, I'm not.
Not until I find my cat.
Pshht, pshht! Where are you?
Cirica!
But, Elva, you must come.
It's a special celebration at the Stone Circle tonight.
We're adding a new stone.
Really? But, Lir, I'm so worried about her.
She's been acting very strange recently.
Not as strange as Elva.
Shh!
Don't worry, Elva.
I'm sure my grandchildren will help you find her.
Aw.
I'd join the hunt myself,
but I've got to go and tell Fiann where to dig the hole
for the new ceremonial stone.
Well, I'd certainly have something to celebrate tonight
if you can find my precious Cirica.
What does she look like?
  She looks like a cat!
Not just any cat.
She has beautiful bright green eyes
and jet black fur.
  My poor Cirica.
If you discover something new while you're at it,
there might be time for a little treat.
  The Time Spiral?
  Can we travel to another time and place?
We'll see.
Good luck!
The clue is in the eyes.
What's that up there?
It might be Cirica.
Cats don't live in trees.
But they like to climb them and so do I!
Oh! Sorry, birds.
Nope, not up there.
Hmm. I wonder where Cirica goes to sleep.
Breck's always complaining about cats sleeping in his baskets.
Let's go and look.
I haven't seen a cat today,
but one could have got in while I was out.
Go on, have a look.
Just don't knock anything over.
It's taken me all day to stack this lot.
Shh!
SNAP! Huh!
Oh! Ah!
  Huh!
  Ooh!
Um, er, ah,
that's deep enough, I think, Fiann.
Thank you.
No trouble.
Right, then, I'd better be getting back to the farm.
See you later, Lir.
Now.
I wonder how my grandchildren are getting on.
Ahh.
That's enough cat hunting, I think.
Especially when the cat is a pig!
Sorry, Breck.
Never mind. Off you go, find your cat. Not you!
I'd better take you back to the farm.
We can do that, if you like. Elva's cat might be at the farm.
Thanks so much for finding my piglet!
  What were you doing at Breck's?
Buying baskets?
Fiann, have you seen a cat today?
Elva's has gone missing.
Oh, dear! Cirica often comes here looking for milk,
but I haven't seen her today.
Ahh!
Cirica must like milk as much as I do.
Have you got any more?
Bev!
It's not for me.
We can use this one for Cirica.
Good idea! Let's go. We'd better find her before it gets dark.
You might find it easier in the dark.
Come on, you!
What does he mean?
  Here, kitty. Here, Cirica.
  Here, kitty.
Here, Cirica.
Ow!
Baa!
Thanks a lot, Niall.
The milk's spilt.
Now how are we going to find Elva's cat?
AND we haven't discovered anything new.
It's nearly time to go to the Stone Circle, too.
The Stone Circle!
That's the one place we haven't looked.
Come on.
Ooh!
It's really dark.
I wonder why Fiann said, "It might be easier in the dark"?
Don't know. I can't see anything.
Grandfather Lir said, "The clue is in the eyes."
Hmm.
Oh, look, Garth!
Candles!
They're not candles, Bev.
They're...
cat's eyes!
They're shining in the moonlight.
Cirica, we found you!
I knew you'd work it out.
So, it must be time for a little treat.
The Time Spiral, yes!
In another time and place, you'll meet with someone face to face.
They've discovered something new and solved a problem,
just like you.
A fine piece of work, Percy.
  Hey! And who might you be?
I'm Garth.
And this is my sister, Bev.
We're from another time and place.
Well, I'm pleased to meet you.
I'm Percy Shaw.
You've picked a top time to arrive.
I've just invented summat very useful indeed.
What is it?
It lights the way on roads in the dark.
I've called it the cat's eye.
I was driving home on a very dark night.
I couldn't see me hand in front of me face.
Then two bright spots flashed in the dark.
Oh!
  It were a cat's eyes
reflecting in me lights.
Very handy to have around, cats.
This one stopped me driving off the road in the dark.
Good thing, too!
So I set about inventing something to put on roads
that reflect light at night,
like the cat's eyes did.
I thought of using mirrors,
but they break too easily.
So I worked out that glass beads would do the trick.
See, the back of a cat's eye reflects light that shines on it.
And so does this.
That's how we found Cirica.
Cirica is Elva's cat.
So it must have been the moonlight reflecting off the back of her eyes.
That sounds about right.
We have to go.
Thanks for showing us your invention. Bye!
Well I never!
So he'd made these things to put on the road.
To reflect light at night,
like Cirica's eyes were reflecting the moonlight.
You know what I always say.
Nature has all the answers!
Oh, thank you so much for finding my Cirica!
Where is she?
In the hole for the new stone.
  Oh, yes,
I I I almost forgot,
  Stop!
  Stop! Stop!
  Stop!
  Stop!
There she is.
But look,
there's more cat's eyes!
  Oh!
Oh, no wonder you'd been acting strangely, Cirica.
Why didn't you tell me? Hah!
There's more to celebrate that we thought.
Oh!
Oh, meow! Oh, purr!
