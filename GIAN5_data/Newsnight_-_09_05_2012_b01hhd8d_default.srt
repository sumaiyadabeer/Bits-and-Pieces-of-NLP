As programmes of legislation go, it was pretty thin, in today's Queen's
Speech, the Government promised some pensions reforms, a bit of
business law reform, and a promise from the PM to look after the
country's strivers. It is less than a mile, and more
than a dream from the fancy dress of Westminster to the estates of
Lambeth. What connection is there between what the Government
promised today and what people on Royal Street really need. We have
the chairman of the Conservative Party, and the shadow Justice
Secretary. Despite the handshakes, it is chaos
in Greece, part 94 we will have the latest from Athens. Beautiful, I'm
worth it. Oh yes, as shareholders begin to tell bosses they can't
just pay themselves whatever they like, we talk to the Business
Secretary about why he thinks he knows better than the market. To
its defenders it is enhanced interrogation techniques, to others,
waterboarding is torture. We hear exclusively from the CIA boss who
chose to destroy tapes of its existence. It is not a pretty sight
if you are waterboarding anybody or using these techniques. And you are
screaming and you are vomiting? don't know about screaming or
vomiting, it is not a pretty sight. Also tonight: The one eyed look
modern hairdressing has died. Nicky Clarke will join us.
It is wet and grey and we're back in recession, time to send Her
Majesty in a horse drawn carriage through London, to read out words
of what the Government will do to make our lives immeasurably better.
Unfortunately the Monarch's speech, which lays out the Government's
laws and plans, can't do much about the appalling state of the economy,
on which just about everything else depends, was the journey really
necessary. What does stkrat Stratton think.
What do you get when you    Allegra Stratton think.
What do you get when you take a lady on the road. Her Majesty
forced her way through the pomp and pageantry to Westminster, to read
out the Government's programme, this one is meant to be for the
strivers. Are you a striver? don't know what it means. Are you a
striver? Yeah. Do you know what it means when a politician says they
are working for the strivers, would you say that is you? I'm not sure.
Are you a striver? A what, sorry? striver? No. Do you work hard and
play within the rules? Am I, a striver, of course, yes. I didn't
mean a skiver. Don't get the wrong end of the gold stick, it was this
year particularly at odds with the events' message. Government has
tried to bend the Queen's Speech to address the cost of living. It   
there was a shopping list for the struggling family, an adjudicator
bill, reform of the electricity wart. It is a Queen's Speech for
the doers, the strivers, those who work hard and play by the rulesment
we are reforming welfare so it pays to have a job. We want to do more
to reward responsibility. We are lifting two million people out of
tax, but we want to go further to help Britain's strivers, we have
introduce free schools, and academys, but we want more
opportunity, that is what the Queen's Speech is about.
pollster will tell you why. Recently the Cameron think tank
Policy Exchange asked YouGov to poll 2,500 families in the north
and south of Britain. They asked what would be the most helpful
thing politicians could do to improve their lives. The
respondents were allowed more than one answer.
They asked for a reduction in energy bills and fuel duty, they
were the most popular things. The Government recognises they have
been guilty of an sing a concept actual error on the economy. They
know they haven't talked about about living standards, because
they thought their voice was implausible. Funny you have a
leader of an opposition who won't talk about deficit but jobs and
growth, and the Government the other way round. That is changing,
today instead of deficit and instead of something like the Big
Society, the Prime Minister emphasised the striving class, the
leader of the opposition went for the jugular. They should have put
an economy that helps working families at the centre of this
Queen's Speech, but they didn't, water bills, the cost of getting to
work, that is what is at the heart of the people. What have the
Government got to say about it? Absolutely nothing. An energy bill
with nothing to help people struggling to make ends meet. No
legislation, no legislation...no legislation this year on water, no
legislation on train fares, nothing to relieve the squeeze on ordinary
families. Some people in Government think this is just going to get
worse, you have the feel good factor of the Jubilee and the
Olympics coming up, and in August that feel good factor is wiped
clean when there is an increase in fuel duty. They say if you really
wanted this Queen's Speech to be about addressing living standards,
you needed a big vivid tech any colour bill, whacking the energy
companies to take down the bills. They say none of this will be easy
in coalition policies, to bring down bills you have to look at
green policies, and the coalition party will not let the Tories get
away with that. Tonight there was signs of internal tensions, a
letter written by Nick Clegg to Lib Dems MPs, saying they had punched
above their weight in their contribution in the Queen's Speech.
It went down very badly with Tory colleagues. Other Tories rallied to
the new attempt to talk about living standards. This evening's
backbench meeting of Tories, the 1922 Committee, rounded on Nadine
Dorries, for her suggestion that Cameron and Osbourne were too posh.
When you make that decision it might be well to ask yourself, are
you better off than you were four years ago? This moment inspired
George Osborne when he was masterminding the 2010 general
election campaign for the Conservatives. He placed centrally
data showing the average British income had fallen in the previous
five years under Labour. Then he said it was the first time it had
happened during a parliament of modern times. By seeking to reclaim
this territory right now, the Government is not necessarily
making life easier for itself. Across all the parties people are
recognising that the deeper trends, which are bearing down on the
working population, certainly the bottom half of the working
population, will not be solved by any legislation today or any policy.
They are long standing, and not just happening in blin but other
countries too,    but in other countries too. There is also the
incredibly elusive nature of growth in this country, both of which
means that there are people inside Government who have contemplating
going into the next election with living standards having fallen.
They don't necessarily think this means death for them. They think if
they can have signified to people that they are on their side through
crime, welfare, immigration, then living standards going down is not
necessarily the end. We have lived through three decades of rising
growth and boom. That is over. That will put a squeeze on living
standards, and make it difficult for democratic politicians to
promise the electorate that they will always get richer. That makes
it important that the values of this coalition become more and more
important, and we need to demonstrate, with every day that we
are committed to the strivers and that we're on the side of the
people trying to get on and do the right thing and take responsibility.
Another Queen's Speech down, and with it a new overture has been
made. It's by the Government to the
strivers of Royal Street. The Conservative chairman, Baroness
Warsi, and Labour's Sadiq Khan, are here to work out whether a
perfectly happy goat, in fact, died in vain for the vellum that the
speech was written on today. You must be delighted with    you must
be not happy with Nick Clegg saying it had a Lib Dem stamp on it?
referred to the manifesto, the enterprise bill was in the
manifesto, the reform to banking, dividing out retail banking from
the more casino style banking, that was in the manifesto, the stuff in
relation to families, adoption, support for children with special
educational need. That was in the equalities compact in the manifesto.
A lot of what we developed in opposition, I was delighted to see
in the Queen's Speech. What are the many, many things that David
Cameron would like to do that he's unable to do because of the brake
that is put on him by the Liberal Democrats? If I can give you one
example, it is the British Bill of Rights. We have a commission at the
moment, which has representatives which are either Conservative or
Liberal Democrats, and it is, I think, it has been difficult to try
to move that forward. There would have been a British Bill of Rights
in the Queen's Speech had you not been in coalition? I can't predict
that, that is the kind of thing we would be seeing much more of in a
way. That would be presumptionably with a view to getting rid of the
Human Rights Act? It is about us effectively saying these are our
rights, we want to enshrine them, and do them in the form of a
British Bill of Rights. In line with our obligations under the
convention. And at what point did you give up the commitment to cut
red tape? It is actually in the bill. The words are in the bill?
the enterprise bill, it is actually cutting back    Enterprise Bill, it
is cutting back the regulatory burden on small businesses. There
are 16 new quangos in this speech? They are not wrong, it is when they
don't do the job they are put there to do they are wrong. The groceries
one, let's take that as an example. It is the supermarket ombudsman?
What you have at the moment, you have small business, a lot farmers
and rural businesses, supplying to big supermarkets, they negotiate a
contract, and there have been occasions when the contracts are
changed retrospectively, those suppliers are not paid on time, and
not paying a small supplier on time can mean a business can go bust. It
is important there is a Code of Practise and a regulator who
enforces it. All the new one, the health research authority, London
health involvement board and so on, they are also equally vital are
they? We have presented a series of bills into second phase of the
legislative programme. What is interesting is today we
have...Let's Sadiq Khan speak. 15 bills in one form or another, how
many of them will you support? lot about depend on the detail. A
lot we welcome. We welcome the fact that the Government is doing far
more in relation to the green investment bank, we are
disappointed it will take until 2016 before the first person can
borrow from this. We welcome the fact. Presumably all those things,
like tax relief on charity donations in buck buckets on the
street, maybe even the supermarkets' ombudsman? On the
charities' Gift Aid point, George Osborne is trying to repair the
damage he did with a clumsy attempt to put a cap on the relief again.
The point about the Queen's Speech, the answer gave it away, this is
more about relations between the two coalition partners than meeting
the needs of Britons today. Where are the bills in the legislation
that will address the cost of living. Where are the bills in the
legislation that will deal with rip off charges. And those that
deal with the young unemployed. One in five young people is unemployed,
where is the legislation to deal with that. Unlike the Labour, and
Sadiq Khan, I don't believe the answer to everything is another act
of parliament. When we came into Government. The House of Lords
reform. When we came into power there were 167 acts you guys had
passed and nothing had happened. I don't think the Labour idea of
passing another act of parliament and then it is done. His basic
point that people's pain is an economic pain and you can't solve T
you recognised it in the Queen's Speech, you can't solve it by bits
of legislation. The economy is in recession, how much that is your
fault and other people's fault we don't know, we can argue about that.
You can't do anything about t you can't get people to come back and
vote for you on the basis of this? We have already started to do
things to help people with the cost of living. Council tax freeze, nine
out of ten Conservative councils have done that across the country.
Changes in relation to income tax, which has taken the poorest out of
income tax, making sure they have more in their pockets at the end of
the year. That's taking, that's putting money back into people's
pockets. Making sure we keep a grip on the nation's finances, so we
keep interest rates low, why, to keep mortgages low. A 1% increase
in interest would mean �1,000 to an average family's mortgage bill for
a year. That is how you protect. But not legislation? Legislation is
not the only answer. If you lock at legislation introduced this time,
whether the energy or water bill, that will have an impact in the way
in which consumers pay, both for electricity and for water. That
will have an impact in people's pockets. One of the things in the
Queen's Speech today was the Finance Bill, which will pass the
decision by your Chancellor to reduce the top rate of tax for
those earning above �150 though though how is that helping the
ordinary    �150,000, how is that helping the ordinary man and woman
striving as you say today. class war issue comes to the
forefront. Why are you helping the people. How is that class war.
are you helping the people who pay 50% or 45%. Let me tell you, we
live in a global world, I will answer the question. Answer his
question about how that helps ordinary people? I will tell you.
We live in a world where when businessmen look at places to
invest, they look at London, they look at New York, they look at
Paris, they look at Berlin. I want people to say, London is the place
to invest. I will tell you why, if people invest here, because the
right climate is created for business to invest here, that will
create jobs, and it is jobs that improve people's lives. You can
either create a climate. Let him get a word in edgeways. If one out
of five people between 16 24 are unemployed, if young people are
more out of education, out of employment and training, if less
young people are going to university, do you really think
reducing the top rate of tax from 50% to 45% will lead to big
business coming to this country. You need to think about the needs
of ordinary hard working people, and those who can't work, those who
want to be strivers and want to work hard, what are you doing to
help them. You had a golden opportunity and you wasted it?
were in a Government that presided over a 40% increase in youth
unemployment. I'm not going to take lessons from somebody who was in
the last Labour Government who presided over one of the worst
records in relation to unemployment. Look, ultimately, we can sit here
and have this argument, and I'm sure we will do this for many
months to come. It takes two to argue. Ultimately what we need to
look at is how this Government has already made changes over the last
two years, some of it legislative, some of it doesn't need legislation,
to start getting this country, first of all to stablise the
nation's finances and get the country growing again.
Thank you both very much. As the Government ploughs on with
the important matters such as the exact powers of the new groceries
ombudsmen, across the world other concerns weigh more heavily.
Another day of falling markets, rumours of Spanish bank
nationalisations, and political uncertainty. At the centre of it
all is Greece, which may account for less than 2% of the European
Union's he economy, but accounts for much more than 2% of its
problems. We're in Athens, what is happening there tonight?
attempt by the grouping that came second in the elections, the left 
wing grouping, Syriza, to form a Government, has now failed. I think
everybody expected it, they even expected themselves they would fail.
Because their conditions were just really unacceptable for the other
main parties. They wanted a complete tearing up of the bail out
agreement, as well as an investigation into what caused the
deficit, and an investigation into the banking. That simply wasn't
going to happen. Now it is the third placed party, PASOK, the
socialist who is get a chance to try to form a Government. They want
a national unity Government that would ensure that Greece can stay
in the eurozone. If that fails, there will be talk of a
technocratic led Government, like Greece had before. But increasingly,
Jeremy, I think the feeling is here that Greece probably will have to
have new elections, and those are elections in which the anti bail 
out parties f that election happens, may do even better still.
What about the rest of Europe? have heard from Spain, as you
mentioned one of Spain's main banks is going to be partially
nationalised. That is because of fears in the long run that Spain,
like Greece, may also need a bail out. So really enormous be
uncertainty here, a big question really, how much uncertainty the
institutions responsible for the bail out. The IMF and the EU, how
much uncertainty they will be allow. We have heard tonight that one part
of the next installment of money that is supposed to go to Greece,
one billion euros supposed to go tomorrow, will be withheld. That is
said to be on grounds that Greece doesn't necessarily need the money
immediately. That is being seen as a political warning that this bail
out isn't unconditional. The boss of Britain's biggest
insurance group has already had to pack his bags and trouser a massive
pay off, after shareholders said they wouldn't put up with his
latest pay package. Bosses of two other businesses have been forced
out. Now what is nicknamed the Shareholder Spring, is going to get
legal backing. Among the laws the coalition says it will introduce,
is one which will give shareholders power to block top pay awards. It
is the Business Secretary Vince Cable's baby, we will hear from him
in a moment. Why just colour your hair when you
can soft colour it. 30 years ago an advertising slogan became
synonymous with a new generation of self pampering. It might be the
catch phrase of top executives all around the world.
Back in the early 1980, the ratio of a chief executive's pay to that
of the average salary in that company was around 30 1. Now it is
around 110 1. That's nothing, the ratio in the United States is close
to 500 1. We saw in the 1980s was the rise of the generation I have
auld the L' oreal generation, they got it because they were worth it t
they deserved T it was at a time of massive change, post big bang,
businesses were taken into balance sheets that didn't show and stayed
with the individual. They blessed the very top of organisations,
these were the elect, the people you had to pay the most and retain
for the longest. But just as the stock market crash
on Black Monday in 1987 burst the then bubble, the financial crisis
of four years ago has acted like a retreating tide. Revealing those
swimmers not wearing any trunks. Last year 60 FTSE 100 chief
executives saw their typical pay pack packages rise 11%. Total pay
for the economy as a whole rose by a 1.1%, to a more modest salary of
�25,000. All the while the benchmark FTSE 100 Index fell by
6.6%. Suddenly the owners of big
companies, for example their shareholders, have realised they
are using money hand over fist, while the people they employ to
handle it are coining it. Fund managers who manage pension pots
for millions of us, have suddenly had a "smell the coffee" moment.
Some of their votes against generous remuneration packages of
top executives have claimed some scalps. There have also been
warning shots across the boughs for Bob Diamond, and William Hill boss,
and the week is young. Just like other fads from the 1980, could the
recent Shareholder Spring last no longer than hull la hoops or
executive toys. No long it is the hula hoop of corporate Government,
we are entering a world of accountability, social media is one
of the big factors that really drives this. There is no turning
back. Vince Cable wants to force shareholders to take binding votes
when it comes to remuneration, not advisory ones. Hopes by making
votes on executive pay compulsory, it will force top bosss to work
harder or earnless. Believe it or not UK shareholders
have quite an amount of power, they don't tend to use it. They could
fire the chairman of the renumeration committee that sets
executive pay, they usually don't. They could vote against the share
plan of the chief executive, but they don't. They could throw all
the toys out of the pram and get rid of the entire board. How often
does that happen. If you make executive pay votes binding from
now, which is the plan, will that change anything. If they ask us to
vote on complex bonus plans and share options, we will throw our
hands up in horror and vote with the board. If they ask us to set a
limit over which someone cannot earn, a mult pel    multiple of X
in the middle, there is a chance it will have an impact. We as
shareholders can accept the maximum and minimum we are prepared to
accept people taking away. While capitalism was alive and well in
the 1980s, it faces something of a crisis these days in western Europe.
Ironically there is no such doubts in emerging giants such as Brazil
and China. They are rich today, but considered Third World countries
three decades ago. Maybe they will start worrying about executive pay
in 20426789 A little earlier I visit    2042. A little earlier I
visited Vince Cable's office in Westminster.
You referred to ludicrous levels of top executives' pay in terms of
reformance? I had in mind    Performance? I had in mind, as
identified by shareholders groups a lot of dissatisfaction. One thing
is pay getting way out of line with performance. The other thing is
most executives trying to get into the top quartile. Which by
definition they can't. There has been a pay escalation. The concept
of ludicrous, this is identified by the shareholders themselves. We
have seen a rebellion. It is your word, I was wondering what examples
you were thinking of? You have seen the examples of the last few days,
William Hill, a few weeks ago, Barclays, others. You mean Bob
Diamond is paid too much? That is what his shareholders thought.
word is "ludicrous", do you think Bob Diamond was paid a ludicrous
amount of money? I have my views, but as a Government minister what
is important to me is we have the right set of rules so the people
who own Bob Diamond's company can vote on whether they think the pay
is too high or too low. 60% of them thought the pay was fine? There was
a lot that didn't, there was a sufficient number to cause serious
alarm. I think this is happening across. If there is a majority who
think is pay is all right, it is all right? That is up to the
company itself to decide. If the chief executives and the directors
of the company, in particular, feel that there is a strong expression
of dissatisfaction amongst the people who own their own companies,
they are likely to react to it. This is exactly who we have seen,
it is healthy. This is shareholder democracy, this is the way
companies should be held to account. My job is to set the rules. That is
why your views matter, of course? We are reinforcing the views of the
shareholders, by introducing legislation to give them a vote
that is binding and not merely advisory. The majority view of
shareholders in that case was that he was entitled to what they
considered an extravagant amount of money, if they decide that, what
business is that of your's? It is not my business, it is their
business to decide what they want to do with their company. What is
Andrews quit majority? The question about whether    An adequate
majority? The question is whether. What do you suggest? I have
suggested there is a strong argument for going over 50%, there
are arguments about 75%, even remaining at 50%. What we are doing
at the moment is talking to the investor community and business,
about what would be a sensible figure to judge a binding vote by.
For you, this isn't really a question of performance of the
company, there is a moral question, isn't there? It is about the
performance of companies. Actually I may have moral views about
executives of companies. company performing spectacularly,
the chief executive can be rewarded spectacularly? That is right.
isn't a moral view? I may have moral views, but my job is to
create a framework of corporate governance, under which people who
own companies exercise their responsibility and do so
executively. When a Conservative backbench today MP describes your
prejudice on the matter as being liberal, left wing claptrap, what
do you think? That is frankly way out of line with the majority of
opinion I'm a picking up in the business community. The last time I
had the pleasure of being in this building, I came in and asked you
if you knew what the slogan was down in reception, you couldn't
remember, and why should you, it was some dreary thing about cutting
red tape. I see it is gone now. There is no slogan about cutting
red tape? There is lots of slogans about Great Britain. There are lots
of statements of various degrieves meaning and vacuity, the one about
cutting red tape is no longer there. This particular measure will
introduce a whole lot more red tape, isn't it? It won't introduce red
tape. How can it not? How will it? The idea that people who are
shareholders are entitled to exercise a bill that is binding
doesn't require a lot of regulation. As I say I have just been talking
to the investor community, who are the people who will be using these
powers. Not a single one of them raised the objection that it would
create more red tape. That is not the issue in this particular area
of policy. One final point. It is your birthday, happy birthday, we
will draw a veil over how old you are. May you have many years to
come. When you think about retirement, I suppose you will be
able to retire to the House of Lords, it will still be there by
the time you get around to it? proposal of the Government is it
will still be there, but it will be elected, whether I feel by seeking
election in my advanced years a different question. An elected
House of Lords, you really think it will come about within how many
years? If this legislation proceeds in an orderly and fairly rapid way,
as I think it should, it could come into effect in the next parliament.
We hope that parliament picking it up. Some time before 2020? I would
hope so, I'm not managing that particular piece of legislation.
will be around for you for a good while yet, won't it, in its present
form? I have been in parliament for 15 years, every year this has been
debated. All the three parties are broadly agreed on what they think
ought to happen. If people are sensible this long overdue reform
could be put through in a reasonably rapid and efficient way.
Vince Cable, thank you. It has emerged that it looks like
it will be a year, maybe more, before the man America believes was
behind the September 11st attacks is formally put on trial, charged
with 2,976 murders. The US Government admits he was
interrogated under called waterboarding, simulated drowning,
which the US claims isn't torture. Now Newsnight has discovered that
secret CIA video tapes of a called high value Al Qaeda detainee, Abu
Zubaydah, apparently waterboarding, shows him vomiting and screaming.
The tapes were destroyed by a senior CIA officer, who has given
us an, inclusive interview. Water border, that is stimulating
drowning, was the most extreme element in the CIA's highly
controversial interrogation techniques used to break Al Qaeda
detainees. Jose Rodriguez was the man who ran the top secret
programme in the days immediately after 9/11, when fears of a second
strike were all too real. For many the programme was torture. It is
not a pretty sight when you are waterboarding anybody, or using any
of these techniques. Let's be perfectly honest here. One detainee
was water boarded 83 times. The CIA video taped what he went through.
He was experiencing some physical difficulties, I'll just leave it at
that. What the tape showed was potentially devastating, should
they ever become public. Rodriguez destroyed them. I am proud of the
decisions that I took. Including the detrux of the tapes.    Detrux
of the tapes. In an exclusive interview for Newsnight, Jose
Rodriguez gives a tis durbing insight into the CIA's secret
programme and the cover up that followed. America's detention
centre at Guantanamo, has become synonymous with the war on terror
and its abuses. President Obama promised to shut it down, but has
been unable to do so. Instead he's now having to use Guantanamo as a
site for a military tribunal to try the architect of 9/11, allegedly,
and four of his co conspirators. Torture will become one of the most
contentious issues at the trial. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is one of
the most evil men I have come across. He was seeking different
ways of trying to kill us, and kill our allies. Today, the painful
memories of 9/11 are reflected in the new memorial garden on the site
where the twin towers once stood. But other dark memories followed as
the CIA hunted down Al Qaeda. In the months after 9/11, the White
House was determined to do all that it could to prevent another attack.
And it took an unprecedented step. It authorised the CIA to use
aggressive and highly controversial techniques at its black sites.
These enhanced interrogation techniques were designed to break
the prisoner, and Abu Zubaydah was to be the Guinea pig. Abu Zubaydah
was a planner and a facilitator. He was a senior Al Qaeda person. Also
very smart. Abu Zubaydah was seized in Pakistan, six months after 9/11,
and rendered to a secret CIA black site, thought to be in Thailand.
Zubaydah was the first high value target to be captured. Initially he
was interviewed by the FBI, who didn't lay a finger on him. He
revealed to them the identity of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. But the CIA
thought he was holding back. were dead in the water, he had
should down, he was not talking.    he had shut down, he was not
talking. We needed to come up with an alternative set of techniques,
that would convince the terrorist that he had no control over his
situation. That his fate was in our hands. The CIA's top lawyer
believed it was essential to have the secret techniques authorised at
the highest level. Oh, I had considerable hesitation. That was
the entire reason, frankly, that I made the decision to make sure that
we were not going to conduct these kinds of clearly unprecedented
activities, without the full and complete legal and policy approval
of the highest levels of the Bush administration.
A confinement box, like a dog kennel was constructed, and Abu
Zubaydah was shut inside in total darkness for hours on end.
And he was subjected to the most extreme technique, being water
boarded 83 times. US Government lawyers claimed it, like the other
technique, was lawful, because the pain and suffering weren't severe.
A top secret legal memo to John Rizzo from the Department of
Justice, describe the process in chillingly mundane detail.
individual is bound securely, the water is usually applied from a
canteen cup, air is now slightly restricted for 20 40 seconds, this
action, plus the cloth, produces the perception of suffocation, and
insipient panic, the perception of drowning. And Abu Zubaydah's
captivity and interrogation were recorded across 92 video tapes.
Some showing him undergoing the techniques in graphic detail. Do
you regard them as torture? I do, personally. I think they fit almost
any definition that anybody has of torture. A year after Zubaydah's
capture, the CIA finally closed in on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. In 2003
he was captured in Pakistan, and flown to a secret black site for
interrogation. It was thought to be in Poland. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
was probably the toughest detainee we ever had. And he was going to
resist to the ends of his strength. In an effort to break him, he was
deprived of sleep for more than a week. Wearing a nappy and forced to
stand naked. Finally, he was water boarded 183 times. Isn't that way
above the inflix of pain and suffering, 183 applications? Khalid
Sheikh Mohammed would start counting with the fingers on his
hand, to let us know that the ten seconds was about to come up.
Because he knew that usually that was when it stopped. That doesn't
sound like a man who was concerned about dying, does it.
I did not anticipate that the waterboard, whenever it was used,
would be used as often as it was. After a few weeks Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed finally reached breaking point and started to talk. These
terrorists have huge egos, they can't wait to tell you how smart
they are, how capable they are, how evil they are. But at some point,
they give it up. In his case, when he gave it up, he just would not
stop talking. I knew what was happening to our detainees, you
couldn't help but drive home every night and say I wonder if this is
the direction we have to go. And then you would see the faces of the
fallen in the New York Times, and read the detainee reports that came
in, that helped us prevent plots, then you say OK, there is a child
who may grow up in New York city or Los Angeles with parent who may
otherwise have lost a parent. Rodriguez insists the techniques
worked. He says he confirmed the intelligence that finally led to
Osama Bin Laden's hideout, and provided details of plots to attack
Los Angeles, Heathrow Airport, and can Nairy wharf. But the use of the
techniques, subsequently produced an explosive fall out. 12 of the
CIA's tapes showed Abu Zubaydah and another prisoner being subjected to
the techniques, including waterboarding. Jose Rodriguez
decided to stop any future recordings, and the 92 tapes were
locked away for three years. When news of the black sites leaked out,
Rodriguez decided to shred them. Why did you destroy the tapes of
the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah? I did it to protect the officers,
whose faces were shown in interrogations. Was that the only
reason you destroyed the tapes? Were you authorised to destroy the
taifps?    tapes? Our lawyers said it was legal. I was stunned and
angry, and honestly a bit hurt. I made it clear to him, as did two
CIA directors, that he did not have the authority. It was not his call
to make a decision to destroy those tapes. So he disobeyed orders?
did. Up until now, what was on the CIA
tapes has remained a closely guarded secret. But, it is a secret
no more. I understand they show Abu Zubaydah vomiting and screaming as
he's being waterboarded. What did the tapes show about his reaction
when he was being waterboarded? don't know, but the reaction, they
were the tapes of the interrogations, I don't know what
his reaction was as he was waterboarded. Did you see those
tapes? No I did not. Rodriguez says his interrogators
insist there was no vomiting or screaming. John Rizzo sent a senior
CIA lawyer to watch all the tapes. The lawyer concluded they were in
accordance with the legal guidelines, but it was disturbed by
what he saw of Zubaydah. I'm not going to get into specifics, but he
was reacting visibly. In a very disturbing way. Was he being sick?
He was not ...he was experiencing some physical difficulties, I will
leave it at that. Was he screaming? That I do not know. But not easy to
watch? No, he told me they were very, very hard to watch.
Tough to watch, I believe, is his term. Two days after the tapes'
destruction, there was a secret CIA memorandum, it subjects that
protecting the identities of the interrogators was not Jose
Rodriguez's only concern. As Mr Rodriguez said, the heat from
destroying is nothing to whatever it could be if the tapes ever got
into the public domain. He said, out of context they would make them
look terrible, and it would be devastating to them. You must have
been aware of what those tapes showed in order for you to believe
that the effect would be devastating? It is not a pretty
sight, when you are waterboarding anybody, or using any of these
techniques. Let's be perfectly honestly here. And you are
screaming and vomiting? I don't know about screaming or vomiting,
but it is not a pretty sight. you say if the tapes were viewed
outside of the CIA and became public, they would make us look
terrible, and it would be devastating, did you say that?
course I said that, yes. If you are waterboarding somebody and they are
naked, of course, that was a concern of mine, yes.
The trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and the alleged 9/11 plotters, will
arouse conflicting memories. Memories of 3,000 lives lost on
9/11. And memories of the methods used in America's name to bring
those responsible to justice. That is Peter Taylor Reporting. A
couple of hours ago the death was announced of the household name,
Vidal Sassoon. He began life as a poor boy in London, and discovered
dead at his home in Los Angeles, he was 84, and synonymous of the style
of hairdressing that freed women from a form of tyranny, and gave
them liveable haircuts that fitted the lives they were increasingly
leading. If you are not trying to be safe you will be more
progressive and get more done, it works that way. This presumably why
you have a name in fashion and other people don't? To tell us what
he felt about Vidal Sassoon, one of Britain's best known hairdresser,
Nicky Clarke is here. How significant a figure was he? Hugely
significant. Probably the most iconic of all hairdressers.
Certainly, I mean, the hairdressers that are around today, myself
included, have a huge debt to this man. He changed the way people felt
about hair. What was it he did? think mostly, if you take back that
time, he became particularly famous in the early 1960s, 1962 prior to
that people were in rollers and backcombing their hair. In terms of
being freed, what he brought was a different kind of hairdressing, it
was all about the cut. It was all about simplicity. It was all about
modernism. And in some ways it defined the 1960s. If we think of
the 1960s we think of Vidal Sassoon, and the Beatles and Carnaby Street.
He helped to put London and Great Britain on the map at that time.
was the British look, in many ways? He really was. A defined a look
that was truly original. There is no doubt about that. I think to do
that was kind of making him the iconic figure he was today.
knew him, he was a friend? He was a friend, and he had become a friend
of mine in the last five years. Somebody that would come over to
dinner, and chew the fat. Was he a nice guy? He was such a lovely guy.
I have never met a more humble man. This is a man who truly love his
craft, believed that    loved his craft, believed that anything
anybody was doing was good was good for the industry, and ultimately
good for this country as well. He will be really sadly missed. I'm
truly saddened, I only found out earlier tonight. He is going to be
missed greatly. And the fact that London, in particular, Britain in
general, but London in particular is the world centre for
hairdressing, how much of that, do you think, is attributable to him
and his hairdressing? It started with him. He along with Raymond,
were probably the start of that period in the 1960s where people
became interested in hair. They were interested in designers and
fashion. And they saw a different kind of look. We think about being
able to give that time to somebody that was tr from the wrong side of
the tracks. He was a young Jewish lad, along with the likes of David
Bailey, Duffy and Donovan, they were the Cockney boys able to make
their mark. He will be much missed? Certainly. I feel really sad for
the industry, but most of all I feel sad for his wife, Ronnie as
well, it will sink in to me later. I shall go through all my old
pictures as well. He's just a lovely man. I can't imagine anybody
having a bad word about him, even before tonight. Thank you.
that happens a whole lot of blue out there, we know what that means,
a pretty wet start to Thursday. It will stay that way across Scotland
and Northern Ireland. For England and Wales things will pick up.
Particularly across the central and eastern areas. Temperatures
shooting up into the mid to high teens in other places, 20 degrees
possible. Damp in the south coast, and more the poors and south west
England a lot of fog around. Over in Northern Ireland it will stay
pretty grim all day long, a lot of cloud, a lot of rain, a cold north 
eastly wind pegging those temperatures back. A pretty bleak
scene across Scotland. I know it is the middle of pay May, but across
the Highlands and Grampians there could be snow. Looking further
ahead to Friday, across the north. Persistent rain will ease away.
Sharp showers, but some sunshine inbetween. Further south most of
the day. None too warm, a brisk north westerly wind. This is the
