Immie! Bathroom's free!
Who's left that open?
Hiya.
Oh! You scared me half to death!
What are you doing here at this time?
I was just dropping off some washing. I've got a lecture first thing.
There's a couple of smart shirts there.
Any chance I could pick them up tomorrow morning?
  Why the urgency?
  No reason.
Have you got a new girlfriend?
No! I just need some clean shirts.
Right.
I'll put the kettle on, and you can tell me all about her.
Where's all this water come from?
  Oh, it was like that yesterday. Hiya.
  Why didn't you tell me?
  Sorry.
  I better get off. I'll see you tomorrow.
The flaming pipe's leaking again! Immie? Will you get me a towel...
Jack!
  Monday? Why?
  Well, Heston's away but there's this important PCT meeting.
I was hoping you'd be able to make it.
Actually, Monday is not good with me. I have a lot on.
  Ordinarily I'd love to. Perhaps another time?
I'm sure Zara will be able to help.
Spare some change?
  You shouldn't creep up on people like that!
  Sorry.
And this is private property. So I suggest you rattle your can elsewhere!
Oh, cheers(!)
Can I get past, mate?
  You're even younger than I thought.
  Sorry?
Are you one of her students?
You're just a kid.
Oi! Don't walk away from me!
You're sleeping with my wife!
Look, I don't want any trouble, all right? Please?
  Sorry Julia, I would love to, but I really can't do Monday.
  It would only be for two hours...
I've got a prior commitment, it's important,
and I can't possibly get out of it. Next time you can really count me in.
But more notice would help. PHONE RINGS
Sorry, I do have to get this. Zara Carmichael speaking?
Hi! Thanks for getting back to me. How are you?
Funny, there's always a prior commitment when you want something.
  I'll have to go on my own.
  I thought they were supposed to be partners?
  They are.
They're taking the you know what.
They may like "partner" on their business cards, but are they doing anything?
Hello, Mill Health Centre?
Yeah. It's Sarah from the nursing agency.
Oh, right. Hi, Sarah.
Yeah?
'Please...'
Just leave her alone.
Can't you see what this is doing to me?
This is between you and Lucy. It's nothing to do with me.
Look, mate. I know it's hard but you've got to try and get over it.
You've been living apart for, what, months now?
Just face it. She doesn't want to be with you.
Is that what she told you?
That we're separated?
We still live together, we share the same house.
  I don't think so.
  You want proof?
I'll take you there. I'll show you the house.
But she said you'd split up.
And you believed her.
She wouldn't lie to me.
Right.
And you've known her for, what? Five minutes?
I've been with her for over 15 years.
D'you really want to be the one to destroy all that?
She means the world to me.
That's not how she tells it.
Oh, I'm not perfect. I know that.
No marriage is.
And things haven't been good between us for a while, but...
I know we can get through this.
If only you weren't on the scene.
I want to have kids with her.
I want to spend the rest of my life with her.
Can you give her that?
You're just a kid yourself.
D'you really want to settle down with a woman twice your age?
Have kids before you've even left uni?
Before you've even done anything with your life?
Finally! Better late than never.
Right, well...
if that's everyone,
we may as well get started.
Stick another one in there, will you, mate?
  Good, you're here. I want to talk to you about the meeting.
  Sorry, I can't.
I've just got to fetch Izzie.
It won't take long. It's not too much to ask for you to come to the meeting.
You are partners.
I told you, I can't. I have an appointment with social services.
Oh. What time?
I don't know. They're calling Monday morning.
But it's a very important case, I have to be there.
  Well, that's fair enough.
  Can I go? Thank you.
  Zara?
  Mmmm? What?
I've got a prior commitment. We've already had this conversation.
  Can't you re schedule?
  No.
  Is it a work commitment?
  Is that relevant?
  Yes.
It's personal.
Oh. Well, I've checked the rota
  and you're still down to come in on Monday.
  Yes, but you see,
  I've swapped with Jimmi, he is covering.
  Did you get an appointment?
  Not now, Cherry.
  What appointment?
  It's nothing, really.
  Oh, come on, Zara!
No. What's this all about?
Oh, has she not told you? She's been trying to get an appointment
with this celebrity hairdresser, whatshisname, he does Cheryl Cole. So you're seeing him on Monday?
  Oh, really? Do tell me.
  Yes, I am.
So this is the pressing personal commitment you couldn't reschedule?
  Having your hair done?
  Look, Julia.
He is, like, one of the top stylists in the country,
and I have been waiting for months to get an appointment.
Right. Yes. I must have my priorities all wrong.
I should take Monday off and have a manicure.
I'm sure the PCT can reschedule(!)
  Julia, wait...
  Roberto Calvini, that's his name!
You did this on purpose, you poisonous little dwarf!
I'm sorry, was it supposed to be a secret?
You knew perfectly well it was. You made me look like a complete idiot!
Come on, Zara. You would have done exactly the same to me.
So in this case, the crucial element for the court of appeal
was whether there'd been an innocent misrepresentation of the facts
or if the defendant had lied knowingly.
Excuse me.
Sorry everyone, something's come up. That's it for today.
Jack?
  Are you OK?
  Me? I'm fine.
What's going on? Why were you adamant about meeting here?
Why not? We're both adults. We've got nothing to hide.
Aren't you going to give me a kiss?
What's gotten into you?
I bumped into your husband earlier. He sends his love.
What's the matter? Worried I'll cause a scene?
You've been drinking.
You lied to me, Lucy.
  You knew I was married.
  You said you were separated.
You still live together!
I'm sorry.
But at least give me a chance to explain. Please.
But not here.
Very clever girl.
In we go.
  SHE GASPS Hello! Who's this?
  This is Izzie.
  Izzie, this is Elaine.
  Hi! Can I have a hug?
Oh, thank you! What a good hugger!
  Yeah.
  You must be very proud.
I am. She's my little munchkin.
I know you've been through a lot. You both have.
  Tell me about it.
  Hey, Izzie! Izzie!
Karen, there's some guy going through the bins outside. Could you get rid of him?
  Come on, darling.
  Since when was that my job?
Oi! What d'you think you're doing? You can't hang around here. It's private property.
  I'll only be a minute. I won't leave a mess.
  What are you looking for anyway?
Anything I can use, really. People throw a lot of food out.
Well, don't eat out of there. It's dirty.
I'll get you some biscuits but then you have to go.
  Have you got any paper you could spare?
  Newspaper?
Any kind. I've run out.
Did you leave that thing on my desk? The ori...wotsit thing?
  Did you like it?
  I did, actually.
  Does that mean you're the one that took my chocolate?
  Um...yeah.
  Sorry about that.
  I thought I was going mad!
  Why'd you do that?
  I was hungry.
I don't normally steal things.
Honest.
I'm Clem, by the way.
  I'm Karen.
  Oh, sorry.
  Come here.
  You're bleeding.
  It's nothing.
  Let me see.
There was some broken glass in the bin.
Come on. Let's see if we can't get the nurse to take a look.
Here comes Mr Horsey, what noise does he make?
  Clippity clop. And look, Mr Piggy. He goes...
Oh, and look, here comes the big old miserable moo cow.
Mooo!
  Having fun?
  Look, Izzie!
  It's Auntie Zara!
  Hello, you! Come and give me a cuddle.
Oh! She likes you! She must know something we don't.
Is that a new dress, Izzie? It's lovely.
  Cherry? Can I borrow you for a sec?
  Yeah.
What is that smell?
  Hello again.
  Oh...hello.
Cherry, this is Clem.
  He's cut his hand. Would you mind having a look?
  Yeah, sure.
Wait, who's looking after Izzie?
  It looks like you are.
  I don't think so!
Karen, could you just hold her for a minute? And Mr Cow!
And I will get Daniel.
Do you want to come through this way?
Coming to your auntie Karen. Is that all right?
Why can't you just be straight with me?
OK, yes. We do still share a bed.
But we haven't had sex in months.
We just share the same space, that's all.
We're going through the motions, Jack.
There's no passion any more. It's over.
You expect me to believe you can share a bed with your ex and feel nothing?
Do you think I'm that naive?
All right. If you want the absolute truth...I feel sorry for him.
That's why we're still together. I didn't want to hurt him.
So you do still care for him?
Of course I still care for him! We've been together over 15 years.
But we fell out of love a long time ago.
  And then I met you.
  So basically you were bored.
  No!
  I came along, I was convenient, the sex was good, so you thought, why not?
  Might as well string him along.
  OK! Maybe it was a bit like that at first.
But then I really started to fall for you.
It didn't stop you lying to me.
I didn't mean to.
Look... I didn't plan any of this, Jack.
Maybe it was like that at first, but not now.
And what about your husband?
Cos he genuinely still seems to love you.
He's talking about the two of you having a family together.
What?
He's never been interested in having kids before.
Do you want kids?
  Yeah.
  And if he wanted them too, would you get back with him?
Am I just a fall back plan?
  A sperm donor?
  You're not listening to me!
I shouldn't have lied to you, Jack.
But I mean this.
I love you and I want to be with you
and if the only way to prove that is by leaving Grant then so be it.
We could get a place together.
Screw the university, I don't care if everyone knows.
You're the only thing that matters, Jack.
I want to be with you. I love YOU.
  Sorry, Karen. Couldn't get off the phone.
  That's all right.
Hello, lovely.
What are you doing? A jigsaw? Oh, look, Mummy's got purple hair!
OK, let's do the corners first.
Sorry, it's a patient for you. George Clark.
  Can you take a message?
  Says it's urgent.
  You can look after Izzie.
  Julia?
Thanks again. I'll find my own way out.
OK. Bye.
What I suggest, Mr Clark, is give the paracetamol time to take effect.
If the knee pain doesn't improve, you could make an appointment and come and see us.
OK? Thank you. Bye.
Unbelievable!
Izzie?
  Karen! Where's she gone?
  Who?
  Izzie. You were supposed to be looking after her.
  Me?
  I was talking to Julia.
  What?
  Hey, calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
We can start over.
No secrets this time.
I promise I can make it all right.
You know what I've been through these past few months.
The last thing I want is to be in the middle of another broken relationship,
  let alone the cause of one.
  You're not.
My marriage was over long before you came on the scene.
I know it's a mess,
but being with you has made me realise what I really want.
You're my future, Jack.
It's you I want to be with.
No. I'm sorry, I can't. It's not right.
She's probably hiding, you know what kids are like.
She's right. Try and stay calm. We'll find her.
Don't tell me what to do! She's my daughter!
  Please take it easy.
  Stop saying that!
Can't you see what's happening? She's gone!
Look, who was the last person to see her?
I saw her in reception with Karen. But I've been in my room ever since.
She can't have gone far. There's only five of us here and Elaine's patient.
  And Clem.
  Who?
Clem, the homeless guy Karen brought in.
What the hell was he doing in here?
  He'd cut his hand.
  When did he leave?
  A few minutes ago.
  You don't know that's connected.
  Did you actually see him leave the building alone?
  No.
  I don't believe this.
  He's just a kid. I'm sure he's got nothing to do with this.
I hope you're right, because if he's laid a finger on my daughter, I'll kill him.
  Kids go missing all the time.
  If anything's happened, I'm holding you responsible!
  Daniel? What's going on?
  Izzie's gone.
  Someone's taken her.
  We don't know that.
  This wouldn't have happened if you'd have done what I asked!
  I didn't hear you!
Daniel, that is enough! Karen, go and help the others please.
  It's happening again!
  This is not happening again.
She must have wandered off. We'll fine her.
  What if she doesn't come back?
  She will. We will find her.
Listen to me. Even if we have to tear this place apart.
Everything is going to be all right.
I promise.
  Just give me another chance, please!
  Let me go.
I love you! I know you feel the same way.
Get this through your head. You were a bit of fun.
I never saw this as long term. The sex was great, but that was it.
Go back to your husband. He's your best bet now.
How can you be so cold?
Cos I don't love you. You were just an easy lay.
Izzie?
Izzie?
Clem?
Please...
I haven't taken her.
Nobody thinks you have.
But I heard what that guy said.
He's coming after me.
He's just upset, that's all.
  Izzie...? Where is she?
  No, please!
  Don't!
  Where is she?
  Daniel, stop it!
  We've got her! We've got Izzie!
She's here. She's safe.
She was in the back room, playing hide and seek.
Don't ever do that to me again!
I'm sorry about the way Dr Granger spoke to you.
S'all right.
I'm used to being in the way.
  Hey! Don't say that, you're not in anybody's way.
  You make a nice cuppa.
My son says that.
You remind me a bit of him.
He's lucky, having a mum like you.
I don't know that he would always agree with that.
Why?
It's a long story.
Let's just say we haven't had the best time of it recently.
What about you? Are you in touch with your family?
No.
What happened?
Long story.
Maybe you'll go back, and work things out.
Some things you can't fix.
They're broken and you just have to move on.
Yeah.
  You are going to be all right, aren't you?
  Course.
I can look after myself, you know.
What are these things?
Do they mean something?
They're currency.
I haven't got anything to give people.
If someone helps me, I can't pay them back with money.
So I give them one of these.
I figure kindness and beauty cost nothing.
But they're worth a lot.
One tiny thing and I'm a raving maniac.
It's understandable,
after what happened.
I'm...so selfish, because you went through all that too.
But she's not mine.
Is she?
I don't know what I'd do without you sometimes.
You save me from myself.
Oops! Whoa, there we go.
Ohhh! So.
What next?
  Is it home time?
  Yep. We're getting ice cream.
Would you like that?
Thank you.
  Come on, you. Say goodbye to Zara.
  Bye bye!
Bye bye.
Mum?
  Oh. I didn't know you were coming home today.
  Washing.
Something smells good. Is Mum back already?
  No. I'm making dinner.
  Are you ill?
No. I just fancied spending some time with you and Mum.
It's only spag bol.
Sorry, I can't tonight. I was just coming in to get changed then going back out again.
Oh, right, well...
Have a good night.
  See you tomorrow.
  Night.
  Night.
Any plans for tonight?
A long bath and a large glass of red.
You were very impressive earlier, by the way.
  Was I?
  With Daniel.
You've got a way with him.
I suppose.
He's lucky to have you.
You're full of surprises, Zara.
I like to think so.
  You coming?
  In a minute.
Night.
Oh. I thought you'd gone.
I just wanted to let you know.
I'm going to cancel that hair appointment on Monday.
So if the offer still stands I would like to come to the update meeting.
You were right...
I should be there.
Oh, OK. Well, that's great.
I'm glad. Thank you.
  Hiya, love.
  Hi.
Are you all right?
  Yeah, fine.
  No, you're not.
  What's the matter?
  Nothing.
Is this about me and your dad?
No, Mum.
It's all right.
It's fine.
Grandad!
Whoo hoo! Come on!
We can cope with anything that's thrown at us. Thank you, people.
  People?
  Thank you, people?
  People.
  You can't get it twice, Grandad.
  I know that now.
Better to say nothing than the wrong thing.
Especially when you're nervous.
I'm not nervous!
No.
