Welcome to Breakaway, a race to this finish line.
There's £10,000 to be won.
Will today's players stick together and win together
or break away from the pack in a bid to win everything for themselves?
Today's six players are:
Hi, I'm Sally. I'm a PA from the West Midlands.
I'm Jonathan, a primary school teacher from Rotherham.
Hi, I'm Naomi and I'm a student from Barnsley.
I'm Tom, a chartered surveyor from Edinburgh.
I'm Charley, I'm a writer and publisher from Leeds.
My name is Wayne, a salesman from Northumberland.
Please take your place on the start line.
30 correct answers stand between you and the finish line.
With every correct answer, you will win £100 for the communal prize pot,
to be split between you all at the end.
But any one of you can, if you choose,
break away from the pack.
And if you cross that finish line,
the entire prize fund could be yours.
If you break away, every question is worth £300,
and you might've worked this out, but that's three times as much.
However, answer a single question wrong
and you risk instant elimination.
The final nine questions could be about anything at all.
But before I start asking you those questions,
you have an important decision to make.
You'll be given the chance to break away now
and after every three questions.
You can see the break points marked on the track.
You have five seconds to decide.
Only the person who buzzes in first will break away.
If you break away now,
before the question has even been asked,
I will throw in a £1,000 bonus
for the chutzpah that you show.
So for the chance to win £10,000,
does anybody want...
..to break away?
Good! You're a team! All right?
So today's seven categories are there on the screen.
Your first subject is...Drinks.
You will have 15 seconds to answer each question.
One, and only one of you,
must step forward and give me the answer before that time runs out.
  Are we happy? Are we ready to play?
  Yes.
Question one.
  Go for it.
  Jonathan steps forward. Jonathan?
  I believe it's Earl Grey.
  Earl Grey.
You had a good discussion.
Is the answer Earl Grey?
Yes.
£100. Well done. The relief is palpable.
  It certainly is! It's the first one!
  Very happy.
Question two.
  Blackcurrants.
  You go, Charley.
  Yes, absolutely.
  Go for it.
  Charley steps forward. Charley, the answer.
  Blackcurrants.
  Is the answer blackcurrant?
Well done.
Well done. £200 you have between you.
Working really nicely as a team. Question three.
  Sparkling?
  I think it means dry.
  It's to do with dry. You've got demi sec...
  Ten seconds.
  It's to do with how sweet or dry it is.
  If you're happy, Tom...
  Tom?
  It's dry, Nick.
  Tom says it's dry.
Is the answer dry?
  It is.
  Well done.
  A perfect start. Three questions, three correct answers.
  Well done, team.
We're at the first breakpoint.
But before you decide whether or not you might break away,
there is something that might influence your decision.
This is your first chance to win yourselves a life.
Lives are very important. I always stress this.
If you're on the break away track, one incorrect answer risks elimination.
A life will protect you from that.
With this question, you're playing against each other.
You've just become a team, but I'm asking you to be individuals.
The first one to buzz in and answer correctly wins a life.
The question's always the same. Who, where or what is this?
This football team plays in the English Premier League in the 2011/12 season.
They are one of the most successful in English football history,
having played in the top division since 1919
  and winning...
  Charley?
  Manchester United.
Is the answer Manchester United?
  No, it's not.
  Good try, though.
  Charley sits it out.
They've won the league 13 times, as of 2011.
  Sally?
  Would it be Liverpool?
Is the answer Liverpool?
The club was founded in 1886
  and used to have...
  Wayne.
  Arsenal.
  Is the answer Arsenal?
Well done.
Well done, Wayne. Wayne has a life.
Because you have a life, you get to choose the next category.
Classical Music, Hobbies & Games, Pop Groups, World Cup Football, UK Prime Ministers, Human Body.
  Choose one.
  UK Prime Ministers.
UK Prime Ministers. Sometimes people choose a really strong category
because they're planning to break away.
The reason I mention that is, we are at a break away point.
You could stay as a team, go all the way through as a team
and have £3,000 to share between you.
But if you were thinking about breaking away
and you went all the way through on your own,
you would have £8,400 for yourself.
Would you like to break away?
Not for now. UK Prime Ministers is the next topic.
Maybe you thought, "I don't fancy being on my own with that!"
Question four.
  '79, yes.
  Are you sure?
  I think you're right.
  I thought it was the '80s.
Eight seconds. Wayne steps forward.
  Is the answer 1979?
  Well done.
  Perfect. Four questions, £400.
Question five.
TOM & Anthony Eden. Definitely.
Tom, go for it.
  Tom steps forward. Answer?
  It was Anthony Eden.
Anthony Eden.
  Well done.
  Brilliant.
  Working beautifully as a team.
Question six.
  Churchill.
  Neville Chamberlain.
  Then it was Churchill later.
It's definitely Chamberlain.
  Charley steps forward.
  Neville Chamberlain.
Is the answer Neville Chamberlain?
Well done. A perfect start.
Six questions. £600. All doing very, very well.
We are at a breakpoint.
Now is the chance for another life to come into the game.
Some people decide to break away just on how many lives they have.
They think, "Once I've got two or three or four or five"
and there are five lives out there, they'll break away.
Those lives, whatever happens, will protect you once you get over here,
should you get a question wrong.
Who, what or where is this?
This former Conservative politician was born in Bath in 1947,
attending the Royal Navy School in Singapore and later studying at Oxford University.
Once Shadow Home Secretary...
  Wayne?
  John Major.
Your second life, if it is.
No, Wayne. You're out of the rest of this question.
Once Shadow Home Secretary...
  Sally?
  Was it William Hague?
Was it William Hague?
  Once Shadow Home Secretary...
Jonathan?
  Is it Kenneth Clark?
  Is it Kenneth Clark?
No, it isn't.
This privy councillor was MP
for Maidstone and The Weald until 2010
  and she's... Tom?
  Ann Widdecombe.
  You say it's Ann Widdecombe.
  Is it Ann Widdecombe?
  I'm pretty certain.
Well done.
Well done, Tom. Tom gets a life.
You can bring a new life into the game,
so you have a life and Wayne has a life,
or you can take Wayne's life off him.
  I'd like a life of my own.
  OK, let's bring a life in for Tom.
Tom, you've won the life. That means you get to choose the next category.
  I'd like Pop Groups, please, Nick.
  Pop Groups.
Strong subject for you?
  A terrible subject!
  Terrible, he says!
Which would indicate maybe he's not thinking of breaking away.
But maybe it's a big bluff. We'll find out.
I'm going to ask you THAT question.
If you were to break away now, on your own, go through the tape,
£7,800 to take home on your own.
It may well be worth sticking together
and going through the line together.
You would have £3,000.
The question is,
does anybody want to break away?
Fine! You stay together as a team for these next three questions.
Question seven.
Westlife or Boyzone.
Down to ten seconds.
  Boyzone?
  I think it might be Westlife.
Seven seconds. Five seconds.
  I think it's Boyzone!
  Wayne has stepped forward.
  Boyzone.
  You've gone for Boyzone. Is the answer Boyzone?
Well done.
Well done! Well done! Can't fault you.
Question eight.
  Jenny Frost.
  Well done, guys. Go for it.
Wayne steps forward.
It's Jenny Frost.
Is the answer Jenny Frost?
  Well done.
  Well done indeed.
One more question on Pop Groups before we reach the next breakpoint.
Question nine.
Was it Geri Halliwell?
I think it may have been Geri Halliwell.
  I really don't know.
  10 seconds!
  Could it be Scary?
  Five seconds!
  It sounds more like Geri Halliwell.
Three seconds! Two seconds!
  Naomi?
  Geri Halliwell.
  Is it Geri Halliwell?
£900. Nine correct answers. Time for another life.
Our third life.
Wayne has a life, Tom has a life.
It's like having car insurance. It makes you feel a little safer.
Who, what or where is this?
This planet is the sixth largest in the solar system in terms of size and mass.
It was known in Ancient Greece by two different names  
Phosphorus, when it appeared as a morning star,
and Heosphoros... Charley.
  Venus.
  Is the answer Venus?
Charley, you've got a life. Do you want to bring a new life in
or would you like to take a life from Wayne or Tom?
I'm just not that nasty.
  I'm going to ask for one of my own.
  Thanks.
Let's bring a new life in for Charley.
Tom, Charley and Wayne have lives. Charley gets to choose the next category.
Can we have World Cup Football, please?
World Cup Football.
So bearing in mind that the next three questions are on World Cup Football,
I'll ask you the break away question.
If you go through the line together, you will win £3,000.
If you break away at this point and go through on your own,
Does anybody wish to break away?
As it stands, we're all still together.
OK? Perfect start. Let's not muck it up now.
Question ten.
Vuvuzela.
Naomi? She stepped forward before I'd finished reading the question,
she was so keen!
  Vuvuzela.
  Is the answer vuvuzela?
Yes, it is. Well done.
Another £100. Question 11.
  It was definitely Gary Lineker.
  Yes.
Tom steps forward. "Definite Tom", as I like to think of you!
"Definite this, definite that!" The answer?
It's definitely Gary Lineker.
  Definitely.
  Fantastic.
  Well done!
£1,100. Question 12.
  15 seconds.
  I have no clue.
  No idea.
  It was definitely Japan.
  Definitely Japan?
Definitely? OK, go for it.
  Tom, if you're happy with it.
  Seven seconds!
Whaa!
  Definitely, Nick, it was Japan.
  Was it Japan?
£1,200. You've kept it up. Really, really good start as a team.
Two more lives to go.
Let's go for that penultimate life.
Who, what or where is this?
This is a city in the UK, with a population of approximately 310,000.
In 1944, it became the first city in the world to twin with another,
Volgograd, which was then called Stalingrad.
It is an industrial city in the West Midlands...
  Sally?
  It has to be Birmingham.
Is the answer Birmingham?
Oh, my God!
You're frozen out.
  It is an industrial city...
  Wayne?
  I'll say Manchester.
Straight in on the back of Sally.
Is the answer Manchester?
It is an industrial city...
Jonathan.
It's the only other city I'm hoping is in the West Midlands and that is Coventry.
Jonathan says it's Coventry.
  Well done, well done.
  Yes!
Sorry. Geography and me is not a good subject.
You did very well. You can bring a life into the game
or you can take a life from Wayne, Charley or Tom.
I think we're working so well as a team,
  I'm happy to take a new life.
  A new life comes in for Jonathan.
Jonathan, you get to choose the next category.
Hobbies & Games, Classical Music, Human Body.
  Classical Music, please.
  OK. Now, that often causes a little bit of nervousness.
Don't let the subject necessarily put you off
when I ask the next big question.
£6,600 is where we're at now
if you were to break away and get through.
The earlier you go, the more money you will win.
Does anybody want...
..to break away?
Interesting. None of you looked at each other!
We're a team again.
Get a question wrong, remember, that money goes.
Question 13, on Classical Music.
Myleene Klass.
Go on, you go.
  Charley?
  Myleene Klass.
Is the answer Myleene Klass?
Well done, well done. Another question done.
Really rattling on.
Question 14, Classical Music.
  Hold it!
  Is it mezzo soprano?
  It's prima
  donno.
  No, prima donna.
Charley, you seemed very certain. The answer is...
  Prima donna.
  Is the answer prima donna?
Well done, well done.
Great knowledge between you. You work nicely as a team.
Question 15.
Tchaikovsky!
Yes, Tchaikovsky.
  Naomi?
  Tchaikovsky.
  Tchaikovsky.
Is the answer Tchaikovsky?
  Well done.
Naomi, they usually push you forward when they're not sure!
Very, very, very, very good. Perfect start.
This is really, really impressive.
We have one more life for you to win.
The question, as always, who, what or where is this?
This sitcom began in 1994 and ran for ten years.
It was created by David Crane... Sally.
  I got very excited. Is it Friends?
  You got very excited about Birmingham last time!
Is it Friends?
Yes! Finally!
Now, Sally, you have got a life.
You can bring a new life into the game
or you can take a life from Jonathan, Tom, Charley or Wayne.
This is really hard. I'm going to go tactical, it's not personal,
but could I take a life from Charley?
Ohh! OK, OK.
  Charley, how do you feel about that?
  Erm...
Well, it's each to their own, isn't it?
  It's kind of a compliment.
  She's competition.
  She sees you as a threat.
Charley's life comes across to Sally.
It's the first chink I've seen in this team,
the first fracture.
Sally has to choose the next category. Hobbies & Games or Human Body.
  I think I'll go for Hobbies & Games.
  Hobbies & Games.
We're reaching a key moment now, when I've got to ask that key question.
You can still stay together   £3,000, and share that between you.
If you get a question wrong on the way,
we go back down to zero.
Break away now on your own, go through   £6,000.
A first crack has appeared in the team.
I'll ask the question. Does anybody...
..want to break away?
Tom has decided to break away.
Come and join me on the break away track.
Tom, you're here at question 15. There are 15 questions left.
If you get through, you could win £6,000 for yourself.
But the question is, definite as you are,
can you get all the way there on your own?
It is a long way.
Would you ask somebody to come and join you?
  I don't think so.
  You don't think so.
OK. Well, the next time we reach a breakpoint,
you'll have a chance to change that and maybe ask someone to join you.
15 questions to go. £300 each on this side.
  Good luck.
  Thank you.
  Question 16.
Chess   not one of my strong points.
Only 15 seconds for you.
Five seconds. You need to step forward and answer.
Three seconds.
  Tom goes for 12.
  If it isn't 12, you lose a life.
  It's not!
Is the answer 12?
The answer is 16. Take a step back. You're still in the same place.
  You lose a life. You're not out of the game yet, though.
  No.
But before you can ask somebody to join you, you need to get through these three questions.
Get any one wrong, you're out of the game and on your way home.
  Definitely.
  Understood.
Question 16.
Answer?
  Ludo.
  Ludo. Was Ludo originally known as the Pluto Platter?
The answer, Tom,
is the Frisbee.
  Ahh!
  Anybody over there know it?
  Wayne did.
  Wayne knew.
If Wayne had come with you, you might've been all right.
As it stands, Tom,
  I'm afraid the game's over.
  Thanks.
  Cheers, Tom.
Usually, when somebody breaks away and goes off,
I ask the pack to come and join me,
but the money is exactly the same, we're in exactly the same place.
Hobbies & Games. £100 over there, remember.
Question 16.
Ouija!
  Ouija board, yes.
  Definitely.
  Absolutely. A Ouija board.
  Sally?
  It's a Ouija board.
  Ouija board.
Is that the correct answer?
  Yes, it is. Well done. £100.
  I haven't used one!
£1,600. Still a perfect team.
Question 17.
  Play well?
10 seconds.
  Rubik Cube?
  No, no, no, no, no!
  That's named after a person.
Five seconds.
Quick! Somebody's got to go forward!
  Shall I just go for it?
  Sally?
  Play Doh.
  You're going for Play Doh.
Remember, if you get it wrong, you go down to nought.
Is the answer Play Doh?
Take a step back.
  The answer is Lego!
  What?
  Lego. It's a Danish toy.
  That was tough.
All right, guys, you had £1,600.
  You now have no pounds.
  Never mind.
That really changes the dynamic of the game.
Sally put the first crack in the team by taking Charley's life.
Then we lost a member.
Now we've got no money.
We'll get back up there.
Still question 17.
I think it's four! I'm pretty certain.
  Go on, Jonathan.
  Jonathan?
  I think the answer's four.
  Is the answer four?
Well done, well done, well done. £100. Back up and running.
I notice now it's, "I think it is" and "We think it is"!
Definite Tom has gone and nobody's definite any more.
Right, question 18.
  Stamps.
  Definitely?
  Absolutely.
  Go for it.
Step forward. Charley?
  Stamps.
  Is the answer stamps?
Well done. Well done. £200. We've reached the next breakpoint.
Let's see what the final subject is. Human Bodies.
But first, I'm going to ask the big question.
Stay together and go through, £1,400 to share between you.
If you break away now and get through the finish line on your own,
We've seen one unsuccessful break away.
That doesn't mean that your break away won't be successful. Don't get left behind.
Does anybody want...
..to break away?
So Wayne has chosen to break away.
Come and join me on the break away track.
You have broken away
on question 18.
There are still 12 questions between you and the finish line.
£3,800 could be yours, if you get there.
But the question is, do you believe you can get there on your own?
You can ask one person to come and join you.
  Not at this point.
  Not at this point. OK.
  It's the Human Body. What do you do for a living?
  I'm a salesman.
  You don't sell...
  Human body parts?
  That's what I was going for!
Question 19.
15 seconds. Step forward when you know.
  Wayne?
  They're in your feet.
Is that the correct answer?
Yes, it is. Six years ago, nobody would've known that!
Then you get a World Cup and everybody knows it.
Another £300. The money cranks up. Question 20.
He steps forward straight away.
  Hiccup.
  Is it hiccup?
Well done, Wayne. A stark contrast to Tom when he was over here.
One more question to a breakpoint. Question 21.
15 seconds. It's an "ology".
  You've stepped forward. Answer?
  I'll go for the kidneys.
You're going for kidneys. Is it the kidneys?
Well done, well done, well done.
Another £300. We're up over the £1,000 now.
On the way to £3,800 if you can make it all the way.
Well, you did that perfectly. You didn't need any help there.
From now on in, though, just nine questions remain
and from this point the questions are pot luck.
They can be on any subject matter whatsoever.
Because this is the tense finish to the show, you get 30 seconds to answer each question.
Wayne, do you want to ask anybody to join you?
  No. I'm going to go for it.
  Your privilege, Wayne.
I wish you luck.
Question 22.
  Straight forward.
  Liquid Crystal Display.
Liquid Crystal Display. Is that correct?
Well done, Wayne. Well done indeed. OK.
Question 23.
God...
Erm...
  I'm just going to have to go...
  OK, Wayne.
I know it's not right, but Ronnie O'Sullivan.
  I know he's from London.
  Is it Ronnie O'Sullivan?
Remember, if it isn't, you lose a life.
Is the answer...
..Ronnie O'Sullivan?
You've already taken that step back. The answer...
  ..Steve Davis.
  Ah!
  Steve Davis.
  Wayne, you lose a life.
  Very vulnerable now.
They've got their eyes on you. They think they're coming back.
They would like to thank you for earning them some money.
Tom never managed to do that.
  Wayne, are you ready?
  Yes.
Question 23.
30 seconds.
  Wayne steps forward. Answer?
  Yellow.
Wayne says yellow. Looks confident. Is the answer yellow?
Well done, well done, well done.
One more question, you're at a breakpoint.
You can ask somebody to join you. You need to get this question right, though.
If you get it wrong, you're out of the game.
Question 24.
30 seconds.
  Wayne steps forward. Wayne?
  This is a total guess.
  It's gonna be Bill and Ben.
  Wayne says Bill and Ben.
  If it was not Bill and Ben, Wayne, you're on your way home.
  All right.
Is the answer Bill and Ben?
Did you know the answer? What was it?
  The Wombles.
  The Wombles is the correct answer.
If you'd had one of those people with you, you might've got through. I really admire your bravery.
  Thanks, man.
  Bad luck.
  Cheers.
  Thanks, Wayne.
Good luck.
Well done. You're back in. Question 24. Come and join me.
Come and stand up here. Money has been earned for you.
£1,700 is yours now. All right?
One wrong, as we know   it's happened to us  
  that £1,700 goes down to zero.
  Come on, team.
One more question till we reach the breakpoint.
Question 24.
Ivy League.
  Definitely. Go for it.
  Naomi?
  Ivy League.
  Ivy League, says Naomi.
Is Ivy League correct?
  Fantastic!
  Well done. £100.
We're up to £1,800.
We've reached the breakpoint.
This has been a really even game and you've worked as a team the whole way through.
Well, I say that... Sally did pinch Charley's life, but other than that,
you've worked as a cohesive unit.
You may be thinking, "Let's go through that line. Let's stick together."
£2,400 if you go through between the four of you.
  It'd be worth doing.
But if one of you was to break away now,
£3,600 you could have all for yourself
if you got through these remaining questions.
So here is the question.
Does anyone want...
..to break away?
Jonathan has chosen to break away.
Come and join me on the break away track.
There are six questions left, all right?
£3,600 to get through there.
Can you do it? Can you get there and have all that money for yourself?
Or would you like somebody to come and join you?
I'd like to invite Charley to come and join me.
Charley, would you like to join Jonathan on the break away track?
If I still had my life, I might be tempted,
but greed doesn't seem to have got the others very far, so I'll stay with the team.
  Sorry!
  You are on your own. Charley has that privilege.
You're on your own. In three questions, there'll be another breakpoint.
  For now, with one life, you need to get through these three questions.
  Sure.
They're worth £300 each.
Question 25.
30 seconds. But no one to confer with.
Oh, boy! Straight away!
Step forward when you know or if you're ready to guess.
I can't for a moment think it's chicken. All right.
  OK, step forward.
  In for a penny...
  Give me an answer.
  Duck.
  OK. If duck's correct, it's another £300.
If not, Jonathan loses a life and is very vulnerable.
Is the answer...
..duck?
Where I come from, a young duck is a duckling.
Step back. The answer is pigeon.
Did any of you know pigeon?
  You're all nodding now!
  You're all nodding now!
  The truth is...
  I've lost a life.
  You lose that life.
You've still three questions to go to get to a breakpoint.
Any question wrong, Jonathan,
  you are out of the game.
  OK. I understand.
Question 25.
Honestly, you do pick them, don't you, Nick?
I don't pick them. They're randomly generated.
  Son of Lancelot...
  By the devil!
  Clearly!
I haven't a clue.
  I'm going to have to step forward.
  OK. Answer?
I just don't know!
Er, right. Erm...
  Alfred!
  Alfred.
  No idea.
Was Alfred the correct answer?
Anyone over there know the answer?
  Galahad!
  Oh!
  Galahad! Galahad! Galahad!
I'm afraid, Jonathan,
  you're out of the game.
Typical! Two men have come into your lives
and both left you with no more than you had before.
But you're still in the game with six more questions to go.
A real sense of solidarity before. A real sense of solidarity now.
£2,400 could be there to share between you
if you stay on that side.
If somebody was to break away...
Let's not even think about that. Three questions till the breakpoint.
Is all the nastiness gone between Sally and Charley...
  Yes!
  ..over the life thing?
I never said anything at the time!
No, no. All right. I'm glad.
Question 25.
  30 days hath September...
  April June  
April, June, and November, all the rest have 31... Seven.
  I'll go.
  Naomi steps forward.
  Seven.
  Is the answer seven?
Yes! Thank goodness.
£1,900. Another question down.
Question 26.
The Black Sea...
The Caspian is down the bottom and the Black Sea is at the top.
The Baltic?
  Baltic.
  Are we going for Baltic?
Sally steps forward. Sally?
  Baltic Sea.
  The Baltic Sea. We had a real trip around Europe!
Is the answer the Baltic?
Yes!
Well done. It was like Coach Trip!
Four questions to go.
One question until the next breakpoint.
Not that that would interest you...
Question 27.
Bad Girls!
  30 seconds.
  Really?
  I haven't a clue.
  It is.
  Shall we go for it?
  You go with what you're going to go with.
  Go for it.
  Was it Bad Girls?
  Sally says it's Bad Girls.
Is it Bad Girls?
  Well done, Sally.
  Well done.
Three more questions to get through that finish line.
But first, it's a breakpoint.
I'm going to ask the question, but I know you've put a lot of trust in each other.
Let's see if that trust is worth it.
Does anybody want to break away?
Well done. OK. Three questions to go.
Question 28.
  Obelix!
  Obelix, yes.
  Charley steps forward. Answer, Charley?
  Obelix.
Is it Obelix?
Is it Obelix?
Of course it is.
Another question done. Another £100.
Lovely, lovely, lovely. Let's keep positive!
Question 29.
  William Frederick Cody?
  Is that Charlie Chaplin?
Showman. US showman.
William Frederick Cody? Showman?
  US showman.
  Are we going to say Charlie Chaplin?
  I have no idea.
He's British.
  US showman.
  Oh, come on!
  15 seconds to go.
  14 seconds.
  PT Barnum?
  We can't lose this money!
Was he from the States?
  That's all I can think of.
  It's worth a guess.
Five seconds.
Four seconds. OK.
Right.
  Tell me what the answer is.
  PT Barnum.
PT Barnum.
If it's wrong,
you lose that £2,200.
If it is PT Barnum, you're one question away from the finish line.
Is the answer PT Barnum?
  Sorry, guys.
  It doesn't matter. We didn't know it.
I'm absolutely heartbroken. The answer is Buffalo Bill.
  Ohh!
  Buffalo Bill. I'm really, really sorry.
We've been here before, haven't we? We need to pick ourselves up, OK?
The money goes. £2,200 becomes...
Fresh start. OK. Question 29.
  Absolutely. It's the Quakers.
  Can I?
Step forward. Naomi?
  Quakers.
  Naomi says it's the Quakers. Is it the Quakers?
  Yes. Well done.
  Well done.
  Back in the money.
£100 is up there. We've reached a breakpoint.
I have to ask you THE question.
You could break away now. It'd be £400 for yourself.
Stay together, cross the line, £200 to share between you,
but at least you'd know you were still together.
Does anybody want to break away?
Charley has decided to break away.
Come and join me on the break away track.
If anybody has justification for shattering that trust, it's you.
  You had your life taken from you by Sally.
  I did.
Somebody has to make a decision at that point. There's £400 to be won.
It would've been £200 to share over there.
It kind of makes financial sense, doesn't it?
But, Charley, you can ask somebody to join you, if you would like.
  Charley, would you like somebody to join you?
  Yes, I would.
  Charley, who would you like to join you?
  Have a guess.
  Naomi, would you like to join me?
  Yes, please!
OK. Naomi, come and join Charley on the break away track.
It feels like payback! Does it feel like payback to you, Sally?
Well, if it was 2,200, I'd be a bit more upset, but...
  If it was 2,200, I wouldn't have done it.
Question 30.
Get it wrong and Sally can send one of you home.
She must send one of you home.
Step forward if you know the answer.
  Charley?
  Brooke Shields.
  Charley says it's Brooke Shields.
If it is Brooke Shields,
Charley and Naomi step through the line and win £400.
If it is not, one of them goes home.
Is the answer...
..Brooke Shields?
  Well done. Fantastic.
Get through that line! Well done. Come over here.
Great loyalty you all showed to each other.
Only two of you could share the money.
You've got your life to take home. It won't be a lot of use!
