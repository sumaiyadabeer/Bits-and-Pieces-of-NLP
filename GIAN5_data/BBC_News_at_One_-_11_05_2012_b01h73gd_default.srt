A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after five
young children were killed in a fire at their home.
Their father has been named locally as Mick Philpott, the Head of A
very large family. He escaped the blaze and fought along with
neighbours to try to rescue his children trapped inside.
I can't speak highly enough of the actions, both of the police
officers and the fire crew. Tragically, unfortunately, these
five children have died. The Prime Minister sent Rebekah
Brooks a message of commiseration when she was forced to resign as
Chief Executive of News International over the phone
hacking scandal. In Norway, the brother of one of
those killed on the island of Utoeya throws a shoe at Anders
Breivik during his trial. And an attack of extreme violence
and catastrophic consequences. A man who blinded his girlfriend is
sentenced to life in prison. To be honest with you, I don't feel
nothing towards him. Nothing. Because that's a feeling
and I don't want to have any feelings for him.
Every cloud has a silver lining. After weeks of rain, South West
England, the Midlands and parts of Yorkshire are no longer in drought.
Later on BBC London, as nearly a million more Olympic tickets go on
And gaze into the future of the Games. We glimpse what the Olympic
Park will look like in a years' Good afternoon. Welcome to the BBC
News at One. A woman in her 20s has been arrested on suspicion of
murder after five young children were killed in a fire at their
Philpott, well known in the area and who has a very large family.
The children who died were aged between five and ten, a sixth child
is in hospital. Police say their parents, neighbours and fire crews
all fought to rescue them from the first floor of the house in
Allenton. Phil Mackie reports. Black soot stains the it will tale
marker of the tragic scene where five young children lost their
lives. Just before four this morning, three fire engines arrived
to find parents and neighbours frantically trying to rescue them.
They pulled them out but couldn't save them. Very traumatic, very
hectic at the scene because everyone's trying to help. We are
trying to do a professional job, which we do do. It's very traumatic
for the firefighters involved, very tragic for the community and the
family in particular. We teal with it professionally while we are at
the incident, but then we go away as firefighters and human beings as
deal with it personally. The father of the victims has been named
locally as Mick Philpott, the Head of A large well known family. There
were eight people living inside that small semi detached house,
besides the five children who died two adults escaped and a sixth
child is being treated in a burpbs unit in hospital in Birmingham.
   burns unit. Police say a woman in her 20s has been arrested on
suspicion of murder, but at this stage, that's just one line of
inquiry. Don't read too much into that arrest at this stage. It's a
matter of a police inquiry where we've had to act very quickly and
what we need to do on occasions is secure and preserve any evidence
which may feature later on in the inquiry. For now, the most
important thing is to find out how the fire started and whether it was
done deliberately. Forensic teams and fire investigators are
searching throughout the house. There are also the first signs of
public grief. For five young lives lost earlier this morning.
Phil Mackie with that report and he joins me now from the scene. An
awful tragic story. The investigation is ongoing, as you
say, but what more can you tell us? Well, as you will have seen, some
terrible pictures there, this morning. A few moments ago, an
utterly distraught teenage girl came to leave some flowers outside
the house. You can probably see all the commotion that's going on in
the background as well, there's the fire and police investigations
which are going on at the moment and also people now extending their
sympathies, not just to the family and friends of the children who
died, but to the whole community as well. We have had a statement to
that effect from the primary school where the children went. But the
key thing at the moment is to determine how the fire started,
whether or not it was done deliberately and that is why those
investigations are going on here at the moment. We expect to have
updates throughout the day. Thank you very much.
The former Chief Executive of News International, Rebekah Brooks, has
confirmed that she received a message of support from David
Cameron after she resigned in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.
She also used to edit the Sun and the News of the World, and she's
been giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards.
Nicholas Witchell reports. She was Rupert Murdoch's protege.
The newspaper editor and executive who Prime Ministers were keen to
know and to count as a friend. Rebekah Brooks was summoned today
to answer questions about the world of politicians and the press.
Questions though which are constrained by her current position
under criminal investigation. You are under police investigation
in the context of Operation Weeting, Operation Elveden and also for
allegedly perverting the course of justice, is that true? Yes.
It was in July last year that she'd resigned as Chief Executive of News
International. She'd been arrested a few days earlier. She described
how senior members of the Government had expressed their
sympathy. I received some indirect messages from Number Ten, Number 11,
the Home Office, the Foreign Office. It has been reported in relation to
Mr Cameron that, I don't know whether it's true, that you
received a message of support along the lines of "keep your head up",
is that true or not? I don't think they were the exact words but along
those lines. Did you also receive a message from him via an
intermediary along these lines, "sorry I could not have been more
loyal to you as I have been, but Ed Miliband had me on the run", or
words to that effect? Similar, but again very indirectly.
Mrs Brooks was asked about the claim that she and David Cameron
had texted each other a dozen times a day? I have read this as well 12
times a day, it's preposterous, one would hope as Prime Minister or
Leader of the Opposition he'd have better things to do. Rebekah Brooks
and David Cameron met three or four times she said and texted each
other a couple of times a week. Everybody wants to know how his
signs texts are signed off, can you help? Occasionally he'd sign them
off, LOL, lots of love, actually until I told him it meant laugh out
loud and then he didn't sign them like that any more. Mrs Brooks was
asked about her social contact with the Prime Minister. They didn't pop
round to each other's homes, she said, they met occasionally. They
did discuss the phone hacking allegations once or twice, and at
Christmas 2010, the News International bid for BSkyB was
raised at a dinner attended by James Murdoch. Rather than
discussed at that dinner, it was mentioned and I think James
Murdoch's testimony said that and I was aware that it was mentioned.
Rebekah Brooks's evidence continues. The South West of England, the
Midlands and parts of Yorkshire are no longer in drought after the
wettest April on record. But, the Environment Agency says ground
water levels are still low across the country in parts of East Anglia
and the South West remain in drought with hosepipe bans in place.
I'm joined by the Environment Correspondent Jeremy Cooke. Explain
where the droughts have been lifted? This is something we have
noticed, it's been incredibly wet and the Environment Agency says
it's the wettest on record. What does it mean? In the last areas to
go into drought, the South West, the Midlands, parts of Yorkshire,
the news is good, they are out of drought. In practice, it's good
news for wildlife. This is an environmental drought in those
areas. Good news too for farmers. When there is a drought order, they
are restricted from taking water to irrigate their crops, they can grab
water now, perhaps store it when they need it later. The south east
and East Anglia, more rain is needed? Absolutely right. Despite
all this rain, the ground water levels in some of the reservoirs
and aquifers, the levels are still incredibly low after 18
exceptionally dry months remember and what people inside the water
industry are saying is, let's all look ahead to next winter. If we
have a third dry winter in a row, we've got a problem. Everybody
really is saying, let's wait and see what happens this summer, but
crucially for the areas most badly affected, it's all about next
winter. Thank you very much. The parent
company of British Gas, cent trika has indicated there could be price
rises in the coming year, probably by �50 for the average household

in gas and electricity bills over the summer.
A man who blinded his girlfriend during a savage attack has been
sentenced to life in prison. 33  year old Shane Jenkin attacked Tina
Nash at her home in Cornwall last April. The judge described the
assault as one of extreme violence with catastrophic consequences. Jon
Kay is at Truro Crown Court now. Sophie, one senior police officer
told me this was the most horrific case he'd ever heard of. Tina Nash
was subjected to a 12 hour ordeal which culminated, as he said, in
her losing her eye sight. She's heard in the last few minutes, that
the man who did it, her ex  boyfriend, won't be out of jail for
many years. I should warn you, you might find some parts of this
report upsetting. His was the last face she would
ever see. Just days after this picture was taken, Shane Jenkins
subjected his girlfriend to a brutal assault which left Tina Nash
completely blind. I feel like a ghost. You know, I
can hear everyone around me, but I can't even see my own hand in front
of my face. When I hear my kids, I can't... Erm, sorry, I can't see
their faces. At the time, Tina told me losing her eyes had ruined her
life. What do you think you've lost in all this? I'd rather not be here
like this. This afternoon, Tina emerged from court after hearing
that her ex boyfriend has been jailed for life and won't be
released until he's no longer considered a risk to the public.
Shane Jenkin was described by the judge as very dangerous. The court
heard he'd watched a horror film which included eye gouging the
night before his attack. This week, Tina invited us into her
home to see how she's turned her life around in the last year. She's
living independently again and proudly looking after her two
little boys. I'm the same me as what I was
before. So you've gone back to being who you were before this even
happened? Yes, I'm not going to change. No way. Our hearts went
out... Tina's sisters have read her the hundreds of messages of support
she's received from people all over the world. In our thoughts and
prayers... Tina's the bravest person I've met. She's absolutely
amazing, inspirational, she's got such a character and such a wicked
sense of humour. I don't think I'm brave. You don't think you are
brave? No, no, not at all. I don't think I'm brave at all. What do you
think you are then? How would you describe? I'm surviving. As for the
man who robbed her of her eye sight? I don't feel nothing towards
him. Nothing. Because that's a feeling and I don't want to have
any feelings for him. Tina says she is happy with today's
sentence and now plans to help other victims of domestic violence.
And and and there's something else she can begin doing now, that's
having counselling, having therapy, something she's not been able to
start yet because there was a chance she might be called to give
evidence in a trial and it couldn't interfere with her as a witness, so
now she can get on with her life, she told me she's looking forward
to learning to ride a horse again and she's also looking forward to
taking her two young boys on holiday.
The Spanish geeft is due to announce more reforms to clean up
its banking system    Government. It comes after the fourth largest
Spanish bank was part nationalised. The European Commission has warned
that the eurozone's economy is forecast to shrink this year, as
the debt crisis continues to bite. Our Chief Economics Correspondent,
Hugh Pym, reports. Spanish banks are being told to
carry out a major clean up operation, stripping out loans
which have gone sour and setting aside more money to cover future
losses. This week, the Government took
control of Bankia, the country's fourth largest bank. It was only
created last year after a merger of troubled regional savings banks.
The problem stemmed from the Spanish construction boom and bust
which saw ghost towns like this one near Madrid built and left largely
unoccupied with the banks still burdened with major losses.
Biggest problem in Spanish banking is mortgages. Most of the banks
have one single problem, that's mortgages. The price of housing
collapsed, so do the mortgage businesses and the banks are in
trouble because they can't meet the minimum capital requirements.
not clear what today's move will mean for Santander, Spain's largest
bank which has a presence in the UK after take overs of banks like
Abbey National. A spokesperson for Santander UK
said the business was fully covered by British banking regular laces
and investor protection rules. It's run as a subsidiary, autonomous
from the Spanish parent company with money raised in the UK staying
in the UK. Spain's problems are mounting.
Demonstrators are taking to the streets protesting about spending
cuts as the Government battles to cut borrowing.
Funding bank bail outs is the last thing it need and what's more, the
economy is in recession. The European Commission had little
cheer to offer with its latest The European economy is estimated
to be in a mild but short lived recession, and then subsequently a
slow and subdued recovery. What Spain badly needs right now is

It may only be a small rock in the middle of the South China Sea, but
it is at the heart of a growing diplomatic row between China and
the Philippines. Tension between the countries has increased in
recent weeks over who controls a group of small uninhabited islands
between the two nations. This week in what is being seen as a
provocative act, a Chinese journalist latter day flag on one
of the rocks, prompting thousands to take to the streets of the
capital, Manila. Kate McGeown reports.
It may not look much, but Scarborough Shoal is rapidly
becoming a prime piece of real estate. These little rocks, and
more importantly the rights to possible oil deposits around them,
are claimed by both the Philippines and China. It is pretty easy to see
which side this visiting journalist is from. Ships from both sides are
locked in a stand off in the area, Hundreds of Filipinos gathered
outside the Chinese embassy in Manila today to protest against

In Norway, it has been a particularly difficult morning for
the families of those killed on the island of Utoeya last year. The

his victims. At one point, the brother of one of those who died

Rosenberg has been following events, and you were in court when this
happened. Tell us more about it. has been a dramatic morning.
Coroners continue to deliver their reports about the victims using a
dummy to show where the bullets had hit. After every forensic report, a
personal message from the family of that victim was read out in court
about what kind of person he or she had been, about their interests,
their dreams, and you could feel the emotion rising like a pressure
cooker. There were people wiping away tears. Suddenly, one man stood
up and shout that Breivik, you are a killer, go to hell, you killed my
brother. He threw a shoe at Breivik. It missed, but there was
spontaneous applause from the public gallery. The man was helped
out of court and is now being comforted. The trial was
temporarily interrupted but has now resumed, with more graphic
testimonies from survivors. Yes, we have heard from more survivors of
the attack on the Utoeya Island. One witness described Breivik as
being totally focused on his killing, another described a
chaotic escape in a rowing boat with Breivik shooting at the boat.
Steve Rosenberg, thank you very much.
Security officials in London have refused to comment on reports from
the United States that an undercover agent who foiled a bomb
plot in Yemen was British. The bomb was to have been smuggled onto a
plane hidden in underwear. An investigation is under way into how
the details were leaked. Security correspondent Gordon Corera is here.
How much concern is there about the fact that it was late? There will
be concern, but they are being careful not to expose it to openly
because they do not want to comment at all on the plot, they do not
want to confirm that the agent was British, although we understand
that was the case. Because they do not want to confirm that he was
British, they do not want to be seen to complain about the leaks,
but there will be an happiness that the amount of information that has
come out of Washington. The view is that those kind of leeks make it
harder to recruit people to be undercover agents in the future. If
they think their identity will not be protected, they may not want to
do it, and if they see this kind of leaks, it may put the Mark.
Washington has said they will conduct an inquiry, that was
launched a couple of days ago when the first reports emerged about his
agent operating under cover in Al  Qaeda in Yemen.

The first consignment of steel manufacture that the SSI plant on
Teesside has been loaded onto ships destined for South East Asia today.
The blast furnace at the former Corus plant was relaid last month.
Many of the workers who lost their jobs when the site was mothballed
have now been re employed, as Alison Freeman reports.
It was the moment many feared they would never say, the relating of
the Corus blast furnace two years after it was mothballed. With it
came the return of steelmaking to Teesside. Thousands of jobs and
hope for young people in an area with one of the highest
unemployment rates in the country. Of course, it is good for jobs
coming to the area, it cannot be anything else but. We need that

look to the future. It will eventually have a positive effect.

survived another day to forecast a break from the rain to start the

has a sting in the tail across northern areas as it turns wet and
bright blue starts today, but chilly. Some cloud may threaten the
odd shower, but the vast majority will stay dry. These temperatures
are still not up to much for the time of year, but get some of that
