  That is incredible!
'My name is Dr Rhys Jones

'I'm licensed to handle some of the country's
'rarest and most dangerous animals.'
This is Catalina the cat snake, and yes, she's venomous.

I feel like I want to touch it.
'Coming up in this episode  
'It's Tearaway Terrapins   1 Welsh Wildlife Workers   0.'
Unfortunately, this is their environment, not ours.
There's an unexpected house guest in Newport.
'I'm called in to help a badly bullied bosc.'
He's been through a lot.
Wales is under attack!
There are over 60 invasive alien animal and plant species in Wales.
Through my work with the Welsh police forces
and Countryside Council for Wales.
It's a small female.
..I'm on the front line, attempting to beat back those invasive hoards.
Whoa! Look at the size of that one!
It's a constant war being fought in our villages, towns and cities.
Central Cardiff on a busy weekday afternoon.
I've been called by police to attend an alien wildlife emergency.
We've got a call out for a massive python
stuck underneath a large set of plumbing.
My partner in wildlife crime is PC Mark Goulding of South Wales Police.
Together, we investigate.
It seems this very frightened lady,
who has been in the UK less than 24 hours and is pregnant,
has photographed what appears to be a boa constrictor in her kitchen.
Don't you worry. I will make sure everything is fine. Don't panic.
These animals have incredible crushing capacity.
Very, very dangerous.
If it's slightly upset, we're going to have fun.
Oh, I can smell there's a boa in here.
If you just stay there.
We've got it.
It isn't a boa, you know. I'm pretty sure it's a royal python.
Keep that door shut just one second.
Lever out.
I think, actually...
No, we've got nothing to worry about, this is dead.
It's jammed in. This is very sad.
That's why we've got this stink. It's a dead animal.
Thank you. In relation to the snake, it's possibly a royal python.
Sad news is, it's dead.
This is obviously somebody's pet that's got out.
People are never really wise to just how easily
these animals can escape from their cages.
The poor thing has got out and this is the result.
Finding a dead snake is rare, thankfully.
Finding a live, non native reptile on the loose in Wales
is surprisingly common.
I receive over 100 emergency call outs a year
and the vast majority can be put into two categories.
Either the reptiles have been insecurely housed and escaped,
or they've become too big and aggressive
for their owners to handle and have been deliberately dumped.
I share my home with 14 friends, all of them reptiles,
all of them alien to Wales and all rescued by me.
This is Bogart, a lovely rat snake that was was dumped
on the top of Caerphilly Mountain.
He's completely harmless, unless you're a rat or mouse.
In the past I've recovered boas, pythons, even venomous snakes
that constitute a threat to our native wildlife and could be harmful to us.
The is Negenie, a beautiful Burmese python.
I recovered him from a car park in the Welsh Valleys.
He got too big and aggressive for his owners.
I'm sure when they bought him at about two foot long,
he was cute and cuddly, but at 15 foot, that's a different matter.
A reptile of this size needs specialist handling.
I don't keep Negenie and his 13 mates at home because I want to.
I think they're beautiful but they take up all of my spare time,
all of money, and their toilet and eating habits
leave a lot to be desired when you've got guests.
They live with me because they've got nowhere else to go.
Our zoos and wildlife parks are full to the brim with reptiles
and there are few professional handlers able to handle them
in captivity.
For my reptiles, there were only two choices.
Either I rescued them or they were put to sleep.
Surprisingly, not everybody loves snakes as much as I do.
In fact, some people are downright terrified of them.
Luckily, I'm happy to help them get over that.
Meet Terri and Joy.
  Hello, ladies.
  Hi, Rhys.
They are both self confessed ophidiophobics.
Ophidiophobia is the fear of snakes.
  What is it about snakes you find..?
  I don't know.
I've always been scared of them.
I just feel sick when I look at them.
I don't want to touch them.
Everything you see about snakes is on TV shows
when they're jumping and biting or swallowing something whole.
I don't like...
Most phobias are caused by a fear of the unknown and the unpredictable.
In this pillowcase is Ozzy, a seven foot Australian carpet python
I rescued nine years ago.
By slowly familiarising them with Ozzy,
I'm going to show Terri and Joy that snakes are very predictable
and that they have nothing to fear.
I'm going to sit here with the bag, nothing else if going to happen.
I'm just sat here, nothing's happened to me, look. Nothing.
I'm going to undo this knot now.
I'm quite far away.
You both look relatively comfortable that I'm this far away from you. OK?
  Yes.
Oh, God!
() Oh, my God!
  I haven't seen one like that.
  Are you guys OK?
I want to see its face.
Can you see that line there?
How would you feel if I was to move just up to there?
I won't sit on the chair, I'll stand behind it.
  Erm...
  OK. Yeah, let's just do this.
Just do it.
That makes me feel nervous. I can't look.
I think you're doing fantastically well.
I feel like I want to touch it but I don't.
Your mind is now saying, "This isn't what I thought it would be like."
Now you're thinking, "I've got this far, I want to get closer.
"I'm very nervous but I want to get closer to this animal."
This is a fear you don't want.
I just want you to come back to reality with a bump
and you're sat at a table with me holding a seven foot python.
  I didn't think I'd do it.
  How well are you doing?
  Extremely well.
  That's absolutely right. You should be proud.
Why don't you reach out and do it?
You want to do it. Go on, Terri.
In your own time. There's no rush.
You know you're going to do it because you want to.
  I felt like I had it.
  Great.
Oh, God, I'm going to touch it. I can't do it!
  OK, go.
  Yes, well done.
Terri, everything is good. Go on, do it.
Absolutely amazing!
  Terri, absolutely...
  Oh!
  It's not as bad as you thought.
  No.
But you've done absolutely amazingly.
Taken giant steps, you really have. Well done, guys.
Thank you, Rhys.
I feel good.
Still not a hundred percent, you know, because of the face.
I wouldn't mind getting to know it a bit more.
I was holding Terri's hand so hard, I must have squeezed it off.
I don't know, I'm better now I've seen a snake up close.
So, all in all, I guess it's been good and I do feel better about it.
The chances of you accidentally coming across
a non native snake species in Wales are slim.
What's far more probable is an encounter with a vicious alien
lurking in our waters.
Roath Park, Cardiff.
Wildlife crime officer PC Mark Goulding and I
have been called out by park's rangers to investigate
the illegal dumping of alien species into the lake.
Terrapins of the Teenage Mutant Ninja variety.
When the cartoon was at its height during the 1990s,
thousands of terrapins were imported from South America and sold as pets.
As soon as people began to realise these cute little terrapins
grow into aggressive adults the size of dinner plates
with a bite that can take your finger off,
they began dumping them into streams, rivers and lakes
leaving park managers like Gareth Stamp to deal with the consequences.
Somewhere in that lake, there are terrapins.
We don't really know how many.
The likelihood is they could be having an effect
on the rest of the wildlife on this lake.
We don't know really what.
I assume that some of these guys are really, really big.
Surely they're attacking chicks and protected species here?
They've got to be taking resources from somewhere, they are surviving.
Some of the ones I've seen are as long as my arm.
Very, very large terrapins.
The likelihood is they are probably taking chicks, young birds.
  They're a problem, then?
  Most definitely.
Unfortunately this hasn't stopped people releasing terrapins into the wild.
But the trouble for PC Goulding and me
is once they're out there, they're a nightmare to capture!
Here we are, lovely sunny day.
How are we going to capture this terrapin when we get there?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Hopefully, it's going to be on an island.
If it is on an island, that'll be great.
If it's not, we're going to get wet.
Stealth is the watchword, vigilance, subtlety and surprise.
That's what's going to bag us those pesky terrapins.
We drift silently towards the island.
Eagle eyed.
Come on, where are you?
Patience, Mark, patience.
I thought I saw something.
  That broken log in front, it looks like an alligator.
  Yeah, yeah.
I tell you what, Mark, I'm hoping it's not an alligator!
  Yeah, cos there wouldn't be any terrapins!
  A wasted journey.
And then, the breakthrough.
I think a head has just popped up over there.
Oh, I've got you, I've got you, I've got you.
  That is...
  There it is, a terrapin.
There, there, there.
Got it? We got it, we got it.
And there he was, head poking out of the water
like a little Loch Ness monster.
And then...
..he was gone.
This was proving harder then we thought.
We did get really close, literally that far away from one terrapin.
Unfortunately, this is their environment, not ours!
Time for Plan B.
Mark climbs a tree for a crow's nest view
using his polarizing sunglasses to see to the bottom of the lake.
As soon as that terrapin breaks for air, he'll give me he nod
and I'll pounce. Brilliant.
Trouble is, they can hold their breath for up to 20 minutes.
When it does surface, we'll be ready.
I can feel the net closing in, quite literally.
It's always important when you're looking for terrapins
  that you know who the police officer is!
  Absolutely.
Time to beat a dignified retreat.
  How do we sum up today?
  Failure.
But just as we're leaving to return another day,
a member of the public spots a terrapin in the lake salmon steps.
Mark and I wade in to investigate.
But it's not good news, I'm afraid.
There we have it, a dead terrapin. What do you make of that?
Well, you've got a number of offences here.
Not only have you got a non native species
introduced into a system where it doesn't belong,
but this is an animal welfare issue as well.
Someone is responsible for the damage and suffering of this creature.
They need to know it is arrestable and it is a prison sentence.
This is the result of somebody throwing away
a perfectly healthy creature.
It's disgusting.
A sad and sobering end to a fun day.
But unfortunately it seems that reptiles and irresponsible owners
often go hand in hand, as my next call out illustrates.
Most of the time, I enjoy my job, and there's other times when the actions of others horrify me.
I've brought this lizard to meet reptile vet Mark Evans
because, quite frankly, its condition is terrible.
What have you got for me today?
I'm furious about this, actually. It's a bosc monitor.
It's been brought to me by a very reputable handler.
He's not going to reveal where this animal came from
but the animal's been abused, I'll warn you now.
Obviously, it's been put in with a bigger bosc monitor and it's been bullied.
It's a little male.
It's had every digit ripped off apart from one. Bitten off.
It's terrified of people. It's so nervous.
  I'm going to gently get him out.
  He must be terrified of everything.
He's scared of his own shadow at the moment. He's absolutely terrified.
I'm going to keep an eye on his tail.
Everything head end is fine. No signs of wounds around the head.
Not that I've been able to identify but if you have a look at its feet.
It's not just the digits, you can see there's part of the foot,
especially the rear feet, it's disgraceful.
  This happened quite a while ago.
  Yeah, this is healing up now, yeah.
  The good thing is there's no signs of active infection in any of these nails now.
  Brilliant.
Do you think there will be any long term difficulties in this animal being in this condition?
He's not going to be able to climb or scrabble properly
or even dig properly.
It's going to affect his long term quality of life, not through pain or infection,
but because he's going to lose some of his natural behaviours.
Digging, for boscs, is a natural behaviour. It's important.
Normally, we'd set up an earth sand pit for him to dig in.
I'm thinking of making that more sandy than I normally do so it's easier for him to dig in.
It'll be interesting to see whether he eats.
Thank you, Mark, especially for fitting me in at short notice.
Brilliant.
I'm very relieved that there's no sign of infection from those horrible bites.
I'm going to get back to the university and see if he'll feed.
You're a good boy, aren't you?
Good boy.
People don't often think about the rehabilitation of reptiles.
They know about the rehabilitation of cats and dogs.
These are intelligent animals.
When they're upset, they remember.
He's gone through a heck of a trauma.
Imagine losing all your toes and fingers.
This is not a quick fix.
This is not a rescue where I can pop in and everything is done.
He's going to need a lot of handling and he has to learn to trust people.
Seeing as he's been so mal treated, we could try him out with a slightly different diet.
A bit of a gourmet menu today.
In their native Africa, they have a wide and varied diet.
They'll eat rodents, chicks, eggs and half their diet is insects.
Fancy a meal worm?
Well, meal worms get the thumbs up.
You can see the tongue is forked. It can track its prey by sent.
It gets two different chemical signals, from left and right,
to follow the prey, so he can hunt it down more efficiently.
Looking for more?
How do you fancy locusts? What about these?
He's got it.
Just using the table to...
..re arrange the locust and make sure he can get it in his mouth.
That's it. Down it goes.
It looks like out gourmet menu has been much appreciated.
What I'm afraid of is that we probably won't be able to rehouse this lizard.
He's fit and healthy, he's feeding.
He'll be fine. He'll live a long and happy life.
But he's probably not that attractive to people.
I think he's a beautiful lizard.
He's got incredible character
and probably he'll serve out his days living with me.
He'll certainly get a lot of attention.
Mark and I have returned to Roath Park Lake to face our terrapin foe.
This time, we're kitted out.
We've got wetsuits,
big hats, Gareth the park ranger
and an even bigger net.
But as we approach the island in the middle of the lake, I fear our plan might have been rumbled.
The terrapins have sent out a posse to greet us.
And there are more of them, on logs and in the water.
And as we disembark onto the island, we spot another.
Time for action.
If you stay there and let him see you're there.
  I shall do my best.
  His head's popped down again.
Oh, the swine!
  This is turning into Mission Impossible.
  Unlucky.
But we aren't about to give up and it's not long before the next terrapin emerges.
  I'll get the boat.
  We come up with a two pronged attack.
Mark heads out to cut them off at the creek
whilst I wade through the dead branches and knee deep silt to sneak up in front.
A classic pincer movement.
And just as I'm about to make my move.
To be honest, in hindsight, the best method for catching these animals would be a throw net.
Wait for them to go out basking, throw a net over them and haul them in.
Dynamite. That's what we need.
We'll be back.
Still, there's no rest for me when it comes to the alien emergencies.
There I was looking forward to going home for tea,
and we've just had an emergency call out.
Small snake, black and white, your guess is as good as mine.
This is lady is petrified that there's not only this snake,
but there could be another one in the flat.
It could be a California Kingsnake, a pet that somebody's let loose,
or, possibly, a grass snake.
We've no idea how many snakes are in this house so I've got a couple of bags.
Let's see what this lady's dealing with.
Not really snake territory, so what you'd expect is, probably, a pet snake to have been released.
Hello. Hiya.
Oh, look what we've got!
  Is it poisonous?
  No. I'll tell you what this is...
  It's a corn snake.
  It is a corn snake.
  A pet.
  It's a pet, yeah.
It's not poisonous, not venomous at all.
Oh, it's very cold.
Can you see, have a look at its eyes,
can you see how they're rather milky and white?
Can you see how milky they are?
The reason they're like that, they secrete this milky fluid
behind the eyes and all the way down the body
and they'll shed the skin all the way down in one go.
  It's not poisonous?
  Not at all.
The priority now is to get this snake back to the house
to get some food, water and warmth.
Here he is. One lucky little fella.
Now, he's a youngster.
When they grow bigger, he'll probably grow up to four foot.
He's blatantly dehydrated. If I pinch him, the skin stays in place.
He has a lot of baggy, loose skin.
He has not eaten in months.
I am convinced he was hybernating in that lady's flat.
She turned all the heating on, out he came.
He thought it was springtime.
What we need to do is get some water in him and also see if he'll feed.
Shouldn't really hand feed him like this
but I'm going to see if he'll gently take one of the pinkys.
A snake that size wouldn't be able to eat a fully grown mouse,
but they will take these baby mice.
I'm hoping, today, that our little friend might take one or two down.
There we go. He's taken that straight away. Look at that.
He was really hungry.
There we go.
That's fantastic. If he's eaten now, he will survive.
He'll be absolutely fine.
You can just make out his breathing.
He's got a breathing tube at the end of his mouth.
He's breathing while he's swallowing.
It's quite a large meal for him.
Just make sure he's not choking.
You or I, if we were swallowing a meal like that, we'd choke.
Our windpipe is down here.
But his windpipe, right at the front of his mouth.
He's really enjoying that. So would I if I hadn't eaten for six months!
That's the pinky that he's just eaten.
That's one happy little snake.
He's had something to eat.
I'm going to leave him with a bowl of water to digest this meal.
Somewhere warm and dark and, above all, safe.
Back at Roath Park Lake, Park Ranger Gareth Stamp and I
try to deal with the terrapins one last time.
What we need... Oh!
But it's like Groundhog Day on water.
The nearest we get to a terrapin is this. This is the ultimate...
You're not going to believe...
I am not making this up. It's Leonardo!
I've got a Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtle here. It's Leonardo.
But really, the joke is no longer funny, it's just maddening.
The frustrating thing is, it took somebody ten seconds to throw that in.
It's taken us four days to try and capture one.
This is a nightmare.
We're trying to tip toe around birds on nests.
We can't get anywhere near them in this environment.
Unfortunately, this will remain a problem
until we can find a way to trap these terrapins without the risk of harming our native wildlife.
Meanwhile, these aliens continue to do damage in our waters.
But there's better news for our toeless monitor lizard.
He's made a complete recovery and now lives happily at home with me.
I've renamed him Sobeck and there's nothing he likes better than watching television.
Wildlife, of course.
