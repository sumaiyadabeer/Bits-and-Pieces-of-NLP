The true cost of alcohol abuse. A new report says the price is
billions higher than previously thought. But does the report
actually say what the government claims it says? And why can't the
SNP convince the opposition parties to back minimum pricing? And the
First Minister visits Scottish MPs at Westminster. The Scottish Office
isn't really necessary, he told them. And Tony Blair broke the
rules when he included Al Megrahi in the prisoner transfer memorandum
indicates that alcohol abuse causes even more damage to Scotland's
health and wealth than had previously been measured. The
Scotland's opposition parties to support the government's plans for
minimum pricing. In the weeks since Scottish Labour decided to oppose
minimum pricing, a House of Commons committee has indicated support for
the idea, and England's Chief Medical Officer has voiced his
support for the medical consensus. Today's Analysis was commissioned
misuse is costing every adult in Scotland £900 a year. But the
researchers freely admit many of their figures are not precise. More
controversially, a large part of the cost comes from putting a money
value on grief and family loss, so  called human cost. Whatever the
validity of that, it is not what most people would normally think of
as a cost to the taxpayer. It also makes the study difficult to
compare with others which have tried to assess the cost of alcohol
always supported minimum pricing. This is a very difficult problem to
tackle. I think people who are drinking hazardously and Tom Foley
may not be able to make the decision for themselves and it may
a lack of change in their pocket. The UK Government's Chief Medical
Officer, Liam Donaldson, has made it clear he favours minimum pricing
and will continue to campaign for it. Last month, Iain Gray in
Scottish Labour decided to oppose the SNP Government's decision for
minimum pricing. They joined the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats,
thereby ensuring the consensus against the SNP's Al Gore Bill.
Last Friday, the health committee recommended the UK government
should adopt a minimum pricing strategy. In Scotland, the debate
remains politically life. I'm joined now by Labour health
spokesman Dr Richard Simpson MSP, who's in Edinburgh, and here in
Glasgow by the SNP's Michael Matheson MSP, who's on the Health
Committee. What do you make of this report
today, Michael Matheson? I think it is a much more comprehensive report
than previously. It illustrates in quite a bit of detail the range of
areas within society that are affected by it, whether it be
productivity, Health, Social Care and also the personal impact that
it can have on individual lives. And the human cost that goes with
that. It is much more comprehensive. To be perfectly frank, the figures
are quite staggering. It now appears as though we have been
underestimating the financial costs to society and the social cost.
There is an issue here. What the report does is, it tries to monitor
AIS grief, the loss that families feel because someone has died early.
To be fair to the authors of the report, they talk about the social
costs of our Gulbis. But this is not a cost to the tax payer in any
meaningful sense. I think you have to recognise this study is looking
up the cost of illness. Scottish government press release
says alcohol misuse could be costing Scottish taxpayers around
£6 billion a year. That isn't what this report is about. I don't agree
with that. If you more Mathias... They have said, let's try to put a
value on the loss to other people of someone dying young, grief,
family loss and all the rest of it. What they have done is come up with
the cost of a life each year and they have taken expected in
mortality rates    mortality rates and work backwards from there. That
may or may not be a valid exercise. But when people read that this is a
cost to the taxpayers, they think someone taxpayers are paying for
this and they are not. In some ways they are paying for it. The
methodology which has been used by the researchers is an approach
which has been used by other studies. I am not arguing with the
approach. I am arguing with the way the Scottish government is using it.
If you die prematurely as a result of alcohol misuse, there may be in
need for the state to provide financial support to the family.
That is not what the report is... The other point about this is that
paragraph 4 of the Scottish government press releases, or even
the lowest figure in the range is substantially higher than the
previous estimates. The researchers themselves say that you cannot
compare this study with other studies partly because they are
measuring things they have not measured before so of course the
figures are going to be different. I do recognise that. You always
have to have a level of caution when you are comparing studies with
one another. I know there are issues with alcohol. But you have a
situation where the public don't trust politicians. Is this not a
blatant case of the Scottish government using statistics? It is
looking at the whole cost to I think the points you are making
are absolutely right. Nobody denies there is a problem with alcohol in
Scotland. This is a new area of research, and as the authors of
this report clearly make the point, the figures they are based on our
hugely variable and very difficult to quantify. Can I give one
example? On ambulance costs, the range of ambulance journeys done in
their study, admit that it ranges from 6000 to 204,000 in terms of
being quantified. That is the sort of problem they have in this area
of research. It is difficult to quantify and that is in an area
where we know quite a lot. The human costs, which is one third of
the 1.4 £5 billion if you take the top end figure. 1 billion if you
take the lower end. Estimating human and social costs is not a
cost to the taxpayer. We have a problem, but it is typical of the
Government, they are calling something evidence when it is
actually not evidence. What about the other side of this? There is
the way the Government are using this, but if we take what the
researchers say, it does look like this is a pretty big problem. What
would it take to convince you to agree with Michael Matheson's
support for minimum pricing? answer is not minimum pricing. If
you want to talk about minimum pricing, we can do so. I can defend
the decision, which I advocated in our party, as someone who has been
a consultant in addictions. The medical fraternity are talking
about this as evidence. The Sheffield University's study and
literature of you says, there is only one research product talking
about minimum pricing in the world, and that is an Aboriginal community
in Australia. That is the only piece of evidence there is. The
rest is a mathematical, theoretical studies. Wouldn't the sensible
approach to this, from the SNP's point of view, giving you both
agree this is a problem, find some sort of compromise? There a two key
factors that drive Alcohol Concern Sion and that his availability and
price. Availability has been tackled through the recently
introduced licensing legislation. We cannot deal with this issue
effectively if we do not tackle the problem of very cheap alcohol being
sold in Scottish society. I am staggered Richard Simpson does not
think minimum pricing does not have a part to play in this. There is
overwhelming evidence we need to deal with this issue. We will have
to leave that other for the moment. Another Parliamentary story,
Scotland's First Minister and some of his team were invited to give
evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee of Scotland
affairs. Inevitably, some time was devoted to the man convicted of the
Lockerbie bombing. David Porter watched the proceedings.
Her wintery conditions at Westminster, cold and a biting wind.
Just as the snow has virtually cleared, so perhaps signs of a
thought he between London and Edinburgh? Alex Salmond became the
First Minister to answer questions on Scottish MPs, appearing before
the Scottish Affairs Committee. The subject, does Holyrood and
Westminster worked together? This observation on another current
enquiry. I am delighted to be here. I doubt
it very much if this will excite as much interest as another evidence
session taking place in the precincts of Westminster. That, a
reference to the appearance of Alastair Campbell before the
Chilcot enquiry. What about relations with the current Prime
Minister? One thing that surprised many people, myself included, was
in the period of the recession nearly a year went by without you
having any dialogue at all with Gordon Brown. What is the reason
for that lack of dialogue? If we take the Prime Minister's
predecessor, the first Prime Minister I dealt with. He wouldn't
speak to me at all from the first day of the SNP Government. That was
nothing to do with me, I was happy to speak to the Prime Minister. But
the then Prime Minister was upset with the election results. I am
delighted to speak to the Prime Minister any time and would love to
do so on much more regular occasions. I accept he has many
demands, but the wish for communication from the Scottish
administration, and I suspect the Welsh and Irish administration is
very great. And soon, a sign of some long standing political
enemies. What is the personal relation between ministers Tween
yourself here? It might be better between some of the UK Government
and their ministers. From a political friend, a softer question.
Can I stay on the theme of structures in relationship building
and mention one operation in Whitehall, the Scotland office and
ask you, what added value you feel the Scotland offers brings to the
relationship field on what you see as the role of the Scotland office
down here now? I am on The Record a number of times, as I'd been some
other people are, that I think the role of the Scotland offers has
been overtaken by devolution. I think the better, if it is
departmental contact her of the Scottish Government and its
officials contact directly, the relevant department, I don't think
an intermediary is particularly helpful on many occasions. I think
that it would be more effective. That would be my basis. For many,
the key point of interest was this man, a Lockerbie bomb, Hezbollah.
And the decision to free him on compassionate grounds last year.
According to the Scottish minister, subsequent agreements on prisoner
transfers or was a done deal. have never wavered from our view on
this matter. The view was for a number of reasons, the prisoner
transfer agreement, negotiated through the memorandum of
understanding which was first signed in May 2007, was a mistake.
Ali al Megrahi would be included in a prisoner transfers. It cut across
the due process of Scottish law, because one of the provisions of
prisoner transfers was that legal proceedings would have to come to
an end. It was a mistake because it cut across what we believe was a
prior agreement with relatives and a US Government. It was not
appropriate that Abdelbaset Ali al  Megrahi was included in it. The man
who ordered the release explain why. Making my decision with regard to
Abdelbaset Ali al Megrahi, I followed rules and guidance and the
as a Government that there is a great deal of concern amongst many
about Lockerbie, the fact that there has only been one person
always said we will be open and happy to co operate with any
inquiry, anywhere that would have the appropriate jurisdiction.
from an official, details of the final briefings to the UK and
scenario of planning, at the point before Mr MacAskill reach his
decision on the prisoner transfer application and on the
compassionate release application, there was planning with the various
parties, but always on the basis that the decisions could go either
way. When was that scenario planning? It was a matter of days
before the decision. Perhaps 10 days before. He the freeing of the
Lockerbie bomber was of course a one off. Bringing its own stresses
and strains. The Scottish Government insists it wants more
regular and Dida contracts between Holyrood and Westminster.
