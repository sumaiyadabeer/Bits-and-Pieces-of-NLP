Good things may come in "freeze", but not much football did. Still,
we salute all the games that did, just about, survive the big chill
Pitch perfect, as freezing weather plays havoc with the weekend's
fixtures. Are artificial pitches the solution?
Falling faster than the temperature, play acting players, conning
referees. The Knowledge. This week   the game
within a game, as attacker and defender play cat and mouse. Miaow!
And all aboard at the only League Two game to go ahead this weekend,
as Plymouth harbour more comeback Hello, thanks for joining us. Not
the easiest weekend for football, with only six of our 17 teams
getting a game, but rest assured we've got all the action that did
survive. Plus, Graeme Murty and Leroy Rosenior in especially feisty
mood. Hello to you both. Hello. The first thing we're going to talk
about is the weather. With 17 games frozen off this weekend across the
Football League, there's a growing belief among many in the game that
the best solution to weekends like the last is artificial pitches.
Should we put it on plastic? Wycombe Wanderers are among those
leading the campaign to go artificial.
League team Widnes beat the weather this weekend, playing their first
competitive match on a brand new artificial surface. Tony Husband
reports on football's reluctance to join the fans of plastic.
controversial 1980s foray into Astroturf. Several teams or went
bounce. He completely missed judged that on this at less than familiar
surface. There were allegations that it game the home team too much
of an advantage. The experiment soon lapsed. What comes a
technology has moved the goalposts. Third generation science makes the
artificial service    surface picture perfect. The bounce is
realistic, the surface is forgiving and it can bring financial benefits.
When people particularly in the lower leagues look for
opportunities for income revenue, they need closer community
relationships and a consistent playing surface. If plastic did
exist, how much more revenue and Saturday afternoon entertainment
would become a reality this weekend?    would have become a
reality? Snow we pictures. First of all, how
different was it? It was totally different. It was horrendous and we
had a massive advantage at QPR. You had burns all over your legs. I am
shocked many players have long term injuries. I have had 12 operations
on my knees. We certainly do not want pictures like that. Graeme,
you are used to working on third generation pictures? It is better,
more forgiving. You can turn, cut, the bounce is very good. I am not
sure I would want to be on it all the time but I understand the
argument in terms of revenue generation. We are talking about a
consistent playing surface. None of the games in the Premier League
were called off due to bad weather this weekend. It is a good idea for
some people but we do not think it is fair unless everyone has it.
Shouldn't you have the choice? At the moment the FA say you cannot
have it. There was a meeting in November in which they debated the
issue and there is a lot of talk it will be brought up next week when
maybe there will be a vote about whether clubs should be allowed to
go ahead. If you have an artificial pitch, you will see the same sort
of thing week in week out. We do not want the game to be false.
like the variable? I like that some pictures are slow and sometimes it
is white and all of the variables you get with different sorts of
weather. If you put messy on the pit, he would still be the best
player in the world. We are trying to make an enjoyable professional
game that is sustainable. What about the games that do not go
ahead at all? Swindon lost Tibetan and maybe they are going to look at
this depending on what happens next week. I would like every team to
have underfloor heating. The FA could put money aside to get that.
There is still the problem of getting to the game which you
cannot do a lot about. There is the argument about revenue but I think
it is a shrine. Trouble bridge is a shrine. You should not have Sunday
teams playing week in week out. It is a professional game.
Economically, there is a massive advantage of being able to use your
pitch throughout the week. understand that argument but my
point is, I do not think they are good enough yet. Not even the 4th
generation ones? Not yet, not for me anyway. You can continue the
debate if you have a view on Twitter. In the meantime, here is
what is coming up. We have got all the action from the weekend, all
six games. We have players who do not play fair and why it Murts is a
big girl's blouse. And we have The Knowledge. TV gold.
Right now, a little less conversation and more action with
our League Two round up. Here is a list of the weekend's games.
Plymouth against Southend. Do not forget the only game in
League Two. After going behind within a minute, Plymouth
supporters would have wished they have not bothered. The second after
poor defending as well players in a sometimes like buses, you get one
and another one comes along Plymouth Argyle looking at an
allegation that they sell them player was racially abused during
the match. The clubs say they are conducting a thorough investigation
into the complaints. Meantime, they came back from the gates of hell
there. They did not play well. When you are not playing well, that is
when you find out about their spirit and whether they have desire
and hard to get back into the game. They did. We knew it was going to
be a tough game. We made it tough on ourselves being 2 0 down. It
shows the character we have to come back so late on. We have got spirit.
You find a lot out about people when things are not going well. It
shows that the lads are fighting to the death whatever happens. Carl
Fletcher there. Still one. From safety at the bottom of League Two.
Three games from the championship starting with Bristol City against
Leeds. Commentary from Brendan James Wilson is the last man. The
referee has a decision to make... James Wilson is being called over
by the referee. He gets a straight red card. Ross McCormack races
plena. The referee has sent him off.    Ross McCormack was racing clean.
This could be a decision for the referee year. Bristol City could be
reduced to nine men. He has fouled is a card coming as well here. What
colour will it be? A yellow card for Daniel Fox. David Murphy...
That was close. That was Birmingham's first real chance of a
long time. The keeper had to watch this. They are very good a save
from the Southampton's number one. Daniel Fox looking for Rickie
Lambert. Billy Sharp... He blocked a wave. Chris Burke, he has had a
strong game. He is now going to go outside of Daniel Fox. He will get
a free kick. Daniel Fox comes across here. He did not win the
might have been a touch light and the assistant on the side is waving
in trouble here. The referee again reaches for his pocket. And
Brighton I a man down as well.    I Buckley. He gets his 7th this
season and was created by the centre. He has had plenty of
injuries since starting for men. That is how it leaves the
NPower Championship. Brighton have up to 10th and Bristol City six
Disappointment for Saints against Birmingham, showed that game have
been played? Not for me, I don't think so. I think he should have
been. Nothing wrong with it. Why do you think it should not have been
played? Looking at the safety of the players, it was not conducive.
Leroy is thinking old school. have seen terrible pitches but they
should have played with a red ball but just get on with it, it could
have been a good game. Sometimes it isn't, that is what happens.
Sometimes you get dubious decision from the referee.
Now, Extra Time. Throughout the season we'll be taking one of the
game's big issues, sticking 90 seconds on the clock, and letting
Leroy Graham and myself go at it. Today, tumbling, taking a dive,
simulation, players playing up and getting fellow pros sent off. It's
a debate that's been heightened this weekend by Stoke manager Tony
Pulis, well known to several clubs here in the region, who's demanded
that the players' union, the PFA, get involved by coming down heavily
on offenders. On our patch, did a Bristol City
player get his marching orders because of Leeds play acting? Look
at Leeds forward Ross McCormack. He's fouled, yes   now watch him.
Running to the ref to plead with him to get City's player red carded.
Or Southampton's Daniel Fox at Birmingham. The first of his two
yellows for this tackle. You'd think Chris Burke's ankle might
feel a bit sore, but no. He's got a headache too.
What's to be done? There's 90 seconds for Leroy Graham and myself
to find the answer. See who YOU agree with and let us know on
Facebook and Twitter. Graeme will probably be keeping score. I'm
starting. From the referee's perspective, and I will say...
Starting now! I will say stop giving the players the benefit of
the doubt because they will only abuse the trust and start reviewing
all video evidence whether you have seen it or not. Assimilation, look
back at it afterwards and if anybody is doing this, winning
penalties is one thing. You can never do that with simulation.
you want to review it, it will be simple because you can't tell if a
player is simulating. Sometimes it is obvious but sometimes it is not.
If my players get touched, I want my players to go down. I may lose
my job and my mortgage if we do not get the three points. We have to be
professional and do what we can to gain advantage over the team. My
manager is telling me to do it and we might not like it but we are not
here to make your job easy, we are here to win. It is the referee's
job to make sure that you are not wrecking the spectacle and the game
and the Careers of your fellow professionals. It is the decision
at the time. It could be the difference between winning and
losing. If it benefits us, we would not be bothered. It is not our job
to make it an edifying spectacle. And if we win, the fans go home
happy as well as the players. when you cheat...
I am so glad we had this chat. If there's anything you'd like us
to debate in Extra Time, you know Back to the action, with what
happened in League One starting yourself but you can when you
concede five goals. But Wycombe showed fantastic character to get
back in the game led by Gareth Ainsworth, here in the centre
circle and he leads the drive to get ahead of the ball on matches on
to what has to be not a great pass. You need quality and that is what
bad cross his, straight on the head unlucky not to score an own goal
here. There is no substitute for experience. We come out of the
relegation zone. And they are right behind Yeovil
now. Third consecutive away defeat for the Glovers. Yeovil got him for
but unfortunately it was eclipsed by this strike. The goalkeeper had
no chance with that one but we do feel a bit of luck with that save.
We come out of the bottom four. Just a point behind Exeter and
Yeovil. Gareth Ainsworth, extraordinary, still going strong
at 38. All the other? Were in of him on the show, a fantastic
catalyst for his team.    all the younger? He has a desire but then a
bit of desire, put it on a plate and get himself in the box so he is
fit and strong. He decides that he wants a go war himself. And his
celebrations have got a bit more genteel    he was a go for himself.
He has got a career as a rock musician. He does not need one, he
can keep going because he is an amazing athlete. I take my hat off
to him. A cult hero. Interesting to hear Murts's moral
ambivalence on the whole play  acting issue earlier on. No great
surprise given that this week's The Knowledge sees him descend into the
dark arts himself this week. Ethics? That's just an area east of
London to you, Murts, isn't it? resent that, I am a moral man. And
this week we will use Fletch to gain an advantage to make defenders
play where the centre forward wants to play. Let's intimidating style,
and I gave him tips to cope with such a big unit as Fletcher.
Give yourself a yard, push away, it gives you a chance to come want the
ball, and if you take a bad touch, it pushes the defender two yards,
come forward two yards. You have got a gap for any mistakes.
You are just holding him, and there it is, back in. All the sudden you
are hauled in the opposition. And He doesn't get everything his own
I will try to take myself a way out of his vision. We will play cat and
I am not comfortable, I like to know where the centre half is.
up in front and bang. And that takes away as he tries to dominate
physically. Yes, Fred. Well done. Perfect. Instead of that pinning
sensation, we talk about Freddie dictating the terms of engagement.
You could see me coming in and you took it off me. Nothing worse.
are not in the business of playing games that we lose. If we do, we do
Not easy, is it? The higher up you go, the smaller the margins become.
But I don't want the game played on Fletcher's terms. It makes his job
easier. But I need to field a defender because otherwise he could
smash through the back of me. That was allowed in my days. You give
him a note, give him a bit of space, and then you don't get injured.
Create uncertainty. Absolutely. Moving along, we may be in the
depths of midwinter but we could be a few weeks away only from a moment
of glory for one of our teams. Swindon Town, who are just one game
away from walking out at Wembley. They play Barnet at the County
Ground tomorrow night for a place in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy
final. So far their southern area final stands at 1 1. Aidan Flint
put Swindon ahead at Barnet. Only for Mark Hughes to equalise in the
second half. It may be a minor trophy, but it counts as a mark of
real progress for a new management team. And, of course, it's the
chance for the town of Swindon to enjoy a Wembley day out for the
The game was postponed like so many at the weekend but they still
kicked off on Saturday afternoon. A training session in interesting
conditions. Although the Mediterranean maestro, de Canio,

not so well nine is his work ethic. At first, I think it took the boys
by shock because they are used to getting Wednesdays and Sundays off.
But he expects people to be working hard and that is what it has been
like. It has witnessed many changes. The weather, the training
facilities and the backroom staff a far cry from the last out that he

warm weather. Yet Simon ferry is the only outfield player who
survives from what seems like another age. When, but fitting the
occasion, his team mates enjoyed It was a squad remained full of
banter, motivation and confidence. Thousands were there. The town of
Swindon had emptied for the day. And if it was not for Wembley's
infamous tape at the time, as Charlie Austin skied the ball,
perhaps the result would have been different as Millwall man at 1 0
promotion winners.    run out 1 0. Everybody was macro to play at
Wembley. Hopefully we can put it They have witnessed one relegation,
the part    the departure of two managers as well as players. And
they have got a new captain. Hopefully we can work up the steps
and pick up the trophy but we are not there yet, when two we need to

I bet Charlie often wishes they had an artificial pitch at Wembley.
What do you reckon? We have finished, put it to bed! They were,
you were the    you were involved in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy.
They will not trade that, the experience of play Wembley for
anything. That was the catalyst on the upward spiral for the club. I
think that will happen to Swindon. You can't beat it. And it just
breed confidence. As soon as you get the first trophy, you win
something and then you think you can do anything, invincible. That

Swindon. Any thoughts on power Canio there in the temperatures?

A couple of things before we go. One is the fantastic former

Bristol City this weekend. Tommy's just retired as community officer

he made when we featured him on Late Kick Off two years ago.

games that have been here at the club, working with the schoolkids

when I actually played the game. I know for a fact that it is what
they have in their lives. I am probably the straightest person
they meet. But once you have given those guidelines to them, I find
there's very few that will break them.
Leroy, it's been great to have you Thousands of young men have been
through the system with Tommy. And they will be better people and
footballers. That is what Tommy was about. And his work is continuing?
Yes, he has left in a good state and weather takes over has got a
good foundation. It has been great to have you back, mirror.    Leroy.
Some say Leroy's been serving a bit of a two week ban for rough play.
But, after all that play acting talk earlier, I'm wondering if it
was really merited. Have a look at this if you're not faint hearted.
Here's Murts and Leroy filming the titles for our match analysis,
