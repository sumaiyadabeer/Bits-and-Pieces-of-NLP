Come and play the game.
If you want to take the tower on you'll have to say his name.
It's Wiley, Wiley, Wiley Sneak.
It's off to the tower.
You'll be up against each other.
Sabotage the game but don't blow your cover.
I am waiting for you, pretties. There's only one will escape.
  And the rest...
You're Trapped.
Back! Something terrible has happened and I don't mean one of my snarts.
The snake from snake attack has escaped but you should be safe
cos it only eats fresh children.
Oh, no, I think it got my pet jub jub Fluffy.
Oh, that's all right I don't need a new jub jub.
I need a new snake.
KNOCKING AT DOOR Aha, the Unfortunates.
Up they come, this winch rope is older than me.
I should have had a new one last century.
This week's Unfortunates are from Watford.
There's William, he's a shepherd.
Shanice is addicted to aqua aerobics.
Ryan speaks fluent halibut.
That's Natasha, she collects duvet covers.
Ibrahim has a fear of butterflies.
And Samantha was lost in space for 20 years.
There's no turning back now. HE CACKLES
This is my watch tank.
This is where I gets to see everything that goes on in the tower.
Hundreds of years ago, bobbing craft began arriving.
Each one filled with Unfortunates
ready to take on The Voice and her tower.
Imprisoned at the top they work as a team
to pass the challenges and escape each floor.
But, one of them cannot be trusted.
On each floor a new saboteur is chosen.
You are the saboteur.
The Voice speaks to them, using the whisper clip,
and helps them to ensure their team fail each challenge.
Floor by floor, it's a battle against their friends
and only one will escape with the key of freedom
and the rest remain...trapped!
Floor six, Poisoned Harvest.
These berries might look guzzlesome but looks can be deceiving.
Welcome to the mystical wood where the trees are bursting with
juicy wheedle berries. To pass this challenge
the Unfortunates must collect all the berries
and put them in each other's baskets.
But, they must pick carefully because the purple berries are poisonous.
If two baskets are found to be contaminated
with poison berries, they will fail.
So, who is the one who can't be trusted?
It's time to pick the saboteur.
'Natasha do not react, you are the saboteur.
'It is your job to ensure your team fail this challenge.
'You can do this by making sure two baskets contain a poison berry
'at the end of two minutes.
'Be careful you don't want to be detected.
'Do not panic I will guide you through your whisper clip.'
Natasha's the bad apple this time, can she turn the challenge rotten?
Unfortunates, this is Poisoned Harvest.
To pass, you must collect all the good wheedle berries
without contaminating more than two baskets.
Let the challenge begin. Now!
'Natasha, everyone is watching their backs, but who is watching yours?
'Remember you must not get caught.
'OK, choose your first victim. Who will it be?
'It's Samantha, well done, I think you got away with that.
'Look around. What can you do to gain their trust?'
  Go, William.
  'Excellent, William must think you are a real team player.
'Keep this up and they'll not suspect a thing.'
60 seconds.
'Looks like you've fooled Ryan. Brilliant.
'OK, Natasha, it's time to choose your next victim.
'Ibrahim's back is turned.
'Nicely done, Natasha, you've contaminated two baskets.
'All you need to do now is collect wheedle berries.
'Just carry on helping the team.'
30 seconds.
'Why did you put a poisoned berry in Shanice's basket
'you've already contaminated two, do you want to be caught?
'OK, Natasha just keep helping your team and you'll not get caught.
'Ibrahim again, what are you doing?'
  Six, five, four...
  'Time is running out.'
  One...
Your time is up. You have failed, miserably.
Looks like the team have failed. But, has the saboteur been seen?
You must now vote for who you think the saboteur is.
William, who do you think the saboteur is?
I think the saboteur was Shanice
because I saw her putting a lot of poison berries in people's baskets.
Shanice who do you think the saboteur is?
I think the saboteur was Ryan cos he kept sneaking in with poison berries.
  Ryan?
  I think it was Shanice because she picked a poison berry
  and I saw her put one in her bag.
  Natasha?
I think the saboteur was Ryan
because he kept putting poison berries into Ibrahim's basket.
Ibrahim?
I think the saboteur was Shanice
because I saw her put a poison berry in her own basket.
Samantha who do you think the saboteur is?
I think the saboteur was Ryan because I saw him
sneakily look behind and put a poison berry in people's baskets.
You have voted for Shanice and Ryan.
Oh, get the draw straws out.
Whoever draws the short straw will be trapped.
Shanice you've drawn the short straw.
Therefore you are the unlucky one.
I can now reveal the saboteur was in fact...
..Natasha.
Shanice, you will not be leaving this room.
The others are free to pass to the next floor.
Aagh, if she keeps this up, she could be going free.
Shanice, how do you feel about being trapped?
I feel quite sad but I've still got loads of berries to play with.
Poor, Unfortunate Shanice. You're trapped!
Ah, the short straw for Shanice.
Every floor we trap one more. No exceptions!
Floor five, Septic Sewers.
Ugh. Raw sewage my favourite smell but not for the Unfortunates,
it gets right up their nose.
Ahh, the Septic Sewers, to pass this challenge
the Unfortunates must plug up the toxic gas escaping from the drain.
It's causing a right old stink.
When the drain is complete, they'll be sucked back up the pipes.
Whilst waiting in the dark, someone will be sneaking about.
They must plug up the drain before the time runs out or they will fail.
It's time to pick the saboteur.
'Ibrahim do not react, you are the saboteur.
'It is your job to ensure your team fail this challenge.
'You can do this by making sure the drain
'is not complete at the end of two minutes.
'I will advise you when it is safe to leave your pipe
'and unplug the stinky gases.
'You will have five seconds to unplug the drain
'from when you first touch a plug.
'I will guide you through your whisper clip.'
Can Ibrahim do it?
Unfortunates, this is Septic Sewers.
To pass you must complete the drain by the end of two minutes.
Let the challenge begin, now!
'OK, Ibrahim look like you're helping your team. That's it.
'Right, quick, Ibrahim, out you come, quietly.
'Pull the plugs.
'That's it. Well done.
'But next time, spin the drain you don't want to frame yourself.
'Out, out. Hold it.
'OK, the coast is clear.
'That's it spin the drain,
'now it looks like someone else has pulled out the plugs.
'Quick, come out, you don't want the others to suspect you.'
There's one there, put it in quick.
60 seconds.
'Try and frame one of your team mates
'throw plugs in front of their tunnel. Yes!
'Keep spinning the holes towards Ryan and Natasha.
'Good work. You're doing brilliantly.
'Keep going. Keep framing your friends.
'Hopefully the others will suspect Ryan or Natasha.'
Come on, Natasha. Why is it always coming to my side?
'Brilliant the whole team is turning against Natasha.
'This could be your last chance,
'really go for it, spin it around.'
Seven, six, five.
Quick out of your tunnel, you don't want to be the last one out.
One.
Your time is up, you have failed, miserably.
Oh, nicely done, but has the saboteur been spotted?
You must now vote for who you think the saboteur is.
William, who do you think the saboteur is?
I think the saboteur was Natasha, because there was loads of plugs
next to her and she kept on turning the wheel on to my side.
Ryan who do you think the saboteur is?
I think it was Natasha because she had loads of plugs in front of her.
Natasha?
I think the saboteur was William because I kept hearing banging
coming from his side as he threw it over to my drain.
Ibrahim?
I think it was Natasha because all the holes were next to her
except the last one.
I think she got smarter at the end and threw it all the way round.
  Samantha?
  I think it was Natasha because she was slowing down
and not putting the plugs in right.
You have voted for Natasha.
I can now reveal the saboteur was in fact...
..Ibrahim.
Top tower technique. Successful sabotage and nobody spotted them.
Natasha you will not be leaving this room.
The others are free to pass to the next floor.
Natasha why do you think the others voted for you?
Because Ibrahim kept throwing the plugs in front of my drain.
Poor, Unfortunate Natasha. You're trapped!
Natasha, on one floor a successful saboteur, on the next trapped.
Floor four, Snake Attack.
GROWLING Later, Fluffy later.
Lucky for you I've got another snake.
Fluffy's developing a right taste for them.
A strange wall faces the Unfortunates.
One of them must make it safely from
one side to the other, choosing which holes to put their hands in.
They must choose wisely
because the wall is home to a hungry child eating python.
She's waiting in one of the holes for a little snack.
It's simple   if they get bitten three times they fail.
But, it's not just the snake who's going to be a slippery customer.
'William, do not react you are the saboteur.
'It is your job to ensure your team fail this challenge.
'I will tell you where the snake is.
'Use your powers of persuasion,
'but careful you don't want to be detected.
'I will guide you through your whisper clip.'
Agh, if William fools the team one of them could be hiss tory.
Unfortunates, this is Snake Attack.
To pass, you must avoid the child eating python.
Let the challenge begin, now!
'William, the snake is in the top hole.'
Not the middle one because it looks like there's been some...
'Ryan thinks it's in the top hole.
I think I'll go with Ryan. Try top.
'They are going for it.
'Excellent!'
  Told you!
  What hole now?
'The snake is in the top hole again,
'get one of the others to lead Samantha to the second bite.'
Try the top again because...
It can't be top again.
No. It can't be top again.
So, what one do you think?
Top.
Oh, no, is it top or bottom?
What do you think, William?
  Bottom.
  'Let them have it.'
Oh!
'This time it's the middle hole. Take the lead.'
Try the middle because we...
We've tried the bottom, the top Let's try the middle now.
  Let's go for middle now.
  'Excellent. They've all agreed.
'Here it comes.
'Good work, William, that's two down one to go.
'This time the snake is in the bottom hole.'
Now, this is a decision.
Ibrahim, you choose.
  Let's go for the bottom.
  'Yes!'
  No, top, top, top.
  'Ah!'
  Are you going to try the first?
The first one was top, yeah?
The second one was bottom.
Let's go back to the top.
'Now Ibrahim is really bossy don't let him take over.'
Yes!
  What one now? Can I choose this one?
  Yeah.
Last chance, William, they must choose the middle hole.
  I think the middle.
  Yeah, the middle.
  Middle.
Shall we try the middle? Try the middle.
We've tried them all, so go back to the middle again.
'Well done, William.'
Oh!
You have failed, miserably.
Oh, that all went rather well, or did it?
You must now vote for who you think the saboteur is.
William, who do you think the saboteur is?
I think the saboteur is Ryan because he kept on talking over everybody.
Ryan?
I think the saboteur was Ibrahim
cos every time William and I were agreeing, Ibrahim kept on denying.
  Ibrahim?
  I think the saboteur was Ryan
because whenever he said something,
William agreed with it, then I also agreed with it,
but he changed it in the end and got it wrong.
  Samantha?
  I think it was Ryan cos every hole I put my hand in
had the python in.
You have voted for Ryan.
I can now reveal the saboteur was in fact...
..William.
Oh!
Oh, oh, perfectly done.
Ryan you will not be leaving this room.
The others are free to pass to the next floor.
Ryan, how do you feel about being trapped?
I don't feel very comfortable because the snake
could come out of one of those holes and eat me at any second.
Poor, Unfortunate Ryan.
You're trapped.
So, Ryan's trapped, let's hope that snake stays in the wall.
Floor three, the One Eyed Watcher.
Roll up, roll up for the One Eyed Watcher.
He'll be keeping one eye on the Unfortunates,
and his other eye on the table.
To pass this challenge, the Unfortunates
must follow his eyeball and find it under the domed cups three times.
Get it wrong three times and they will fail.
There's only three, so who will it be?
It's time to pick, the saboteur.
'William, it's you again.
'It's your job to ensure your team fail this challenge.
'You can do this by making sure your team pick the wrong cup.
'I will tell you where the eye is each time.
'It's up to you how you use this information.
'I will guide you through your whisper clip.'
A meddler in their midst, can William convince them?
Unfortunates, this is the One Eyed Watcher.
To pass, you must find the eye three times.
Let the challenge begin, now.
'Right, William, the eye is under cup number two,
'they must not choose that one.'
  I think it's under number three.
  I think it's number three as well.
  I was going to say number three.
  'William, let them decide.
'Ah, excellent, that's one down, two to go.
'This time the eye is under cup number one.
'So, avoid it.
  'See if you can get them to change their minds.'
  I think the middle.
  I think number one.
  OK, try number one.
Yes.
'Don't panic, William, you still have time to turn this around.
'It's under cup number two this time.
'Agree with Ibrahim, it will look like it's his decision.'
Number one, please.
  Ohh, I can't believe it.
  'Good acting.
'I think you've got Samantha on side.
You only need to fool them one more time.
This time it's under cup number two.
  Number three.
  I thought three as well.
'They are doing your job for you.'
Tap it, William.
'Excellent work.'
Oh!
You have failed.
I think the saboteur did well good, but will it be enough?
You must now vote for who you think the saboteur is.
William, who do you think the saboteur is? And why.
I think the saboteur is Ibrahim
cos every time we went with his idea we got it wrong.
Ibrahim?
I think it was William because he always voted last
for some strange reason he agreed with us at the end.
Samantha?
I think it was Ibrahim
because he suggested the answer and we got it wrong.
You have voted for Ibrahim.
I can now reveal the saboteur was in fact...
..William.
A successful sabotage and they kept their identity secret
that's how to play the game.
Ibrahim, you will not be leaving this room.
The others are free to pass to the next floor.
Ibrahim, why do you think the others voted for you?
I was always the first one to answer.
Poor, Unfortunate Ibrahim.
You are trapped.
So, Ibrahim's trapped.
He should have kept his goggle spots on William.
Floor two, one way out and there can only be one winner.
It's the fight for freedom.
To win the key of freedom Unfortunates must answer questions
on their time in the tower.
It's simple   win and they'll escape, lose and they'll be trapped.
Ooh, I'm so excited I could lick a lamp post.
Unfortunates, this is your fight for freedom.
The Unfortunate with the most correct answers will be the winner.
You have 60 seconds to prove yourself.
Let the challenge begin, now.
William, who was trapped on the sixth floor?
  Shanice.
  Correct.
Samantha, what colour were the One Eyed Watcher's cups?
  Silver.
  Incorrect, gold.
William, what number was on the wall in Snake Attack?
  Four.
  Correct.
Samantha, what colour was the tent on the third floor?
  Purple.
  And?
  Pink.
  Incorrect. Purple and white.
William, what did you wear on your back in Poisoned Harvest?
A sack.
  Me.
  Correct.
William, how many plugs were in the drain in Septic Sewers?
  Six.
  Incorrect. 12.
Samantha, how many baskets were contaminated in Poisoned Harvest?
  Two.
  Incorrect, three.
William and Samantha, your time is up.
William you answered two questions correctly.
Samantha, you answered one question correctly.
William you are the winner.
Congratulations. Samantha, how do you feel about being trapped?
I'm just glad I got this far and I didn't think I'd get this far.
I didn't come to win I came to take part.
Poor, Unfortunate Samantha.
You're trapped!
William, you have won your freedom. Take the key
and leave the tower before I change my mind.
You can't trap me.
Oh, so, William escapes from the tower,
a bit like that snake escaping from the wall.
And, the worst thing is, as fast as I get new snakes
this jub jub seems to be eating them. LOUD BURPS
Anyway you'd best scootle,
I think Fluffy might still be hungry
and you wouldn't want to get Trapped!
