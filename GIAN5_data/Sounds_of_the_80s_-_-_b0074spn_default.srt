And I just can't get enough I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me And everything you said
I just can't get enough I just can't get enough
We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of
And I just can't get enough I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you I know we have to meet
I just can't get enough I just can't get enough
It's getting hotter It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of
I just can't get enough I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough...
When you're in love You know you're in love
No matter what you try to do
You might as well resign yourself
To what you're going through
If you're a hard man or if you're a child
It still might get to you
Don't kid yourself you've seen it all before
A million mouths have said that too
I've had my hard times in the past I've been a husband and a lover too
I've lain alone and cried at night Over what love made me do
But this is Phil talking
I want to tell you What I've found to be true
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action
I love your love action...
