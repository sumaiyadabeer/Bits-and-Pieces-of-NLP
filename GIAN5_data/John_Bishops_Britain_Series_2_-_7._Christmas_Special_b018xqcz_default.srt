Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's nice to see I'm not the only one
wearing my Christmas clothes in here today.
Welcome to the show.
This is a Christmas edition of John Bishop's Britain
and it's lovely to be back.
Every year, there's a Christmas special of every show.
You get the Wipeout Christmas special.
The Watchdog Christmas special.
The Embarrassing Bodies Christmas special.
David's got a cock that looks like a reindeer.
The way the show works is I've been all over Britain,
talking to people about Christmas and getting their views.
And these are some of the people I've been talking to.
Some of them, you'll recognise. Some of them, you won't. But if they're
at the end of your bed on Christmas Eve, you'd probably run a mile.
And this is a taster of what they had to say.
It's Christmas!
Shake it over a nice bit of stuff.
I love you, mwah!
  It doesn't get better than that.
  Urgh.
  Bah, humbug.
  Oh.
  Angry.
  All hell used to break loose.
  Smash up the Santa Clauses.
Merry Christmas, everybody!
We'll be hearing more from them later and, also,
there'll be the odd sketch or two to help us along the way.
Now, Christmas, as we know, is a very, very stressful time.
Mainly because what happens is,
you've got to buy presents for people.
When I was a kid, we didn't get the presents that kids get now.
I remember one Christmas, just getting an orange
and a magnifying glass.
That's all I got. I just looked at my dad and said, "What's that?"
An orange and a magnifying glass. I said, "That's not a present."
He said, "Just go like that, son, you've got a space hopper."
When I was a kid, one of the things
that we did every day at Christmas is we used to go to Mass.
And, obviously, there were some kids who got better presents than me.
And you could see them showing off.
Riding to Mass on their brand new bicycle,
showing off, and then walking home crying cos they'd never got a lock.
But the reality is, Christmas wouldn't be the same
if it wasn't for the presents.
I think the worst person in the family to buy for, for any man,
is the wife.
I think the hardest person to buy for is...me.
Men are difficult to buy for.
I mean, what do you buy for a chap for Christmas?
Oh, thank you, yes, another pair of socks. I really needed them.
I don't think you can disguise a present you don't like.
It's like, "Urgh, what's that?"
Ooh, no, not really me.
About four or five years ago, to my horror,
I discover that my Christmas present is a sackful of chickens
that had been given to a third world village.
Who wants a lot of old aftershave and soap on a rope?
It's not what I consider festive or appropriate.
Women don't want nasty red nylon
frilly knickers that you think are sexy.
  Have I ever, have I ever bought you anything like that?
  Sadly not.
No, obviously, someone else in your life has and scarred you.
(Might have done.)
Women are much easier to buy for. Much, much easier.
I soon learnt that you don't buy a wife any kitchen appliances.
Perfume, or jewellery, or gloves.
The look of disappointment on her face when she opened this blender.
It was just terrible.
And just by her eyes, you knew that I'd done wrong.
That is a typical man's thing, isn't it? "There you go, love.
"Go and blend something, eh?"
What's happened with us is our kids have changed as well.
Cos our kids aren't kids who want something for Christmas now.
We've got teenage kids, and everyone in here with teenage kids knows
they don't want presents when they're teenagers.
They want money.
When they say, "Don't get me presents, just give me money,"
that's really awkward. It's OK if you've only got one child.
If you've only got one child, it's not a problem.
But if you've got three, it's difficult.
Cos when you give them money...
they know how much you love them.
And you can't love them all the same.
So, you end up giving them money and they end up measuring
how much money they've got against the others.
Then one of them realises that...
he was a mistake.
Ah! I'm just laughing cos one of my lads is here and he's just gone...
And the other thing that's never changed, no matter what happens,
it never changes, you still have stocking fillers, don't you?
Every Christmas, you still have something at the end of the bed
and you fill the stocking.
It's tradition!
Our family's carried that tradition on.
My kids, ever since they were babies, have done the same thing.
Every Christmas, they wake up and at the end of the bed,
they get some fruit, some nuts,
the odd satsuma.
My lads walk downstairs every Christmas
with a satsuma in their hand and go, "What's that?"
I say, "That's a satsuma."
They go, "Well, there's a bowl of them over there."
Why do we give them satsumas?
Did baby Jesus have vitamin C deficiency, or what?
It's a pointless thing to give them.
And when I was a kid, as well, we couldn't afford nuts,
Christmas was the only day you got nuts.
That must have been an absolute nightmare
if you didn't know you had a nut allergy.
You're sat at home, playing your Scalextric,
thinking, "I want to treat myself."
And the biggest difference, as well, at Christmas, comes from seeing
the way men and women treat presents.
You know, women, they get a present,
my wife's particularly the same with this.
She'll get a present
and she will wrap it up like you're going to send that present
on a journey on the back of a yak, over a desert for three weeks.
She wraps it up and wraps it up and wraps it up
and wraps it up and then tapes.
And wraps it up and wraps it up and wraps it up.
Whereas a bloke, wrapping something up, basically means putting it
in a different bag than what you bought it in.
But we all know that there's only one person who brings you presents,
and that's Santa.
Father Christmas definitely exists.
I'm only 12 inside myself and Father Christmas still exists in my heart.
I used to lie in bed with my eyes tight closed
and I would hear someone coming in, and I just opened just a slit
and would see just a glimpse of red.
Father Christmas was really important to us kids. We used to love him.
And then I'd hear the crackle of all the presents, the paper crackling.
They were all put at the foot of my bed in a big pillowcase.
It was so exciting.
Get a grip. Santa ain't real, mate.
Doesn't exist.
And if he was, he's dead.
Angry that he wasn't real.
Father Christmas isn't real.
I was angry that I'd been lied to for so many years.
Obviously, it was a huge scandal
when you found out Father Christmas didn't exist.
I'll never forget the day when I was trying to figure out
how he was going to get into our flat.
Um, through the little electric heater that was in the lounge.
I developed a coping mechanism that I would inflict that horror
on other people.
"How's this going to work?"
And I was shattering their dreams.
And I was just like giving them a reality check.
I just think it's just ridiculous.
I'd rather know the truth.
Doesn't exist.
Santa Claus does exist! What are you talking about,
he doesn't exist? Of course he exists!
I've met him.
To be fair, there was a lot of drugs knocking around in the '70s.
Noddy probably did meet him.
And the other thing with Santa as well
is it removes everything that you normally do as a parent.
You would never normally say to your kids, "Listen, listen,
"there's a dark room there, there's a man you've never met before.
"Go and sit on his lap and ask him for something. Go on."
Cos that's what you do, you change everything. But it's tradition.
It's tradition.
And one of the traditions that keeps on going, in fact, even now,
even now that my kids are teenagers.
We still do, leaving a carrot out.
And brandy.
I mean, obviously, it's a long time since we left brandy out.
I mean, they must have been five or six when I actually told them
that Santa preferred Bacardi and Coke.
And maybe if you could leave the porn channel on,
he wouldn't mind some of that.
I was... When we were talking about doing this show,
I was speaking to a mate of mine about Christmas memories
and about keeping the magic alive and that point in your life
when you realise Santa isn't there.
And he said what he did, which was probably the cruellest thing
he's ever done in his life, but I thought was the funniest,
he said his little brother didn't know about Santa.
He was 12, he was a big lad, he knew. His little brother was seven.
He said on Christmas Day, his little brother come downstairs.
He said, "Has he been? Has he been?"
He said, "Yeah, he's been, he's been.
"But there's been a little bit of an accident."
He took him outside, he said he put a cherry tomato in the snow.
Tomato sauce around it.
He said, "He came,
"but the dog ate Rudolph."
That's just brilliant!
Poor kid cried for about four years, I think.
But one of things that everybody enjoys at Christmas, and one of the
things that is always going to be a Christmas tradition is the nativity.
Yeah, I was in the school nativity play and, of course,
because I was born on Christmas Day, I was Jesus.
I actually had quite a major role in the school nativity.
I was one of the shepherds.
I was shepherd number one.
It's always like shepherd number 14.
I was a very important second shepherd.
The pivotal shepherd.
Which included quite a substantial solo.
Shepherd number 14.
My mum was in the audience just...in floods of tears.
You're either one of the main parts or you're what I was.
A cow.
Once, I was a cow.
I was a cow.
I like to do things properly.
Even though I can't act. But I like to be a proper cow.
I hated being a cow.
And I really tried to get this moo out of myself.
And I farted.
I was the little, little Angel Gabriel, I was,
in a Christmas nativity.
I was Mary. And everyone else was like, "Woah, you're Mary."
And I'm like, "I think I'd rather be a sheep, actually."
The Virgin Mary, she, er, wet her knickers and her knickers
fell down, soaked with wee cos they couldn't contain the amount of wee.
She was very nervous.
The school production, um, of The Birth Of Jesus, this year,
was the best thing I've ever seen.
It was better than New Order at Reading in 1998.
The audience found it wonderful.
The reality is, the nativity play is something that's special.
I read something, this year, that the average expenditure
on an outfit for the nativity play was £150.
That is ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
When my kids were in nativity plays,
it wasn't that expensive for a tea towel.
That's all they'd want.
A tea towel, that's it, you're a shepherd. You're in, off you go.
But what happened, cos I had three kids quite close together,
I couldn't get to all the nativities.
So, the last one was having his nativity, I said, "I'm going to go.
"I'm definitely going to go to this nativity."
I went. And every parent knows that the nativity play's
a bit of a competition.
You want to know what part your son's going to play,
or your daughter's going to play.
It was a little bit awkward, I took my camcorder.
One of the teachers said,
"Oh, you can't just go in with your camcorder.
"You've got to ask the headmistress."
So, I went in to ask the headmistress.
There was me and three other blokes.
She said, "I can't decide.
"Society's changed, we've now got to ask the parents their permission,
"if they mind you videoing the nativity."
So, me and three other fellas had to come out...
This is the scariest thing I've ever done in my life.
..and stand there with camcorders,
in front of all of the parents,
while she says, "These gentlemen would like...
"..to film the nativity. Has anyone got any objections?"
I can't tell you how scary that was, cos I just thought
if one of mates is here now, they're going to go, "It's him!"
I was stood there thinking, "What are you looking at me for?
"It's the fella at the end sweating you want to worry about."
But what happened is we got the opportunity to go in
and watch it, and it was a lovely thing, a lovely thing.
But it was also the fact that I hadn't really asked
what part he was in. So I'd never considered what was going to happen.
I was just there, like every parent, looking forward to the occasion.
If you've been to the nativity, you know what happens.
Mary and Joseph come in first. He was none of them.
I didn't mind the fact that he wasn't one of them.
I didn't want him to be Mary, for obvious reasons.
I also, I didn't want him to be Joseph either.
I didn't want him to get used to the idea at a young age
of someone else knocking your bird off.
Then the three wise men came in.
I was videoing them, I counted them, three wise men. One, two, three.
I thought, "He's not one of them either."
I said to my missus, "He's not one of the three wise men.
"There's three of them, he's not one of them."
She said, "Well, he's not a wise man."
And then the shepherds came in.
Six shepherds.
He wasn't a shepherd.
I said, "He's not even a shepherd.
"There's no one else in it except Mary, Joseph, three kings,
"the shepherds. There's no one in it."
The shepherds came in,
six shepherds, three sheep.
What does that teach kids about shepherds?
Six shepherds, three sheep. I was looking.
He wasn't a sheep, he wasn't a sheep.
And then four tigers came in!
Four tigers! I think, "What are the tigers doing in Bethlehem?"
At the end of the tigers...
one...
donkey.
I just looked at that donkey and I went,
"That's the best donkey I've ever seen."
I said, "Go, donkey. Go, donkey."
But at the end, I went up to the teacher and I said,
"How come you had one donkey and four tigers?"
I said, "What are the tigers doing in Bethlehem?"
She said, "Oh, one of the mothers can do face painting."
The other thing that happens, and you've all done it,
looking at your hats, is the cracker.
That Christmas cracker moment.
They've stopped putting jokes in. Have you noticed that?
They've run out of jokes, so you might get one joke.
You might get one joke and then it'll have a fact, a Christmas fact.
That kills Christmas.
We were sat there last year, I read the Christmas fact.
I went, "Oh, this is interesting.
"More domestic violence takes place on Christmas Day...
"..than any other time of the year.
"Oh, right, well, that's good, isn't it?
"So, it's not just us, is it?"
Another tradition that took over this country
over recent years as well is German markets.
Particularly here, in the city of Manchester.
The city of Manchester really embraces Christmas.
Every year, for those people at home who don't know, the city council in Manchester
pay for a big 60 foot inflatable Santa Claus
to hang off the town hall.
Every year, there must be a council meeting where they sit
and they say, "Look, lads, you know, Christmas is coming up and,
"obviously, there's been a lot of cuts this year.
"We could invest some of this money into education,
"the health service, or helping the elderly.
"Or let's have a big Santa hanging off t'tower, eh?"
It's there every year.
And then what's come in, the last couple of years,
is this idea of German markets.
And I don't know where they've come from, German markets.
I don't know whether Churchill said to the Germans
at the end of the Second World War, "Look, lads, let's call it a day
"and then in 60 years' time, you can come over at Christmas."
You know? I don't know what's going on.
Cos I don't know if you've been to a German market.
There's no Germans there.
There's just some fella from Bolton trying to sell you sausages.
I think if there's German markets, and there's been one coming
to Manchester now for at least ten years, cos I've been to it a lot.
I think if there's a German market in Manchester,
that must mean there's a Manc market in Germany.
I absolutely love the idea of Germans buying
ten pairs of toweling socks and some tea towel.
Or some Manc in a tracky going, "Ah, lad. Happy Christmas."
And German markets aren't the only thing that arrive at Christmas.
One thing that you don't get at any other time of the year
is specific music.
And everyone knows it wouldn't be the same without Christmas music.
I can't stand the classical,
"Oh, everyone's happy at Christmas" type of songs.
I love any Christmas record. I'm a big Christmas fan.
I don't really play Christmas records at Christmas.
I think it's quite cheesy.
Christmas album on, Christmas morning.
Doesn't get better than that.
There's been some brilliant Christmas records.
"Last Christmas, I gave you my heart." That one.
Christmas time Mistletoe and wine.
Shut up, Cliff. We don't want it.
It makes me want to throw myself off one. Stop.
I quite like Christmas records. I like, It's Christmas!
Merry Christmas, everybody!
I wish it could be...
I wish you would shut your mouth, cos I hate that song.
The best thing about it is you make a lot of money from it. Over the years.
It's Christmas! My throat's going now.
Anyone that works in retail hates Christmas music.
People'll point. "That's him. What did you make that record for?
"We're sick of it."
People love to come up
and tell you they don't like your Christmas record.
The reason for this is,
because they'll start playing it in October and finish in January
and you only have three Christmas CDs in the store.
I think they think that we go round
all the shops in October telling them to put our Christmas record on.
And that it's our fault.
It's like torture.
It's like somebody putting their nails down a blackboard.
All I want for Christmas... (is you)
Ooh...
One Christmas song that I will never forget.
It will live with me forever. It came out in 1976.
It was Johnny Mathis. When a child is born.
Give me a cheer if you remember the song.
A brilliant, brilliant song.
On New Year's Day, my dad took me to go and see Liverpool,
and this is where I saw the contrast between the culture of football
and the harmony of a Christmas song.
It came out in 1976.
And in 1976, I was ten years of age. My dad took me to the match.
He took me to go and watch Liverpool on New Year's Day.
I'll never forget this. We were playing Sunderland.
Liverpool were a good side then.
We were playing Sunderland, and what happened, they played that song.
And everybody started to sway. A ray of hope
Flickers across the land.
The scarves went up.
Huh huh, huh huh.
I didn't know the words when I was ten.
Huh huh, huh huh.
And there was a lovely harmony, as, in union, everybody was swaying.
And then, all of a sudden, one of the Sunderland defenders
came flying in at the back of Steve Heighway.
And as everybody swayed, the fellow next to me went,
"You dirty bastard!"
One of the big traditions every year is a panto. Who loves a panto?
Yeah!
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, yes, we do.
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, yes, we do!
Leave it out.
The panto, no, the panto's a lovely tradition. It's a lovely thing.
But it's also, from a showbiz point of view,
it's one of those things that you do at some time.
I've done two pantos.
The first panto I ever did was in Liverpool.
It was at the Royal Court in Liverpool.
It wasn't what you would call a high production value panto,
it was Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.
We couldn't afford dwarfs.
Dwarfs are quite expensive, particularly at Christmas,
they're very, very busy.
Aah!
So, what we did is we had kids with false heads on.
So, we had a load of kids with false heads on.
I was playing Herman the Henchman.
Scary part.
I was going to take Snow White into the woods
and kill her at some point.
I walked on to the stage. The room's full of mums and kids.
So, I walked on, I went, "The Evil Queen wants Snow White."
And then I was supposed to say something else. But I forgot.
So, as a comedian, I just went,
"All right, love, what's your name, where are you from?"
I did 15 minutes with this woman going,
"G'way, g'way with you."
Everyone's going, "What the friggin' hell are you doing?"
And then what happened is, throughout the panto,
my character, at one stage, had to chase one of the dwarfs.
It was just one of those things that happens in pantos,
someone chases somebody.
The problem was, the dwarf I was chasing wasn't really
very quick on their feet.
I was chasing them. There was a load of kids in the front row.
I caught the heel. As I caught the heel, he fell over.
The head fell off.
There was kids in the front row being sick.
They'd come out for some Christmas cheer,
they had Grumpy's head in their lap. Nobody was expecting that.
And the thing is, panto's something that everyone enjoys
cos it's a family thing.
Christmas is supposed to be a family time.
The reality is, it always ends up in an argument.
Every Christmas, there's always the same
family arguments.
I think it's the pressure of having a good time.
You know, you have to spend time with your family.
We get up together, we have breakfast together.
We open our presents together. We have a meal together.
We watch TV together. Phew...
Most families argue on Christmas Day through drink.
It's booze. Full stop.
My gran'd hit the whisky bottle, and I don't know what my mum
and my aunt were hitting.
By half past four, five o'clock, all hell used to break loose.
What should be a lovely holiday, a celebration and a relaxation...
has turned in, for me, to be the most stressful time of the year.
Off the Richter scale.
Arguments between Mum and Dad would always be,
"You don't do anything at Christmas." And, "I'm always doing all the work."
I wasn't aware you had any stress, because I thought it was me,
while you're getting cosy, that's charging round the supermarket,
fighting my way around the shops, getting the kids' presents,
wrapping the kids' presents...
The ironing, the cooking, the tree decoration.
..sorting out the Christmas cards, buying something for your mum,
buying something for my mum.
You mother is just like right on the edge of completely smashing
the whole kitchen up and losing it.
And there, playing my amiable host,
pouring the drinks that YOU'VE gone scouring round the supermarket for.
  No, could I just say?
  And eating the lovely food, the mince pies...
The mistake is...
..that we've made.
..because you treat men like adults. Men aren't adults. Christmas is for kids. Men are kids.
Hate it. Can't stand Christmas. Bah, humbug.
Stress, stress, stress, stress, stress. Christmas.
You have turned me off Christmas.
Oh, you know when the cameras went, it kicked off in that house, don't you?
But it's true. It's just stress over Christmas. And that's honest.
At least that's honest. There is stress at Christmas.
When I was kid,
they used to have this fella on the television called Val Doonican.
Remember Val Doonican?
Every Christmas, Val Doonican would be there with the Doonican family.
Val Doonican would come on with a lovely fine jumper.
He'd sit on a rocking chair in front of an open fire
with all Christmas decorations.
He'd look at the camera and go...
"Hope you're having a fine Christmas, like me."
I'd be sat there, I'd look back at the three bar fire
and think, "Not a friggin' chance."
Because what happens at Christmas is you end up doing stuff
as a family you wouldn't normally do.
Like games. You end up having to play games together.
And that's OK if the games are fair.
I was speaking to a mate of mine
and his father in law, every year, insists that they Trivial Pursuit.
But his father in law has got Trivial Pursuit from 1982.
So, every time, he says, "Right, who's the England manager?"
"Fabio Capello."
"No, Bobby Robson!"
And now, things have changed as well,
cos you get all of these other things.
These Wiis and stuff like that. And you get these Kinect.
You get these games.
I don't know if you've seen this Xbox Kinect.
What happens with Xbox Kinect now
is that you don't actually control anything.
You don't do anything. My kids got one this year. I was like them.
What happens is, you stand there, like that.
And then you play your stuff, like that.
So, I was playing it. I was like that. I was playing it.
I was doing it, I was giving it a go. I was like that.
One of my mates phoned up. He says, "Is Bez in your living room?"
And the thing is, there's always arguments,
and everyone seems to be surprised why there's arguments.
You get relatives in a small room, full of booze,
what on earth can go wrong?
There's bound to be arguments
because there's always that little bit, isn't it?
There's always that tension.
It always starts off early in the morning.
It's like, "Who got up first?"
It's like, "I've been peeling potatoes since six o'clock."
"I bought all the presents yesterday."
"Well, I was thinking about the presents in September."
It just goes on and on and on.
And then you sit there and you get all tense and tense and tense.
And then, at some point in the day, you're looking at the television and
the television's going, underneath, where it's scrolling those words,
"Think of those people who are alone this Christmas."
And you think, "Yeah, you lucky bastards."
So, that was Christmas.
Tonight, Britain has taught me that Noddy knows Santa,
the best cows fart
and you should never buy a blender as a present.
Thank you. Goodnight and God bless.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
