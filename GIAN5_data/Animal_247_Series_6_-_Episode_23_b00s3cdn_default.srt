Britain's animals are under threat.
All too often, our wildlife and domestic pets
are the victims of cruelty, persecution and neglect.
Fighting to save them is a dedicated band of people
trying to protect and care for them right around the clock.
This is Animal 24:7.
Today on Animal 24:7, has Bullseye the Staffie been beaten?
We've actually got a few witnesses.
There's a stick and a broom at the front of your house,
do you use any of those items to hit your dog?
How does this year compare to others for you?
In the 16 years since I've been with the RSPCA, I've never known
so many abandoned in such a short space of time.
And there's plenty of hungry mouths to feed at Weirfield.
People often find them in their gardens because their mums
know they're not going to hibernate,
and so their mums will actually leave them and let nature take its course.
First, we're in the capital, where the RSPCA has received
reports that a young Staffie has been hit with a stick.
But it'll not be a simple case.
Owners rarely admit to hitting their pets,
and unless eyewitnesses are willing to give statements,
inspectors can find these allegations
almost impossible to prove.
Camberwell, South East London, and RSPCA inspector Becky London,
is investigating complaints that a dog has allegedly been beaten.
There's a dog being kept in the front yard
which has supposedly got a big lump on its head,
so I need to investigate why it's got a lump and if it has.
Also, I've been told that the dog might be getting hit,
so I just need to speak to some people
regarding this and see what they've got to say for themselves.
At the house, Becky is greeted by a friendly Staffie called Bullseye.
Hello!
Straightaway her suspicions are raised.
It has got a lump on its head, but it feels quite hard.
But although Becky has spotted a lump,
she can't assume it's been caused by cruelty.
He might have been born like it, it might have a medical condition.
I need to speak to the owner just to see what it is.
But it doesn't feel soft, it actually just feels like it's the bone.
And in the yard, she gets a chance to take a closer look at where Bullseye's living.
It looks quite clean out here.
He's got some little tea towel toys.
There's no bedding in its cage.
Hello?
Hi, I'm from the RSPCA,
I just want to have a quick word with you about your dog.
Hello. Is this your dog?
The owner's not at home, but his friend is.
Can I just ask you something, do you live here, as well?
No, I'm only his friend, just walking the dog for him.
Oh, OK, you walk the dog for him.
OK, Have you ever struck the dog at all,
with your hand or with a broom or with a stick?
  No, no.
  You haven't?
How is this dog disciplined if it's naughty?
  I can't tell...
  You can tell me?
Why, what d'you do then?
I don't know, I can't tell you...
Becky needs to question the owner, so asks the friend to call him.
Can I speak to him now, please? I will literally be really quick.
I can't go till I speak to him, really.
Yes, I'm just enquiring about the lump on his head, can you tell me what that is, please?
Because Bullseye's active,
the owner says he's not concerned about the bump.
But Becky's worried the dog may have suffered a serious head injury.
Obviously, the dog is quite alert,
but for a dog to get a lump of that size,
something significant has happened to that dog's head.
The owner explains that Bullseye developed the lump a week ago.
But persuading him to take responsibility for
the welfare of his pet is proving difficult.
You need to get this dog to the vet this week for a check up,
otherwise I'll be taking the dog to the vet myself.
The fact it isn't down to a birth defect
makes a visit to the vet all the more crucial.
It's obviously got a lump for a reason, you don't know what it is.
Something significant has happened to his head.
Whether it's been stuck by a stick or a broom...
I have to admit I've got a few witnesses who have seen you hit the dog.
And her suspicions are fuelled by what might be a significant clue.
There's a stick at the front of your house and also a broom.
Do you use any of those items to hit your dog?
The owner denies hitting his dog,
and Becky is getting more and more frustrated.
Which vet is the dog registered with?
He's not registered with a vet?
So are you telling me that you've not got time to take your dog to the vet?
I can't... Obviously, that's...
That's not acceptable. I'll be removing the dog now,
I'll be taking it to the vet myself and getting the vet
to have a look at the lump.
If there's anything suspicious,
then obviously I'll be coming back to speak to you about it.
Becky will continue her investigations later.
Oh, excuse me?
You haven't got a dog lead that he uses,
that the dog is used to or anything?
For now though, there's enough to justify removing Bullseye to get him seen by a vet.
Come on.
I'll just get a picture of how it was when I came in.
Before she leaves, Becky returns to gather evidence.
The cage without bedding...
and the broom handles, could all help in building a picture of how Bullseye has been treated.
Half an hour later, Becky arrives at the local vet.
Bullseye's clearly excited about being in the great outdoors.
The Staffie will have to wait for his appointment with the vet,
but at least he's got a warm, comfortable shelter,
which will make a welcome change from his cage in the yard.
I'm just going to make the dog a bed, give it some food and water and just settle the dog down.
It didn't have a comfortable bed,
so I'm giving it some nice blankets.
It will be a luxury to this dog.
Proving allegations of dog beating is notoriously difficult,
but Becky is determined to get to the truth.
There are a few eye witnesses who have heard the dog being hit and noises when the dog
has been yelping and crying, so it's all quite suspicious.
What happens to Bullseye now
will all depend on the results of Becky's inquiries
and what the vet has to say.
If there's anything dodgy regarding the lump on its head
then the dog will be seized and taken into our care.
If there's nothing wrong with the dog, if it's a medical condition
or nothing the vet's worried about,
then the dog will be returned to the owner.
We just need to speak to a few witnesses, speak to the vet,
but at the moment I don't know what's going to happen.
Later, the vet's verdict is in.
She does believe that the lump on the head
is a result of being struck by something,
but as yet I don't know what that is.
And pampering the puppies dumped over Christmas.
You get nothing but the salon best, don't you?
You look a bit of a mangy rat when you're all wet.
For any wildlife rescuer, releasing animals back into the wild
is the most rewarding part of the job.
But often it's not as simple as just opening the box and letting them go.
There are many obstacles to overcome
and at Weirfield Wildlife Hospital, they take extra care
to make sure the release of every animal
gives them the best possible chance of survival.
Winter is approaching in Lincolnshire...
..and Ali Townshend is as busy as ever.
Weirfield hospital is brimming with all kinds of wildlife
needing round the clock care and attention.
And Ali's latest prickly admissions are no exception.
We're coming up to the end of October now.
These babies we've got in now
will be the second litters of the hedgehogs born this year.
These are going to be too little to hibernate.
We need them to be a good weight for hibernation and these youngsters will now stay with us until spring.
There are currently 20 baby hedgehogs
in the hospital to care for.
They need to be fed around the clock.
These hedgehogs are doing very well.
When they came in they were half their size,
so we're quite pleased, really.
These are now almost eating on their own,
and that's quite an achievement.
If it wasn't for Ali, these baby hogs wouldn't survive the winter.
People often find them in their gardens because their mums know
they're not going to hibernate and they're not going to be big enough,
so they'll actually leave them and let nature take that its course.
They're not very good, hedgehog mums, really.
As well as babies, Ali is also caring for this adult hedgehog.
This unfortunate chap was keeping warm in the long grass
when he was seriously injured by a strimmer.
The bit you're actually looking at at the minute, that's his back,
so we're looking at the top of his head, which is often the case.
When hedgehogs are out in the wild and they hear a noise, they'll curl into a tight ball.
They won't actually run away, therefore, when people are strimming,
the hedgehogs just curl up into a ball and unfortunately the strimmer
just takes the top off.
This hedgehog was obviously wounded some time ago.
We find that, sometimes, we've got lots of maggots in the wound.
Sometimes they do very well, because they'll actually clean the wound up for us before we get it,
so although it looks quite bad, he's eating exceptionally well,
he's having some antibiotics and he's doing everything a hedgehog should,
so we're holding high hopes for him at the minute.
It's not just about treating the wound.
In a few weeks' time this hog should be hibernating,
but at the moment he simply
doesn't have enough fat reserves to survive the three month sleep.
I'll put him back to bed.
Ali needs to feed him up to give him the best chance possible.
And hedgehogs aren't the only creatures trying to survive the cold.
This grey squirrel is only a few weeks old.
Ali is hand feeding him milk every two hours.
He's so tiny he may not survive.
But his size isn't the only obstacle  
grey squirrels aren't native to Britain, so, even if he lives,
Ali will have to apply for a licence to release him back to the wild.
At the Wildlife Hospital here
we believe that everything has a right to live.
It has come in because it's ill,
and why shouldn't it have the right to be looked after?
For now, this little fellow needs the comforts of a woolly blanket
and the expert care of his foster mum.
It's now December at Weirfield,
and there's one patient who's fast asleep.
The strimmed hedgehog is out of hospital, recovering well,
and beginning to show all the signs that he's ready to hibernate.
He's doing all the right things.
This hutch looks an absolute mess, but in actual fact it's good.
He's taken all his bedding and made a beautiful nest in the corner to keep warm.
He's eating well, he's taking all his food.
So, Ali needs to wake him and check his wound to see if he's fat enough to survive the long winter alone.
As we can see, it's healed absolutely beautifully.
There's no open bits to it at all,
and even the spines are starting to poke through.
I'm really, really pleased with this hedgehog.
He's also gained enough weight to convince Ali he can survive
the three months in hibernation.
Yes, I think we can safely say he can go for release today.
This is a great part of our job.
We see an animal that comes in with an horrific wound,
and has really gone through a lot to get himself back to being healthy.
This is a great bit.
Normally, Ali would release a hedgehog where she found it,
but the back garden where this one came from
is clearly an unsafe place.
Ali's chosen another site where she knows he'll have a fighting chance of making it.
The reason we've picked this house is because there's somebody here
that will make sure he's got water and food
so he can supplement until he gets used to being back in the wild.
He's got some logs that he can go and hide under, there's a nice compost heap at the bottom of the garden,
and the garden actually goes out into open fields,
so, even if he decides not to stay, there's plenty of area for him.
Ali needs to transfer the hedgehog into a specially designed box.
This will be a warm and cosy bedroom for him to continue his hibernation.
But, if he decides to wake up, this garden will be perfect for him.
Obviously, we want him to stay until it's dark.
He may stay in for a few days, he may not even come out.
We want him to feel secure, so he's got food, he's got
bedding in there, and we'll bring him some water out later.
We may not see this hedgehog again, but hopefully we'll hear reports of him snuffling around the garden,
eating the apples and disappearing under the compost heap.
It's been a successful and simple release for Ali,
but not every animal she deals with is so straightforward.
Coming up, boxing the badger ready for release.
It's actually quite frightened at the minute.
We want him to stay spooky.
And a hazardous move for Inspector London.
As I was carrying it down the stairwell I got bitten.
I've had my tetanus jabs so hopefully I'm covered
for any potential diseases I might have caught.
The bleak midwinter
must be one of the cruellest times to be made homeless.
Yet, in one of our most unpleasant Christmas traditions,
it's around now when we tend to dump many of our pets.
Here in Cambridgeshire this year,
the RSPCA have had a record number of unwanted presents.
We're supposed to be a nation of animal lovers,
but these photos paint a very different picture.
These are just some of the pets dumped
over a single Christmas period.
Some are unwanted Christmas presents,
others dumped before the festive holidays.
But, whatever the reason, they're all sad stories.
At Block Fen RSPCA Animal Home in Wimblington,
staff are now pulling out all the stops,
dealing with more abandonments than ever before.
I'm meeting with manager, Jackie Hickman, to find out more.
These are just a handful of your unwanted presents.
They are indeed. We had in total 11 abandoned over the New Year.
These four were abandoned in a cardboard box
outside the recycling area at Morrisons in King's Lynn.
Another litter were abandoned in a cardboard box
outside somebody's front door.
So these four kittens, more cats besides, what else?
Two puppies, that were found in a beautiful wicker basket
outside somebody's house again,
and a cockerel that was actually left in a very shallow cardboard box
outside our front door here at the centre.
So that was 11 animals in how long?
In a matter of four days.
We often talk about the classic,
"A pet is for life, not just for Christmas,"
but how does this year compare to others for you?
In the 16 years I've been with the RSPCA,
I've never known so many abandoned in such a short space of time.
These are the lucky ones, really, because these have been found.
These have been brought to us, fed, cared for...
How many others have been abandoned that haven't been found?
When these kittens were found, they were healthy.
Unfortunately, though, some of the animals that have been taken in
had already begun to suffer.
Meet Dodger and Oliver, two eight week old puppies
that were dumped in a wicker basket under a bush.
When they were found they were freezing cold and emaciated.
Come on, boys.
Vet Rebecca Aylesbury believes if they hadn't been rescued,
they would certainly have died.
And what have you had to do to them since they came in and what's still left to do at the moment?
The first thing was, they were in a state of hypothermia
so we had to warm them up.
They also had raging haemorrhagic diarrhoea,
so they were extremely dehydrated
so we had to give them fluid replacements.
What's haemorrhagic diarrhoea, as opposed to normal diarrhoea?
Producing blood.
So there's blood in the diarrhoea? That sounds pretty serious.
It was very serious for them.
If you feel them...
You feel how thin they are.
There's no reserves on them, so they were fighting the cold to keep warm,
and they were fighting the disease of their intestines.
The puppies have been fed and wormed,
and are making a great recovery,
but it's vital Rebecca keeps an eye on their well being.
So, we take them to the surgery for their latest appointment.
Let's get Dodger on first, shall we?
It starts with a weigh in.
  1.39, no, 1.41.
  Excellent.
A wee bit heavier, this one.
Again, that's a good weight gain.
He was 1.17 when he first came in.
In only five days, you can see how much they're increasing in weight.
You can see how thin they must have been when they came in.
Yes, terrible.
Next, Rebecca needs to check their hearts.
Brilliant, no heart murmurs at all.
And their ears.
All looking good in there?
Really good. Much, much better today.
Oliver and Dodger have certainly come a long way since being found,
but there are still signs of their suffering.
Because of the malnutrition, their bones have bent slightly,
so they've got enlarged joints here.
As time has gone on, and we've been supplementing them with,
not only milk but a special puppy intestinal food,
their limbs have got much straighter.
Already? In the short space of time you've had them
their limbs are already straightened out?
Yes, they're really improving there.
So, although they had a really bow legged look when they came in,
there's a little left now, it'll be fine when they grow up?
  Absolutely fine.
  So you really did catch them in time?
  Yeah.
Lovely. So, it's a clean bill of health for these two,
but there's still one more treatment to come.
When they were brought in,
both Dodger and Oliver were filthy, and their skin was sore.
There you go, how do you like that?
Part of their treatment involves regular medicated baths.
Just rub it in? No special techniques to shampooing a puppy?
No. It must feel a little itchy
and I think this must be soothing for them.
They probably like the pampering, like the attention?
You look a bit of a mangy rat, when you're all wet.
That's the bath over, but it's not the end of their beauty regime.
You get nothing but the salon best, don't you?
It's time for the hairdryer to get to work.
Why do you need to blow dry them? It seems a bit pampering.
Yes, but what we don't want is them to get cold again.
They've not got enough fat and reserves on their body
to warm themselves up, so we want to make sure they're completely dry.
  Is it one at a time?
  One at a time.
You don't like it blowing in your face, do you, little one?
Been anywhere nice on your holidays, then?
And pretty soon our drowned rats have turned into real bundles
of fluff and they can finally have their dinner.
So what's the future for these two, now?
We'll get more weight on them, make sure that their limbs are straightening up
and then we'll look for a new home for them.
There's no reason why they can't go and find a perfectly good home?
No, and we'll try and find one sooner rather than later.
They're so friendly, they clearly like people,
it makes it even sadder that they were just dumped without anyone.
It's very cruel, and if you can't look after your puppy,
unfortunately it would be better if you could seek help
rather than just leave them on the street,
or, as these two were found, in a little basket under a hedge.
  It's pretty cowardly, isn't it? Just to dump them and run?
  It really is.
Especially with chaps as nice as this, who have now finished their milk and are running away.
Healthy, bathed and fed, these two were in a great place now.
But what they really need are loving new homes.
All the recently abandoned animals here are being very well cared for,
but that doesn't excuse dumping them in the first place.
The RSPCA would far rather
people made the effort to actually care for their animals
or, at the very least, bring them in, in person.
Later, the cute creature sparking debate at Weirfield.
There are people who believe
that the grey squirrel shouldn't be re released.
It does cause fun, and it does cause a lot of controversy.
Now, we're back to the capital.
Earlier, we saw RSPCA inspector Becky London take away a Staffie
called Bullseye after receiving reports that he'd been beaten.
Bullseye is now being held at the vets, while Becky begins
the complicated investigation into what really happened.
When Becky first saw Bullseye,
it wasn't clear how he got the bump on his head.
She suspected a deliberate injury, but the swelling could also have
been the result of a birth abnormality.
Her inquiry depended on the results of a medical examination.
This morning I phoned the vet
who explained that she's assessed the dog.
She does believe that the lump on the head
is a result of being struck by something,
but as yet I don't know what that is,
whether it's a car or whether it's by a stick, we're still not sure.
To support the allegations that Bullseye was beaten,
Becky needs to take statements from the people who made the complaint.
Hello, it's Inspector London here from the RSPCA,
just giving you another call.
I do need to ask you whether or not you're willing to be a witness and if
you've actually seen the dog being hit or beaten with anything.
OK, thank you, bye.
But gathering this vital evidence isn't always easy.
This morning's been frustrating. I've spent nearly two hours on the phone.
I've been trying to get hold of the actual dog owner,
who's now turned his phone off, so I can't reach him.
I've got another couple of witnesses who I'm struggling to get a hold of. I've left messages
and they're not answering, so it's frustrating I can't get hold of these people.
Without the statements, Becky won't be able to take the case forward.
But more worrying are the serious consequences
it could have for Bullseye's welfare.
If we have a lack of witnesses, the dog may have to go back to the owner,
which, if it has been struck,
is unfair on the dog and I don't want that to happen.
At the moment I'm still unsure of what's going to happen.
Bullseye's future is still uncertain,
but for the moment at least, he's in a safe place.
It's commonly believed that in Britain
we're never more than six feet away from a rat.
Not that you'd normally see them.
These shy and elusive creatures
usually live in a world beneath our feet,
in the drains and sewers of our cities and towns.
But although they're generally considered vermin,
some people do like to keep them as pets.
Now Becky is responding to a tip off
that a cage full of rodents has been left out in the cold.
Apparently five rats have been abandoned in their original cage,
just left in a front garden outside someone's property,
so I'm going to have a look now.
It's winter at the moment, we've got gale force winds this week,
so they're probably shivering in the cold.
I don't know what state the cage is in, whether they've got bedding,
food, water, if they're in a skinny state...
I don't know what I'm going to find here.
Hello? I'm from the RSPCA, I've had a call about some rats, are you going to let me through, please?
Becky needs to find the rodents as quickly as possible,
before the resident cats and the cold weather start to bite.
I'm in a jumper and I can feel the cold at the moment,
so if these rats are exposed in an open cage
they're going to really be feeling this cold weather, which isn't good.
She phones the original caller back.
Hello, I'm calling from the RSPCA...
Who tells her the rats are actually in her flat.
She comes home to let Becky take them away.
I've just gone in there and seen five are in a cage.
The cage is quite nice,
so whether the whole cage has been dumped with the rats...
We'll just wait seven days to see if the owner comes forward.
If they do, then obviously I'll want to investigate why these rats have been abandoned.
If nobody comes forward, we're just going to simply re home them all.
Where was this cage found?
Becky now has the tricky task of manoeuvring
the large cage out of the flat and down several flights of stairs.
It's certainly a smelly job.
Oh, they stink!
I'll have to disinfect my van after this!
Becky's nostrils weren't the only thing to be assaulted during the transfer.
As I was carrying it down the stairwell I got bitten.
I've had my tetanus jab, so hopefully I'm covered
for any potential diseases I might have caught.
The feisty five all appear to be in good health,
but Becky has some concerns about the way they've been kept.
They're thirsty, When I got to the house the water bottle was empty.
We put water in there, and these two are just a drinking away.
They might have gone without water for some time.
The cage needs a good clean.
They've been in this for a while, it hasn't been changed in a while.
You can smell strong urine coming from them.
The rat's odour issues will easily be remedied
by a thorough spring clean back at the RSPCA centre.
It's going to go in long ways, so if you put your end...
That's lovely, thanks very much.
Unlike their wild cousins who enjoy a life of grime,
tame rats, also known as fancy rats, are clean creatures.
Just like other household pets, they need lots of care and attention
to ensure they remain in tip top condition.
Back at base, Becky's ready to tackle the smelly job of cleaning out their cage.
Having already suffered one nasty nip from an agitated rodent,
this time she's prepared.
I'm just going to get these rats out one by one
and move them to a bigger cage so they can have some exercise
whilst I gut and clean this cage out.
Come out!
The rats are hardly in a rush to vacate their dirty den, though.
Oh, they're so wriggly!
But, with a little persuasion...
One by one...
There you go!
The fancy five are removed from their filthy home.
There you go.
Now Becky can get to work.
After giving the cage floor a good rinse and a scrub,
it's time to make their beds.
And shredded newspaper will be ideal
to help these rodents feel warm and cosy.
I don't want the last one escaping.
Finally, with the cage spotless,
Becky can return the five to familiar territory.
That's it!
Job finished, I think the rats will be much happier in here now.
They're already starting to play with the newspaper,
so we'll leave them to settle down and get them
re homed as soon as possible.
Still to come, will Bullseye learn to listen?
It's very important that he knows the basics, so that when he does go
he's not as much of a handful as if he wasn't trained at all.
Stop it! Enough!
Now we're back at Weirfield Animal Hospital in Lincoln, where owner,
Ali Townsend, is dealing with all kinds of winter releases.
Earlier, she released a sleepy hedgehog
in time for him to begin his hibernation.
Now she has two very different animals to set free,
but not without complications.
Throughout the year,
Ali has been nursing several injured badgers back to health.
Badgers are tough, and will stand up to just about any opponent.
Even if the challenge is an oncoming vehicle.
Like many, this one is the victim of a road accident.
It's been out now, probably three weeks...
Animal welfare officer Kate Burris was on duty the night he was hit.
When I got there the badger was still quite active, but there was quite a lot of blood on the road.
I didn't think it would last 24 hours, to be honest.
I think with the shock, and there was an injury under the chin,
there did seem to be a lot of blood,
and it did have an injury to its front leg.
I think it got to us about 11:30.
He was kept nice and warm,
was given some rehydration fluid to build him back up.
He was a bit dehydrated from the blood loss.
He stayed in the hospital for a week.
After a week he was doing exceptionally well,
so it was decided to bring him outside and put him into
an aviary where he could recover at his own pace, really,
and obviously keep him as wild as possible.
Now, as night falls...
Right, Kate.
..it's time for this tough fella to go back home.
I need you to hang on to the kennel,
because if he goes in with quite a whoosh, we need to just put him in.
But being wild means catching him may not be easy.
Do you want some straw in there?
Badgers can give a nasty bite.
He's actually quite frightened at the minute.
We want him to stay spooky.
I'll just put some of this smelly stuff in for him,
so that's his smell.
Ali can't risk getting any closer to this badger,
but with a gentle nudge of her trusty broom...
She helps him on his way.
Badgers are territorial animals,
so he's being taken back to where he was found five weeks ago.
And, as they're nocturnal, this is the perfect time to send him on his way.
So our camera lights don't disturb him,
we're using a special night vision camera to capture the moment.
This location is the exact spot where the badger was hit on the road.
We try to bring them back to the area that they've come from
purely so they know where they are and it's a known set to them.
Hopefully, once he gets a smell of where he is,
he'll just disappear off and go back to his location.
With the door open, it doesn't take long for this badger's senses to tell him he's home.
I can hear him smelling and sniffing,
so he's obviously getting accustomed to where he is.
Moments later, he makes a break for freedom.
He's disappeared under there somewhere  
quite nicely pootling along.
And Ali's confident he'll follow his nose
all the way back to the old set.
This one seemed to know where he was, took a nice sniff to the air,
worked out where he was, and plodded off quite nicely.
To me, that's a good release.
It really is amazing to be able to see him go back out
to where he was picked up from, and I really didn't think that he would.
A job well done, and a sleepy Ali can now head back to bed, too.
But every new day brings another important release.
And this next one raises a controversial debate.
The baby grey squirrel is now big enough to enjoy
life outside in an aviary, and is about to make big news.
Because we had so many squirrels that came into the Wildlife Hospital
we decided we'd go for a licence.
What we have to do is we have a generic licence that,
depending on how many we have in from one year to the next,
this year we've got a licence to release ten.
So this is number one of our new licence.
There are over 2 million grey squirrels in this country.
The decision to release them isn't always a popular one.
Many people hold the grey squirrels responsible
for the decline in our native red squirrel.
They're stronger, more competitive,
and can also carry a virus which is lethal to the reds.
We need to have a licence for the grey squirrel because it's non native to this country.
Obviously, there are people who believe the grey squirrel shouldn't be re released.
It does cause fun, and it does cause a lot of controversy, but we believe
here at Weirfield that everything has got a right to survive
and everything has got a right to live.
That's why we went ahead and got the licence.
Right.
Squirrels are quick, agile and tricky to catch.
But Ali makes it look simple.
That was considerably easier than I expected!
Once in the cage,
this squirrel seems desperate to make a break for it.
That's why we don't put them in cardboard boxes.
So Ali wastes no time in setting off to the release site.
The licence states she must release him within one kilometre of where he was found.
Ali moves deeper into the forest to find the perfect place to release her grey.
OK, I think this is quite a good area.
There are plenty of trees and there are some resident squirrels
I can hear in the trees. I think we'll just go here.
And, like every release,
it's impossible to know how it's going to go.
Sometimes they shoot out very rapidly, and sometimes they'll
just sit there a few minutes and decide that, "Oh, I've got freedom".
It's quite a shock to them, really,
so they can be two or three minutes sometimes coming out.
But this one is off like a shot.
I can see him at the top of the tree, now.
There was another youngster around so he looks fairly pleased to be away.
Obviously, it's a good part of our job
to get him from being rehabilitated back into the wild.
He's sat up there quite nicely.
Earlier, we were with RSPCA inspector Becky London, as she
attempted to get to the bottom of two cases of neglect.
She's already taken charge of five pet rats
from a flat in Bermondsey, south London
and just down the road in Camberwell,
she's struggling to get to the truth
about what really happened to Bullseye  
a Staffie with an unexplained lump on his head.
Two months have passed since Becky took Bullseye away from his owner.
She was unable to prove that his head injury
was a result of being beaten,
but finally his owner did agree to sign him over to the RSPCA.
Bullseye...
He's now being looked after at a boarding kennels,
but today's short trip out with Tara Boswell
could be the beginning of a much bigger journey for Bullseye.
We're going to the vet now for Bullseye's final health check to check he's all OK,
that everything's fine, the lump on his head has completely gone,
then he can be re homed.
His energetic and boisterous behaviour suggests he's not
suffered any long term damage from the bang to his head.
But the final say on whether he's fit enough for adoption
will be down to the vet, Sonia Miller Smith.
Good morning.
  Hello.
  How has he been?
He's been really good.
The visible signs of the head trauma have disappeared,
so Sonia needs to check his overall health.
Let's have a look at you.
But it's not easy with such a hyperactive dog.
And how is that bump on his head settling?
It's gone now, it's completely gone.
That's fine. He looks really well.
Completely better, just a little bit mad, aren't you?
As far as I'm concerned, he's absolutely fine to re home now.
He's lovely, he'll make someone a great pet.
With the green light from vet, Sonia,
Bullseye's almost ready to be put up for adoption.
But there's still one more hurdle for him to overcome.
Bullseye is a real handful.
  Tara is going to have to instil some discipline into him.
  No, Bullseye!
To give him the best chance of finding new owners.
If we're trying to re home him, it's very important
that he knows the basics, so that when he does go he's not as much of
a handful as what he is if he wasn't trained at anything at all  
if he wasn't taught any basic obedience.
Right. Stop it! Enough!
Stop it!
This isn't going to be easy.
What's this?
Oi! What's this?
But it's amazing what a few doggy treats can get you.
Sit. Good boy!
And, slowly but surely,
Bullseye begins to show that he can listen after all.
Sit...good boy. Good boy. Good boy.
And Tara is confident that with the right owner,
Bullseye will be a perfect pet.
He just needs someone who's willing to put the time in to train him
and do that basic obedience with him.
He's very energetic so he'll need lots of nice walks.
He's had a hard start. It would be nice to find him a nice home,
someone that can take care of him and give him the life he deserves.
