Today, I am travelling through an area that is packed full of natural beauty and steeped in history.
This is Pembrokeshire on the wild west coast of Wales.
My journey begins on horseback at Druidston Beach.
I'll head inland to paddle along the western branch of the River Cleddau
at Haverfordwest before veering north to Wolfscastle.
Then it's back to the coast at Milford Haven
before rustling up a seafood feast at Neyland Marina.
And along the way,
I'll be looking back at some of the best of the BBC's rural programmes for this part of the world.
Welcome to Country Tracks.
Pembrokeshire, one of the most beautiful corners of Britain.
It's famed for miles of jagged cliffs, abundant wildlife and glorious beaches.
The estuary is heavily industrialised but further north, Pembrokeshire stands utterly wild.
This is Druidston Beach on St Brides Bay.
The dramatic rocks, white sands and crystal waters
make it a truly magical place and I'm experiencing it on horseback.
This remote beach doesn't have the facilities for sunbathers or surfers.
Just an empty expanse of sand, a long stretch of surf and dozens of galloping hooves.
This is all very new to me.
I think poor Speckles here drew the short straw this morning
but there is no place I'd rather be right now.
This is absolutely glorious.
James, how long has your family been in Pembrokeshire?
We've been in Pembrokeshire for hundreds of years.
We've always been farming, always had beef cattle and dairy herd.
When did you move into this fantastic industry, into trekking?
My grandfather always had horses on the farm and he bought a couple of ponies for my dad and his brothers
and they were riding down on the beach and found out
that a lot of people wanted to have a go, so it's taken off from there.
What is it about Pembrokeshire that makes it so ideal for this kind of activity?
We've got fantastic beaches and great, wide open spaces so we're very lucky.
We've got four beaches within two miles of the property.
That makes it easy for us to get down to all these secluded beaches.
Do you ever have any conflict between beach users and people who want to use your horses?
No, not really.
Druidston, the beach we're on today, is really secluded.
It's got no car park, no shop,
no other facilities, so a lot of people prefer to go to the bigger beached
  I presume you've been horse riding since you were a wee nipper.
  Yeah.
It was a pony instead of a pushchair.
We all started very young.
The two young ladies here on the small ponies...
They're my nieces, Lily and Holly, and they're four and two.
They can't get enough of the ponies, riding every day.
What generation are they in the trekking business?
They are the fourth generation.
  Will they become instructors?
  Probably, I can see them telling me what to do before too long actually.
You probably have the best day job I've ever come across.
  I know, this is my office. A great office.
  Absolutely heaven.
  Would you teach me how to trot a little bit better now?
  No problem.
  Excellent!
  Here we go.
Something tells me my technique is all wrong.
Try as I might, Speckles is in no rush.
I want to do that again, that was rubbish!
But all of a sudden, we're off.
It's a great feeling, but it's left to the Owen family to show me how it's really done.
Now, at the very northern tip of St Brides Bay,
tucked around that peninsula over there, is Whitesands Bay.
Come on.
And that is where Charlotte Smith joined the Celtic Trail cycle path.
I first started coming to this beach when I was about six and I spent all my time in the sea.
My cycle ride takes me from coast to coast, starting here at Whitesands Bay near St David's
and 18 miles later, ending up on Strumble Head, I hope.
It's undoubtedly beautiful but I'm a bit worried about this route.
I haven't come very far and already I'm off the bike and pushing
because this is such a steep hill. There'd better not be too many more.
So how many steep hills am I facing on my route?
Actually, there are just a few.
You've just come up the worst one to get on to the plateau surface.
The landscape to the north of St David's
and along your route to the Strumble peninsula is actually dominated
by a plateau surface with just a few steep sided valleys
and one or two isolated, craggy hills, or tors, sticking out of that surface.
What about slate? That is what I associate with Pembrokeshire.
Will I be seeing lots of that or cycling over it?
You'll be seeing slate, particularly on the coast at places like Abereiddy,
at the Blue Lagoon, a flooded slate quarry.
Have I chosen a good route then, Sid?
It's my favourite part of Pembrokeshire coast scenery.
It's a beautiful route and you've got a fantastic day.
Well, that WAS tempting fate and inevitably, it's already clouding over!
St David's Cathedral   it makes that big hill worthwhile.
Pilgrims have been visiting the shrine of St David since the sixth century.
My route follows the Celtic Trail which is even older.
It's a trade route dating back to the Bronze Age.
I wonder if they had this much rain then.
I'm going downhill to get to the Blue Lagoon, slightly off my route
but well worth a visit   and not just because it's downhill.
And this is the Blue Lagoon then.
  Yeah.
  What makes it that colour?
The slate has given it that colour, the chemicals from the slate
have deteriorated and it gives the colour of the Blue Lagoon.
It's fabulous, even in this slightly horrible weather.
Yes, but they started cutting here in 1840.
They finished completely in 1904.
Economics, it was such a poor quality slate,
it only had a life expectancy of 40 years on cutting.
When did it become open to the sea?
In 1926, the local villagers saw the potential that if they could get access to the sea,
this would make an ideal safe anchorage for their small boats.
So they managed to obtain some gelignite from another source...
  You mean they borrowed it!
  They borrowed some from nearby quarries
and they managed to blast through an entrance out to the sea, to provide shelter for the small boats.
  What's that little round building?
  The round building,
some people will tell you the quarry manager built it for his wife
to have afternoon teas in it, but it was a lookout for the ships arriving. That's all it was.
  I like the tea story.
  Yes, yes.
  Much more romantic.
  Isn't it?
The Celtic Trail is really well signposted so there aren't too many excuses for getting lost
and most of it is on small, quiet back roads, although you do see the odd car so you've got to be careful.
There is one problem, as you can probably see,
when it rains here, it really rains and there aren't too many places to shelter, which is a shame.
This is the village of Mathry, and it has a great Celtic legend attached to it.
It concerns a woman who had seven sons in seven years.
For the next seven years, much to her great relief no doubt, she didn't have any more children.
But then she had septuplets, another seven sons.
Her husband decided that they were too poor to be able to cope
and he was going to have to drown the children.
But when he got to the river, he met St Teilo,
who rescued the boys and brought them up in the local monastery.
They went on to live happy and blameless lives.
They're now known as the Saints of Mathry,
just another local legend? Well, they did find seven identical graves all in a row.
It's stopped raining...
..but it's still hilly.
I'm about halfway along the route now
and I have diverted to come here, to Llangloffan, where they make cheese.
Leon Downey used to be a viola player with the Halle Orchestra in Manchester.
But he gave it all up for this.
The cheese making process is just fascinating.
How long does it take to come up with one of these?
This cheese, we start at 6 o'clock in the morning. Three days later,
it goes into the cheese store to mature.
Depending on how mature we want it, perhaps up to 18 months.
  These get very mouldy in the cheese store.
  That's proper, isn't it?
If mould didn't grow on it, there would be something wrong with the cheese.
We immerse the whole cheese in water and scrub it up
so the visitors never know the cheese was covered in mould.
Have you just given me all the secrets of the trade now?
You're missing out really important bits that makes this cheese your cheese, aren't you?
Yeah, the reason this cheese is my cheese is because I make it.
Every cheesemaker is an individual.
They put their own character into the cheese,
just like playing the violin. Nobody plays Beethoven's Violin Concerto the same.
It starts from the heart. Same with cheese. That's why musicians pack up and go and make cheese.
Orchestras full of cheesemakers!
This is a very weird place for weather, Pembrokeshire, isn't it?
Pembrokeshire weather is amazingly weird.
You get up in the morning, "What a rotten day!"
By lunchtime, the sun is out and you wouldn't think that the day started off black.
I'm nearly at the end, which judging by the sounds of my brakes, is just as well.
But first, I'm going to meet up with Freddie and Cliff who've spent the day on the coast, looking for seals.
  Hi!
  Hi!
  What have I missed?
  Nothing really. There's quite a lot of seals here.
There's a baby just down there.
Not more than a couple of days old.
There are parents around, a couple of older ones.
Why isn't the baby in the water then?
It would get a bit cold.
Really? It waits till it gets fat, does it?
It's damn near newborn so basically, it's going to need feeding.
It stays up there, its coat isn't thick enough to do much swimming.
Why is this such a good place for seals? Are they always here?
This is a breeding season so we've got...probably from September until October is the main time.
There are probably several thousand of them on the Pembrokeshire coast.
Have you seen any porpoise?
No, do you get those as well?
  Yeah.
  This is the best place in the British mainland to see porpoise.
Really? Guess how many we can see!
It's a beautiful spot this, isn't it?
  We're so lucky, aren't we?
  Complete with seal family.
Totally magic, isn't it? And we've got the weather, it's not raining.
  You know what's going to happen now!
  Wild west Wales!
Charlotte Smith experiencing the changing moods of wild Pembrokeshire.
My Pembrokeshire journey is taking me inland from St Brides Bay.
This is the Western Cleddau which runs through Pembrokeshire into the sea at Milford Haven.
This beautiful river, like many others across England and Wales,
has been at the centre of quite a bit of controversy over the years
over who has access to it.
A nationwide row has been rumbling on for decades between anglers, protecting their fishing waters,
and canoeists, who want free access for all river users.
England and Wales are two of the most difficult places in the world to gain access to inland waterways.
More than 40,000 miles of rivers are closed off to the public.
In Scotland, you can go almost anywhere you like.
But the anglers here say why should canoeists paddle where they want and pay nothing for the privilege?
The two sides have been locked in stalemate for years, but that could be about to change.
The National Assembly for Wales is conducting a public inquiry
to examine how Welsh rivers are used and to make recommendations for the future.
I'm meeting Ashley Charlwood from Canoe Wales on the Western Cleddau in Haverfordwest.
It's an urban setting for a paddle but any further upstream runs the risk of conflict.
Ashley, as a canoeist, why do you think it's important to have free access to all of our waterways?
The waterways in Wales are a fantastic natural resource
and it would be great for the public to be able to use them.
For the public to have responsible access,
we need a new legislative framework so the environment can be protected.
What would you say to the anglers' argument that they have to pay to fish the fish out of the rivers,
so canoeists should pay because they disturb the waterways too?
The argument is that the waterways are currently managed for angling and their recreation.
It would be a bit like asking why a mountain biker
shouldn't pay to use the roadways when a motorcyclist does.
The waterways are managed specifically for recreation and, therefore, a payment is appropriate.
Do you think it would be fair for you to pay a small amount towards river maintenance?
We all pay a lot through our taxes at the moment to grant and aid funding.
If there was a specific action that was managing the water resources for canoeists,
it may be something that's accepted by canoeists in general.
If the results of this national assembly public inquiry are positive,
and it's decided that everybody can use the waterways,
will this end the historical conflict between anglers and other waterway users, do you reckon?
It should start a framework where a dialogue can start to get rid of the conflict.
Anglers are equally passionate and protective over this river,
so I'm heading north along the Cleddau to hear their side of the story.
Good to see you. How are you getting on?
Very well, thank you. Welcome to the Western Cleddau.
Thank you very much. This is a very peaceful stretch of river, isn't it?
It is a very peaceful stretch.
It's owned by the Pembrokeshire Anglers Association.
We acquired it about 13 years ago.
Do you spend many hours on this river fishing?
My good lady would probably say I spend far too much time on this river.
In addition to this stretch, the Pembrokeshire Anglers Association
leases or rents another 12 miles or so of the Western Cleddau.
It's an environment that,
although natural, needs to be managed and looked after.
Fair enough. I've spotted the signs for no kayaking or canoeing. Do the signs work?
We're fortunate in Pembrokeshire in so far that we're surrounded on three sides by the sea.
We've got estuary beds for the Eastern and Western Cleddau,
we've got inland waterways where people can canoe
so therefore, there's more than ample waterway
for anglers, canoeists and other waterway users to enjoy.
We don't have a real issue with canoeists on the Western Cleddau, unlike other rivers.
The fact is, where people are using our facilities, if you like, the fishing that we either own or rent,
we'd like to know who's using it and when.
In return for increased rights of access, the canoeists should have
some form of code of conduct which is clear, concise and enforceable.
The anglers have a closed season to observe,
we pay for our fishing and we invest heavily in the river.
Can I ask you about the right to roam for ramblers?
Do you agree with that or not?
If you're able to roam across the countryside,
why are you not able to enjoy the rivers as well?
It's a very good question. I'd say to you, would you allow anybody and everybody into your home and garden?
The countryside should belong to everyone to enjoy it if it's well regulated. It's different, isn't it?
It's a very good question. If it's well regulated.
However, we have to respect the Law of Property Act and the rights of property owners,
and the people who lease whatever property, whether it be fishing, shooting rights or whatever.
Do you think there will ever come a day when those no canoeing and no kayaking signs will come down?
I'd say to you, at some future point of time, the signs will be there
but probably words will be added to the effect that no canoeing, no kayaking without prior approval.
The number of rivers that are available in Wales are massive.
At the moment, people aren't going there because of the fear
that they may be threatened or feel that they aren't welcome.
If there's going to be conflict, nobody wins. Anybody that wants to enjoy the environment,
there should be some clear, concise code of conduct that's enforceable.
Time will tell if the public inquiry will lead to a public reconciliation.
Access to the countryside is a valuable asset for all ages.
When John Craven visited Pembrokeshire, he joined a group of youngsters enjoying farming life.
This is a most unusual farm.
It's got goats, it's got lots of sheep as you'd expect in Wales,
it's got horses and pigs and chickens.
It's also the most westerly farm in the whole of Wales.
But that's not what makes it unusual.
It's this   children, dozens of them.
Farms for City Children was the brainchild of the children's writer Michael Morpurgo back in the 1970s.
Treginnis Isaf farm is one of three
and this week's visitors are 8 year olds   40 of them   from Wolverhampton.
They're here to live the life of a farmer and they'll do it for a week.
They arrive on a Friday morning and go the following Friday.
They're working   it looks as if it's a 12 hour day, but they have breaks  
doing everything from feeding sheep, feeding pigs, milking goats, looking after horses.
They also come into this garden where they're learning
about how their food is grown. A lot of it they actually eat themselves.
  It not just fair weather farmers?
  I'm afraid not.
Sometimes the rain here is horizontal
and they've got their overclothes and they go out because the animals have got to come first.
As a farmer, what's it like having hundreds of children roaming across your farm every year?
It's a good educational experience.
I learn lots from them, they learn a lot from me.
They also do quite a lot of environmental work.
We've a stock check in the mornings which becomes a nature walk.
This morning, we've seen porpoises and we've seen seals.
We've seen gannets and we've seen cormorants.
We've seen ravens and we've seen a dead lamb.
We don't draw away from it. Life and death are mixed together on the farm.
  So you don't hide things from them?
  No, you can't.
What kind of things have you learnt on the farm?
Before I didn't know how to milk a goat and now I do.
It's just fun and I've never been on a farm before.
I never knew cows could make custard and I never really knew about goat's milk either.
Do you think spending a week on a farm has been a very good thing for you?
Yeah, I'm learning how to wake up early.
Once I get home, I'll be waking up early again, so it'll get me in a routine maybe.
It's quite fun, but it can be tiring sometimes.
Like cleaning out all the poo at the stables.
  It can be quite a smelly job, farm work, can't it?
  Yeah.
The children pay about a third of the cost of their visit.
The rest has to be found by the charity that runs the farms.
This year, about 1,000 youngsters will come here.
We've done lots of work today.
We've been out doing lots and lots of different things.
The children have been out milking the goats, feeding the goats,
  bringing the horses in, grooming the horses.
  Mucking out the horses!
  Definitely.
I've seen them pushing wheelbarrows and wheelbarrows of horse muck.
They think when they first come, "I've got to do that,"
but they soon get into it and work together well and work as a team.
  Is that part of it? The team building?
  Definitely.
It's engaging their learning, putting learning into real experiences for them.
What do we call these?
It begins with an H.
  Herbs.
  Herbs.
Of course, this is hugely different from their circumstances back in Wolverhampton.
Vastly different.
They come right from the city, so the whole environmental atmosphere is completely different.
Some of them haven't even been to the coast or seen the sea before.
Would you encourage any of these children into a career in farming?
I think with the average age of farmers in Britain now at 58,
and food security being an issue, before long, farmers might be valued again.
I think it's a good time to go into farming.
So after spending a week on this farm, who would like to be a farmer when they grow up?
Me!
Almost everybody. Good news for the industry.
John Craven meeting some potential farmers of the future.
I'm in south west Wales. My journey began on the beach at Druidston.
After following the western branch of the River Cleddau,
I've come back to the coast near Milford Haven
and here it becomes a journey back in time.
In 1996, devastation hit the Pembrokeshire coast
when the oil tanker Sea Empress ran aground on rocks and started spilling oil.
A total of 72,000 tons leaked into the sea.
'There is a discharge of oil from the vessel to the south...'
Images of seabirds caked in oil spread across the world as news crews gathered on the shore.
The Sea Empress ran aground here at the entrance to Milford Haven port on Thursday February 15th.
It stayed put, crashing on and off these rocks for the next six days.
A big clean up operation is underway off the Welsh coast
after thousands of tons of oil spilled from a tanker which ran aground.
The Liberian registered vessel, the Sea Empress, got into difficulties
as she approached the entrance to Milford Haven docks.
The oil is threatening some of Britain's most important wildlife habitats.
More than a decade on and the Sea Empress disaster remains a vivid memory in Milford Haven.
Few will remember it so well as harbourmaster Captain Mark Andrews.
On the night the Sea Empress hit the rocks, he found himself leading
a salvage operation that was to change Milford Haven port for ever.
It seemed like a fairly normal standard day.
It was lovely weather.
I'd gone home in the evening and I'd had dinner
when I received a phone call from port control. The words were,
"We've had an incident.
"A vessel by the name of Sea Empress has run aground
"activating the port's emergency plans."
She was leaking oil right at the outset.
The initial phone call said she was leaking oil
and port control had automatically mobilised not only the tugs, but also the oil pollution equipment.
You could see the lights burning down to the west of the ship,
sitting in the bay, with the tugs bustling about to get lines aboard the vessel.
You could see the oil pollution craft were responding as well.
After a few hours, she refloated and came off,
but the bow was down, so the bow was almost under water. So she was too deep to come into the port,
but it was also too risky to take her back out to sea.
We started making arrangements to get smaller ships alongside to take some of the oil off,
to lighten her, in order to bring her into the port.
That was fine for a few days. On Saturday, we received reports of a storm coming in.
'Tonight, the first signs that the rescue operation had run into trouble.
'A strong tide and gale force winds blowing off the land,
shifted the Sea Empress 400 yards down the coast.
'It all happened in minutes.'
So we decided to turn her 180 degrees to meet the weather.
And, during the course of the turn, the anchor cables became crossed and the people on board the ship
decided to let go of the anchor cables and be held just by the tugs.
Within about an hour or so, with the weather coming up,
the tugs started to lose control and the rope started parting.
And we lost control of the vessel at that stage in the bad weather.
Finally, after six days of crisis, the Sea Empress was secured and brought into port.
It was only then that Mark had time to reflect on the drama.
Once the ship was alongside, it enabled me to actually think about things,
because, obviously, you are dealing with an emergency situation,
you are focused very much on the practical issue of getting a ship that is in difficulties
to somewhere where it is safe. Cocooned in a salvage centre,
you are shielded to a certain degree from what is going on because you're focused very much on that.
When you come out of it, it is almost like coming out of the bunker
and you see suddenly the enormity of it. That's when it hit me.
And I remember seeing a photograph of the Sea Empress
with oil streaming out everywhere and all the oil coming ashore at Tenby.
That did make me feel very low.
Indeed, I cried about it because I thought it was
such an awful situation to happen and it was very difficult at that stage.
After the event, everyone here was appalled by the situation
and determined to change things so that it couldn't happen again.
So we have introduced things such as risk assessments, safety management systems, escorting of tankers.
That means that ships come in with a tug attached to them.
We've changed training procedures. We've phased out single hull ships.
And, in my view, my task is to hand over the port to whoever succeeds me
with somebody who is just as interested in preventing a Sea Empress happening as I am,
because the day we forget the Sea Empress will be a bad day for Milford Haven.
Today, Pembrokeshire's beaches are among the cleanest and most beautiful in Britain,
so it looks like the Sea Empress has left no visible stain on the coast. But I want to find out for sure.
Marine conservationist Blaise Bullimore also remembers 1996 like it was yesterday.
It was one of those things that you hope would never happen.
And then, of course, up pops the 9 o'clock News, as it was then, and there it was.
  And what went through your mind?
  "Oh, it's happened."
And just the hope that it was not going to be too bad but...
with the background of the initial reports of the scale of the thing, you did dread the worst.
  And as an environmentalist, that was a nightmare scenario for you.
  It was. Absolutely.
The saving grace was that it was the middle of winter, early February,
and sea birds are still out at sea and not at the breeding colonies,
seals are just dispersing. So, if there is a good time, it is the least bad time, at least.
So is there any lasting damage on the Pembrokeshire coastline?
I don't think so. An awful lot of work was done in the years following the spill,
and probably the longest lasting damage was to lichens,
the colourful, orange and yellow lines and things that you see at the top of the shore.
They were badly burned and they are so slow growing that they take a long time.
A couple of places, they are not right but, for the most part, it is OK.
How long did it take to clear up the main damage?
The main clean up by man was over within six months,
but there was around two years of mopping up around the coast.
The main clean up by the natural environments was in, really, the first few weeks.
But again, that continued for a couple of years.
  How come that was cleared so quickly?
  Two things, really.
The tidal streams here, because it is a big tide
and the tidal streams are very strong and that tended to stir up the water.
But also, this was the biggest dispersement operation
in the history of UK oil pollution and, in fact, worldwide, I think.
It dispersed probably around half of the oil into the water column.
So it gets it away from the surface where it can impact on things
like seabirds and seals, into the water column,
which is not a good thing in itself, but at least it exposes it to the bacteria that can then break it down.
At the end of the day, oil is a natural product.
It is a perfectly natural thing.
There are lots of bugs and bacteria in the sea that can deal with it,
break it down into carbon dioxide and water.
It really is fascinating how nature sets about
dealing with a catastrophe like the oil spill of 1996.
Nature offered the Sea Empress nightmare another saving grace.
Thanks to a change in wind direction, the oil slick avoided
precious sea bird habitats on the islands of Skomer and Skokholm.
When Miriam O'Reilly visited Pembrokeshire,
she headed for the other bird islands of Ramsey and Grassholm.
Morning!
Greg and Lisa Morgan live on Ramsey, but they are also wardens
for the island of Grassholm, a further eight miles out to sea.
It is quite unusual, isn't it, for people to live on an island like this all year round?
It is. It is only in the last three or four years that the wardens
have actually stayed all year round here on Ramsey.
And you're both farmers as well, aren't you?
Well, trainee farmers, I think. Learning very fast.
Certainly, this year we have lambed for the first time in about 10 years.
Has there always been farming on the island?
Yeah, there has been a long tradition of farming on the island.
Since the RSPB bought the island, we carried on the sheep farming side of things.
The reason that we have them is for the benefit of the chuff,
which is the most important bird on the island.
We have seven pairs nesting this year, which is roughly 3% of the Welsh population.
In order to feed, they need access to the soil,
so we need the sheep here in order to keep the grass height down to the suitable level for them.
What other species of birds can be seen on the island?
At this time of the year, in the early spring and right through to
the early summer, we have lots of seabirds on our big western cliffs.
Things like guillemots and razorbills in really big numbers.
But we do need to go right across the island to see them.
Ramsey is just three miles long and a mile wide.
About 5,000 people visit every year.
There is plenty of open space to ramble and birdwatch
along its cliffs. Unfortunately, today, it is hard to see anything.
The birds we are actually listening to at the moment,
as opposed to seeing, are, in the main, the guillemots.
They are packed down there on the ledges in full swing now, in the breeding season.
We're round the back of the island now to get a look at what we couldn't see before due to the mist.
And just above me is a whole line of guillemots. We have seen razorbills as well.
But now we're going to leave Ramsey Island behind and head eight miles
further out to sea, to Grassholm, where there is one of the largest populations of gannets in the world.
It is an experience not to be missed.
Grassholm was bought by the RSPB 60 years ago.
With 22 acres, it is their smallest reserve in Wales
but has one of the biggest gannetries in the world.
I would say
this is an experience not to be missed.
I don't say that very often because, in wildlife terms, Grassholm is a very special place, isn't it?
It certainly is. It's spectacular.
There are 32,000 pairs nesting here. There are well over 60,000 birds.
It is the third largest gannetry in the world.
10% of the world population.
  Why do they come here?
  It is out of the way, it is seven miles offshore, so there are no predators here
and it is a very windy place.
On a day like this it is calm, but there is a lot of wind here
and the birds need wind in order to land and take off.
Where are we in terms of the breeding season with the gannets?
At the moment, most of these birds will be on eggs,
but we should have our first few chicks in the next few days.
The chicks won't actually fledge from Grassholm until late in August, early September.
So it is about three months' before they are ready to leave the island.
It looks very precarious up there. How do they safely make their nests?
They build quite big nests, as you can see. They are quite big structures.
And they add to their nests year on year, so they are bringing in things like seaweed, ideally.
But you can probably see the blue and the orange netting up there.
They do like to bring in plastics, all sorts of bits of fishing netting and plastic carrier bags.
Anything that is attractive to them floating on the water, and they will add that to the nest as well.
We have to come out every autumn to cut free birds that are tangled up on the nests.
These will be the young birds. They are big chicks by them.
They are perfectly able to fledge, apart from the fact that they are tethered on to the nest.
So they are in good condition, they just cannot physically leave the nest.
A lot of visitors come to this island. Do they disturb them at all?
No, I don't think they do. We used to allow people to land on Grassholm until 1997, but the colony has
expanded so massively that we have just stopped people landing to avoid disturbing birds on their nests.
As you can see, it is still a spectacle to actually go around on the boat and, actually,
you get a better view from the boat than you used to from the island.
I don't think I have seen anything quite like this.
It's absolutely phenomenal.
It is one of the wildlife sights of the world.

My journey through Pembrokeshire continues.
With its spectacular coastline and long fishing tradition,
it's no surprise that Pembrokeshire is a great place for seafood.
I want to see how the fruits of the sea get from the sea
to the plate. So I've come to Neyland Marina.
Morning, Liz.
  How are you doing?
  Hop aboard.
  Thank you very much.
  There you go.
Push the opposite way, so if you want to go this way, you push that way.
First things first, it's a trip out into the estuary with fisherman and skipper, Neil Viles.
  Neil, where are we off to?
  We're only fishing in the river today,
today and we are fishing up by the bridge here. Believe it or not,
the tide runs through under the bridge and causes deep holes.
And there are some holes that are 100ft deep.
So I have put some lobster traps here
and we're going to, hopefully, have a few lobsters, etc. Whatever comes up.
So is it mainly lobsters that you catch on this river? Yes.
In the estuary, it is mainly lobsters. A few crab.
Seasons change.
In a minute, we will be catching native oysters and whelks.
I believe it is the second deepest natural harbour in the world.
Neil comes from a long line of fishermen.
Originally from Devon, he moved to South Wales in 1970
to catch shellfish in the rich waters around Milford Haven.
It is a great place to be doing what you're doing. So peaceful.
This is a bit of luxury today because I am not at sea. It is nice in here.
So you usually go further out where it is much rougher, right?
Well, if we did that, you wouldn't like it.
This is the one we're going for, yeah?
How long has it been since you checked that one?
That's about three days. It is about a quarter of a mile long and I think there are 10 traps on it.
And can I help you at all, Neil?
No, that's fine. I've been doing it on my own for a long time.
Right, I will go and pick a buoy up.
It's looking good already.
  There we go.
  Beautiful lobsters in there, Neil.
Yeah, they don't look very big, though.
What we'll do, we will have a look and see what we've got.
  We'll get you to measure it all.
  OK. I am making myself useful on Neil's boat with this handy piece of kit.
It is a South Wales lobster and crab gauge.
It helps us figure out which crabs and lobsters we can keep
and which ones need to go back into the estuary.
It basically measures the width of the carapaces.
This one measures the crabs. If the crab's carapace,
or main body, comes in under
this distance here, we have got to throw it back into the estuary.
If it is bigger, we get to keep it.
The same for the lobster.
With the lobster, you have got to measure the eye socket
to the end of the main body.
Unfortunately, all the lobsters so far have come in well under
this width and we've got to put them back.
And this is also for spider crabs.
A really handy piece of kit and, of course, this helps with sustainability. Very good.
That's way too small.
It's going back in. Bye.
That one looks even smaller.
I would say well under.
From the eye socket... Well under.
Well under. Back in.
There you go. So, unfortunately,
not a lot of good in that one.
Starting to get a bit deeper now.
How's this one looking, Neil?
Little bit of crab, but the lobster's not very good.
Let's measure this.
  He's hanging on.
  Hanging on for dear life.
Yeah, that's just over. That's in.
  Look at that.
  He's a baby.
He's gorgeous, but he's definitely too small. Going back in.
Too small.
A lot of these crabs have their pincers missing.
Yeah, that's where they've been fighting.
'We're hauling plenty of crab, but not much luck on the lobster front.
'The empty pots are piling up too.
'Neil baits each one with an oily fish called horse mackerel, or scad.
'Their oil is carried with the tide, attracting hungry shellfish into the pots.' So more bait? That's right.
  Bait 'em up.
  'Neil's enthusiasm for the job is infectious.'
He's spent 50 years at sea, from big trawlers to tiny fishing boats,
and he never seems to lose the thrill of the catch.
Every pot throws up a new surprise.
  That's better.
  That's looking more like it.
That's way too small. I don't even need to do this to tell you.
That one's more like it.
Could this be the lobster we have for tea? It's bigger.
Look, it's been V notched.
What does that mean?
It's been caught before, paid for and been returned to the sea.
You're not allowed to keep that fish until the V notch has grown out, which is about four years.
  So who paid for it?
  The South Wales Fisheries paid it, but I think it was money from the EEC on a grant.
  So it's to allow lobsters to get bigger?
  That's right.
That was a female, and at some stage I suspect it was full of eggs.
And that's why it was put back in?
Now it's breeding henfish.
Well, I can't argue with that. She's going back in.
We're not doing very well, though.
'Being a fisherman isn't just about the catch.
'A lifetime on the waves has made Neil something of an expert on underwater life'.
Oh!
What have you seen?
  You don't see them very often.
  What?
They mainly come from the Mediterranean.
  It's a triggerfish.
  What?
A triggerfish. You can't push that down, but if you push the back one...
push that one. Now push the back one.
  That is a triggerfish.
  Hello!
  He's going back.
  He is going back. Beautiful!
'Neil used to sell his catch in bulk to foreign buyers in France,
'but his wife, Christine, persuaded him to swap big time fishing for something a bit closer to home.
'These days, they catch, prepare, cook and dress shellfish to sell at a farmers' market in Haverfordwest.
'They've turned food miles into food feet, as all the work is done in a converted garage under their house'.
What's the order for Graham today?
Four dressed crab...
Some whole stuff and a live lobster?
That's right.
If you carry on doing that, I'll do this,
and then we'll put it together and we'll go down together, shall we?
Sounds good to me.
Oh,
there you go, Liz.
  Wow.
  Crab and lobster.
  That is amazing.
  Enjoy that.
  I will. Thank you so much, Neil.
Neil and Christine also supply shellfish to lots of restaurants
around Milford Haven, and this lovely lot is going to be
rustled up into a real feast full of local flavour.
But before that, here's the Country Tracks weather for the week ahead.
I've been on a wild Welsh adventure through Pembrokeshire.
I kicked off with pony trekking on the beach at Druidston, then followed the western
branch of the River Cleddau to Haverfordwest and Wolfscastle.
Heading south again, I explored
the lasting legacy of the Sea Empress disaster at Milford Haven.
Now, after a fishing trip in the estuary, my journey
has come to an end at Neyland Marina.
Milford Haven was once a major fishing port, before the oil tankers
arrived and refineries sprang up around the harbour.
Fishing still goes on, but these days, it's on a much smaller scale.
Earlier, I helped local fisherman Neil Viles bring in his catch on
board the Merry Jess, and worked up quite an appetite along the way.
Pembrokeshire born chef Graham Evans moved back to Wales
from London to open a restaurant overlooking the marina.
Tell you what, I can't think of many better ways to top off
a long journey like mine than with a feast like that.
Amazing local seafood from Pembrokeshire.
What have you prepared so far?
  Looks incredible.
  You've got some freshly prepared cooked crab here.
We've garnished the platter with some nicely sauteed king prawns in chives and fresh garlic.
We've cooked the lobster and split the tail and butterflied it to show the cooked meat.
It's easier to eat, to be honest.
It's better served that way.
Then we've prepared a crab mousse with rocket, lemon, wholegrain mustard and dill as well.
And there's an amazing smell coming out of this pan.
We've got some fresh local mussels, which we've cooked,
rather than in garlic and white wine, which is traditional, we've done it a bit differently with tomato,
red wine and chorizo, with a bit of fresh sweet basil in there as well.
Nice idea, and it smells superb. What's in there?
In here, we've got a lobster cooking. It'll be ready in about five minutes.
We've cooked that in a bit of leeks, some soft herbs, white wine and fish stock.
It really does look incredible. Can I help?
Is there anything else to do?
  Yeah, we're just finishing off our sauce for our lobster which is cooking away.
  Fish stock, lovely.
Little bit of white wine.
  We'll just reduce that down.
  It must be enjoyable to cook right here on the riverfront.
It's fantastic.
I prefer to be out here, rather than in the kitchen.
And do lots of people come from far afield to eat the seafood here? Is that a speciality of yours?
Yeah, on the menu they can see it's all locally sourced, so that's a big seller for us.
Our scallops are pretty much cooked, so we'll add that to our platter.
  That's all they need, isn't it? Just a bit of oil and salt, and that's it?
  Yeah, keep it simple.
Because it tastes so sweet and beautiful on their own.
What's your favourite type of seafood, Graham?
I'm quite a big fan of the old crab.
It's nice and simple.
It goes with anything, and it's quick and easy to prepare.
  Do you fish yourself?
  When I can, yeah.
  Do you ever get the time?
  No, always stuck in the kitchen.
  Is there anything else to do?
Yeah, just finishing off our sauce now for the lobster which is cooking away.
  So I have this here.
  We have some Welsh cured ham which we'll put in.
Got some crabmeat as well.
  Crabmeat sauce, yum. What's this going with?
  Our lobster. Rather than doing a thermidor sauce,
I thought I'd do a twist and do a Welsh way, with the organic Welsh blue cheese, some local crab,
and then the Welsh cured ham as well.
Is this your own recipe, or is this a well known sauce?
  It's fairly well known. Bit of a twist on it.
  I've never had it this way.
Hold on, there's loads of blue cheese left there.
Get that in there. I love blue cheese!
Look at all that.
Nice, much better.
  Thank you very much.
  Just add a bit more cream, just to melt the cheese off.
I can't tell you how good this smells.
That is so good. That is so good.
This is lovely, because it's got the cream and the wine and the hint of blue cheese.
Perfect! Perfect! Absolutely delicious. Well done.
Pembrokeshire conjures up images of towering cliffs
and sandy beaches, but I like to think my journey has revealed much more than just postcard views.
I've met the people who make a living from
its rich resources, and explored the legacy of a disastrous event
which shaped this region's history.
Pembrokeshire mixes gentle beauty
with a raw and rugged charm, kind of like drinking wine in wellies.
