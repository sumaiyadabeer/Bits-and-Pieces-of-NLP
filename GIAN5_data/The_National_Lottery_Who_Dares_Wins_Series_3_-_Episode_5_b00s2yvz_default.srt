Previously on Who Dares Wins, psychology student Cassy and civil
servant Clint teamed up for the first time to take on the reigning
champions. Ian Fleming is not on the list. Yes! One away from taking
the game. I think we're going to roll with it. Going to roll with it.
You're going to roll with it. Cassy and Clint... I can't take it.
You're the new champions! You're one correct answer from £50,000.

Ladies and gentlemen, please Hello and welcome to the National
Lottery Who Dares Wins, the show where completing a series of lists
can make you very rich. On Who Dares Wins we put together teams of
complete strangers and ask them to fill in missing answers on a list.
For example, if I asked you to name Tom Jones' UK Top 40 hits, how many
could you list? You might say It's Not Unusual or Sex Bomb. But what
about Release Me? Is that on the list? That's what Who Dares Wins is
all about. On this show, if you dare to bid more than your
opponents and then deliver the right answers, you can win
thousands of pounds. And not only that, but if you keep on winning,
you can keep on playing. And two people who know all about that are
our current reigning champions, Cassy and Clint, who last week won
£50,000. Tonight they are back to see if they can add to their prize
fund. Please welcome Cassy and You have still got enormous grins
ear to ear, you've been wearing them all week, I should imagine.
£50,000, have you decided what you're going to spend it on? Yes, I
am going to go and visit my grandma, who lives in North Carolina. I
haven't seen her since I was about six years old, cos the flights are
pretty expensive, so I have decided to do that. How fantastic is that?
You were off to make an emotional phone call the last time I saw you.
It was emotional. Was it? Family over the moon, are they?
through to my daughter, she burst out crying, the whole family
started crying. It is life changing, isn't it? Tell everyone what it was
that you were going to do with the money. Firstly the wife says I have
got to spend a little bit buying a car, because the other one has
broken down. But the main first thing is to take her to Venice,
Orient Express, renew our marriage vows. Wonderful. You're reigning
champions   can you take it any further? Definitely. Definitely.
We've got much more confidence now. We're chilled. So you're not going
to be knocked off your perch? no, not easily. We are here for
weeks. You're here for weeks! Smashing. Champions, please make
Before Cassy and Clint can have another crack at Who Dares Wins,
they will have to beat some new challengers. Please welcome
Hello, John. Hello, Margaret. You need to get to know each other very
quickly and form a very solid partnership, despite never having
met each other before today. Absolutely not, no. OK, let's find
out a little bit more about you. Margaret, you're a pub landlady, is
that right? Yes, for 10 years we had a pub in Devon. Great to start
with, lots and lots of fun, but the money soon dwindled away, as it
does. If you won some money, what would you use it for? I've got a
lovely daughter who has presented me with five fantastic
grandchildren. And my husband, who unfortunately is not with me any
more, he died a couple of years ago, and he promised them that if they
wanted to go to uni, he would pay the fees. And I want to keep that
promise, so that's the major part of any money I won, to go into a
fund for that. Good luck, that's a very good reason. John, what do you
do for a living? I'm a graphic designer, I work on magazines,
design layout, photographs, that sort of thing. I'm trying to start
a career as a stand up comic. Really? Yes. That's tough. Very
tough, yeah, I've done it about five times now, to varying levels
of laughter. Go on, then, be funny. I might as well, hadn'tI?
Absolutely. Two oranges walk into a bar. One turns to the other and
I've got to ask you, because the champions made a lot of money last
week, and now they are determined to hang on and have another go. So
are you guys able to knock them off their perch? I think we will give
them a good run for their money, don't you? Definitely, they've won
enough already. It's time to... Yeah, let them go home, yes.
that right? Yes. Challengers, please make your way to your
OK, the teams are in their pods. When the pods turn red, like so,
they are completely soundproof. They can't hear anything that I or
their opponents are saying. They will only be able to hear what's
happening when I turn their pods on and they turn blue. In a moment I'm
going to give the teams a list. Whichever team bids more will get
to play. If they win their target they win the list   if they fail,
their opponents win. The first to win two lists gets to play for
£50,000. Teams, if you're ready, Eddie Murphy films. We are looking
for any feature length, theatrically released film in which
Eddie Murphy has made a credited appearance, voiced a character or
contributed a voice over, including animated films and documentaries.
This is according to the Internet Movie Database Pro website, and is
up to April 2009. I'm not going to tell you how many answers there are
on that list. That's for you to work out. Challengers, you get to
start the bidding, which means champions, I'm going to turn your
pod red. So, what do we think, Eddie Murphy films? Pretty
confident about that. It's a bad one for me, but my partner sounds
confident, so I'm going to leave it all up to him. I think I can
definitely do 13. I think so. Am I totally on my own on this one?
are totally on your own. I can do 13. I've got great faith in you.
Thank you. 13. Thank you. They've opened with a bid of 13. He was
looking confident, that young man over there. You're the psychology
student, Cassy, what do you think? I'm trying to analyse the behaviour
and the facial expressions, but I'm not sure right now. Something about
meeting the... I think I'm up to nine or ten by myself. Bid 14, then.
Yes. We're bidding 14. Thank you, champions. 14. Erm, do you think I
can do 15? D'you believe in me? you think you can do 15? Yes. Yes.
I've got every faith in you. If you say you can do it, I believe you.
Yes. 15, bring it. Thank you. 15... I think we let them do it. I'm not
too confident now. Let's just think for a moment. Clint, I'm not
confident, I really don't want to play. I'm sorry. I think we let
them play. Hold on, just bear with me, just give me a moment or two,
just think... Clint, are we going to fall out here? I think we should
let them play, honestly, please, I don't think we are confident enough.
If you lose this for us... It's not my speciality subject. Think about
Eddie Murphy films, what films he's been in. OK, up to you, then. It's
in your hands, I have already said how I feel, it's in your hands now.
I know, but I'm only playing... 16. 16? Trust me. OK, I'm trusting him.
You don't look very happy about it. 16 is your bid, yeah? Yes. Thank
you. 16. If I go up to 16, it just means we've got 17... Any more up
there? I think 17. You want to go for it? OK, all right. Yeah, I
think I can give it some more. Thank you. 17... We've had a
discussion. Do you know what? I had a feeling that whilst the pod was
off, you might have had a free and frank exchange of ideas. I was
allowed... A punch up. I was allowed to go to 16 on the proviso
really that if they outbid us, we let them go for it. So? We'll say
name it. We're going to say to them, you're going to get it wrong, name
it. Thank you very much, champions. Challengers, we have a decision,
they have said name them. Oh! it's time to play the first list on
Margaret, John, although I have a feeling it is going to be mostly
John... I think it is. Give us your first film title. Beverly Hills Cop.
Yes, it's there. Why not Beverly Hills Cop II? Your second correct
answer. Beverly Hills Cop III. third correct answer. Let's go with
the Shrek films. Shrek. Correct. Shrek II. Answer number five, well
done. Shrek III. Is correct. we'll go with Nutty Professor.
Nutty Professor, it's there. We'll go with the sequel, which was
called The Nutty Professor The Klumps. Is correct. He was also in
Dr Dolittle. Gets you over half way. And I believe there was a Dr
Dolittle II. Have you seen that one, Margaret? I haven't seen any of
these. He's doing well for you, he's into double figures. He's a
lovely lad, isn't he? I'm very pleased with him. OK, erm, he was
recently in a film called Meet Dave. Meet Dave? If Meet Dave is on the
list, you will be six away. If it's not, you will have tripped up, and
given the list to the champions. How are we feeling? We've done all
the easy ones. You've done all the easy ones? This is where it gets
hard. This is where it gets hard. OK. Next answer? A while back he
was in a film called Coming To America. Coming To America...is on
the list. OK, more recently, he was in a film called Norbit. That gets
you to number 13. Only four films required now. He was also in a film
called Bowfinger. Have you seen it? No, but I'm pretty sure he was in
it. You're correct. Three needed. He was in a film called Boomerang.
It's all coming back to your, isn't it? It is. It's on the list. Two
titles required. I've got three. One is a long title that I am not
so sure about. One was a stand up show called Raw, which I'm not 100%
sure was released theatrically, but I'm pretty sure it was. And then
the other one is something called Harlem Nights. And I'm pretty sure
he was in all of those, but... He was definitely in Raw, so I think
we need to go with that. We'll go with Raw. You're saying Raw? If
it's there, you will be one away from taking the first list off the
champions. If it isn't, you have handed the first list to the
champions. I can tell you Eddie Murphy...was in Raw. You're one
away. One film title. OK, so it all hangs on this one. He was
definitely in a film which I think wasn't very good, or very popular,
and it was something about Pluto Nash. I think it was The Adventures
Of Pluto Nash, but that's quite a long title. And then he was in
something like Harlem Nights. Those are the two, I think maybe the
Pluto Nash one. It's just getting the title exactly right. I'm going
to have to pick one, aren't I? Let's go for The Adventures Of
Pluto Nash. OK. Come on, there must be something else old! I'm having
second thoughts. I think we've got to go with it, my mind has gone
blank apart from those. The Adventures Of Pluto Nash.
Adventures Of Pluto Nash. If it's there, you've won the list, and you
go 1 0 up. If it's not, you've given the first list to the
champions. You could have said Harlem Nights. You could have said
Trading Places. Of course! No! in the end you went for The
Adventures Of Pluto Nash. It's been a brilliant performance up till now.
He's done you proud, you've won the Will you be my grandson, can I
adopt you as a grandson? Yes, you can. I was unsure about than last
one. Eddie Murphy fans might like to take a look at the other answers
that you could have given. There's a few there, but it didn't matter,
you did really well, and got to the 17, which puts you in the box seat.
You only need to win one more list and then you're going through to
play for the £50,000. Champions, you're behind now, you need to win
a list, otherwise you're going out. We do. No worries. Bring it on.
let's find out what the next list is going to be. The second list
To clarify, we are looking for any commercial airline that operates
from Heathrow. This is according to the official BAA Heathrow website.
Please note, we will accept names by which an airline is commonly
known. This is up to 8th April 2009. Champions, you get to start the
bidding this time around. Champions, you need this one, don't you?
we've got to go for this one or we've lost. So I think we appear
confident. We'll maybe start at about eight. I could probably name
three, and that's it, I know nothing about airlines. We've got
to do this one otherwise we're out, so... How many can you name? Name
them for me now. Erm... I think either way we've got to be
confident, so if you want to go six to eight, it's up to you. That's a
namby pamby number. Either go a bit higher, to scare them, or right
down... OK. My tactic is to go low, see what they want to do. No, but
that shows that we don't know any, which is just... Not necessarily.
This partnership that worked so well last week appears to be
falling out. I know. Er... Let's go nine. But you don't know any!
don't know any at eight and I don't know any at nine. So it doesn't
matter. We're going eight, then. I'm taking control this time, Nick,
we're going eight, please. Eight, thank you. Challengers   opening
bid from the champions at eight. What do you think? We're pretty
confident on this one, yes, so what do you think, go nine? Yeah, OK,
let's go one more, yeah. Just nine. Thank you. Champions, they say nine.
We'll go 10, then. Hold on a second. Let me shake my head and pretend
that I don't know for a moment. Good tactics! Erm, I think we...
I'm quite happy to go 10, but I'm pretending to be exasperated, so,
yes, 10. We're going to go 10, Nick, please. And the Oscar for
overacting goes to... So your bid is 10, yes? Yes! Thank you,
champions. They say 10. Erm, I think... I think they are desperate
to do this one. I think they want to take it, but we're confident,
we'll go 11? Yes. 11. Thank you. 11. I don't think that was a long
decision. 12. I think they're pushing us. I think it's easy to
make a mistake on, much more easy than the last round. Yeah. Shall we
let them play? Let them play, yes. We're going to let them play.
them? Yes, name them. Champions, you're in play, they say name them.
You wanted it, did you? Yeah, we wanted it. She can do it! OK, it's
time to play the second list on Who Give us the first answer. What are
your thoughts? Cos I know a few... British Airways. Does British
Airways definitely fly from Heathrow? It must do, it's British
Airways. OK. Oh, what about Virgin Atlantic? Yeah, go on, Virgin
Atlantic. Virgin Atlantic. You're saying Virgin Atlantic for your
opening answer. Yes. Virgin Atlantic is on the list. OK, the
next one we are going to go for is KLM. Gets you two correct answers.
Thank you. The next one we are going to go for is North West
Airlines. Your third correct answer, well done. Thank you. The next one
we are going to go for... Can I ask you why you're not going with Fly
Emirates? If you're happy with Fly Emirates. Do you follow football?
You've got to have some contribution. No, I don't follow
football. They sponsor Arsenal. do they fly from Heathrow? I don't
know, it's a worldwide... Well then that's not relevant, is it?
They're one of the biggest airlines in the world. OK, we're going with
Fly Emirates. You're saying Fly Emirates. If Fly Emirates is on the
list, it will be your fourth correct answer. If it's not on the
list, you've lost the list, and the game, and your crown as champions.
Cassy, Clint, I can tell you that Fly Emirates... Is not on the list.
Margaret and John, you're the new Cassy, Clint, just to explain to
you, Fly Emirates is not the name of the airline, nor is it commonly
known as that. The advertising slogan is called Fly Emirates. But
the airline itself is actually Emirates. And we have to make it
accurate in that respect. Let's have a look at the other ones you
You must be very, very disappointed, cos you're only leaving with
£50,000. Yeah, we didn't want to be selfish, we're going to let
Margaret and John have a go. You've been great champions, albeit brief.
Ladies and gentlemen, Cassy and Clint! Margaret and John, you are
our new champions, and now you're playing for £50,000 on Who Dares
So, Margaret and John, you have defeated the champions and you now
have the chance to win yourselves a lot of money. Let's look at exactly
how much you could earn on tonight's first money list. It
could be up to £50,000. That's what you're aiming at, and that's just
for starters, because on Who Dares Wins, if you keep winning, you can
keep coming back and earning. How do you win? I'm going to give you a
list, and you must fill in the gaps. Give me three missing answers and
you will get £5,000. Six answers, I will give you £10,000. Nine answers,
you're looking at £15,000. 12 And here's where it gets really
interesting   give me all 15 answers and you will bank
yourselves a cool £50,000. But, and it's a very big but, be very
careful, make a mistake at any point, it's game over and you drop
right back down to zero. So, are you ready? Yes. Yes. Then let's
To clarify, we are looking for any act that has had five or more UK
number one hit singles between 1952 and April 2009. This is according
to the official charts company. Immediate reaction, good list or
bad list for you? I think between us it will be a good list. I will
do the old ones, he can do the new ones. Sounds good to me. Well,
let's get started, because you risk nothing by heading off towards
£5,000. So I need a first act from you. The obvious ones to me are
Elvis and Cliff. Yes. They must have done. Elvis Presley. Elvis
Presley...is on the list. Of course he is. Go for Cliff Richard?
think Cliff Richard is a banker, yes. Cliff Richard. Cliff Richard.
Can Cliff Richard get you closer to that £5,000? Yes, he can. Yes, he
can, you're answering for me. OK, the third answer, for £5,000...
Obviously, yes. Yes? We'd like to go with the Beatles, please.
Beatles? Yes. They've just won you There you go, that's a good start,
up to £5,000. Are you pressing on to £10,000? We'd like to play on,
please. Yes, please. You're going for the £10,000? Yes, please.
fourth answer... Spice Girls, definitely. Yes. Spice Girls?
Girls. Are your fourth correct answer. Yes! Westlife, definitely.
Westlife? Westlife, please. Have Westlife had five or more? Yes,
they have. Yes! So, here we go   what is your sixth answer, for
£10,000? We'd like to go with Take That. Are you a fan? Massive fan.
Mark Owen, here's my fave. Gary Barlow is mine. Are you a big fan?
I like Gary Barlow. You will like them all if they are there on the
list, won't you? Oh, yeah, we'll love them. I can tell you, Margaret
and John   Take That... Are now Yes! £10,000   £5,000 each. Do you
want to press on towards £15,000? Elton John probably hasn't because
he didn't have a number one for a very, very long time. I would have
thought the Stones had. Frank Sinatra? I'm going back to '52 here.
I don't know. I'm kind of tempted to leave... Are you? Happy to have
the five grand? Five grand, and we will come back and play. I think
it's too easy to slip up on. Yes, no, I'm happy with that. So you
don't fancy going on? To be certain that three more acts that have all
had five number ones, it's tricky. There's several that I think
probably have... But we're not 100% certain, and 10 grand is a lot of
money to lose. We don't want to risk that, so we'd like to take the
money? Yes. We'd like to take the Just as a point of interest, I
think John, next time you might want to pick Margaret up rather
than the other way around. Sorry, I got too excited. Well, look, you
had some other ideas as well, didn't you? Let's have a couple
that you thought. I reckoned the Stones. Elton John... The Stones
were on there. Yeah. Elton John was not on there. Was he not? Oh, wow!
Frank Sinatra... I said Frank Sinatra. ..was not on there.
Shows you, doesn't it? Let's have a look at all of the other ones that
you could have had. Hey, look, you did the right thing to stop because
you now have £10,000, and it doesn't have to end there, because
of course, on Who Dares Wins, as long as you keep winning, you can
keep on earning. All you have to do is beat another set of challengers
to get another crack at a new money list and another £50,000. Champions,
congratulations, please return to Next, a brand new set of
challengers, please welcome Laide Lovely to meet you. Hello. Make
friends, you need to make friends quick because you could make each
other a lot of money here. So, Laide, let's start with you. What
do you do for a living? I'm a business law student. So you're
studying to be a lawyer? Yes, I am, I want to do that to make some
money. Cos there's money in it, then I want to own my own boutique,
open my own line, be a designer or a stylist. Really? Yes. That's very
cool. So, this cash will come in quite handy for that. Definitely.
Let's find out a bit about you. What do you do for a living? I'm a
director of human resources in the education sector. And if you won
some money here, what would you spend it on? It would be to go back
to Brazil. I spent the first two years of my life in Brazil. You're
Brazilian? No, I'm not Brazilian! I was conceived in Brazil but I was
born in Belfast. OK. But my parents were in Brazil, did a little bit of
jiggy jiggy. Yeah, well, I... I know what conceived is, obviously.
And then Mum flew home and had me in Belfast, and then we flew back
out again when I was four months old. Right, so, the big question is,
can you remove the champions, can you get to the cash? I believe so.
Yes. Very much so. Confident. right, well, contenders, thank you
very much. Good luck, make your way So, team, if you're ready, the
We are looking for any independent European country that has a
coastline on the sea or ocean. This is according to Britannica online.
Please note, the Britannica definition of Europe includes the
countries bordering the north and west of the Black Sea, but not
those that border the east and south. Challengers, you get to
start the bidding. So what are we thinking? Is this a good subject?
Yes, absolutely. Yes, I'm thinking... So what are we going to
go for? I'm thinking maybe we should go for eight. Yes, I think
that sounds reasonable, absolutely. OK, we'll go for eight. Eight,

Scandinavia? You're only three away from taking this first list. Do you
think you should have done more? We're going to see. We're going to
see. You still think they might trip up? They might do.
champions, next answer. Sweden. Sweden takes you two away. Denmark.
It's there. Just one more to take this first list. Yeah, happy with
that. You can say this one. We're going to go with Finland. Finland?
Yes. Margaret and John   you've There were actually quite a few.
Let's take a look at the overall list, and the other countries that
you could have had. But it didn't matter because you got the number
that you required to take the first list. You only need one more list
and you're back to have another go at the money. Challengers, you need
the next list to force a tie break. Yes, definitely. The second list
This is according to the data bank on the official Star Wars website.
Please note, we will accept the names as they are commonly referred
to in the films. Champions, you get to start the bidding this time.
What do you think, start with eight? So, are we liking this?
I'm a big Star Wars fan. We are quite happy about this. Did you
watch the Star Wars movies? Oh, I watched them religiously.
haven't, have you? It's down to me again. It is down to you, you feel
you know this one, do you, John? Yes. I think I can... And so the
eight bid is what? I don't think they know any, so... Why don't you
think they will know any? I just don't think it's their sort of
thing. They're a bit highbrow, aren't they? Very clever ladies,
but... Are you suggesting that your partner is lowbrow? No, no, no, not
at all. No, I am, that's fine, very lowbrow. Well, we'll find out,
thank you very much. I'll be back to you in a moment. The champions
have opened the bidding at eight. think they will make us name it if
we go for nine. Yes, if we go to nine... I think they will make us
name it, because really, we can't name nine, let's be honest with
ourselves. Yes, we can't, but, yes... I can only name about four
or five. Yes. So what are you saying, you're going to try and
bluff them, or go and make them name it? No, I think we're going to
have to call them. Yes, we should? I think so. Let's do it. So you're
going to make them name eight? And hope they make a mistake?
We are. All right, thank you very much. Margaret, John, they say name
them. Oo! Oo! It's time to play the second list on Who Dares Wins. OK,

road from you? Keith Prowse. David Prowse. We'll go with Darth Vader,

with Obi Wan Kenobi, please. Absolutely. OK, all the robots next.
R2 D2. You're now three correct answers away. I love him, I love
him! I'll go C 3PO next. C 3PO is on the list, you need to get only
two to take the lead. You sort of knew this was going to happen,
didn't you? Yes, it was out of her hands. I thought you might just
bluff them up a bit to try and get them up. But they would have said
name them, and I could only name about three or four. That's what I
thought. If they had said 10, would you have said name them? If they
had said nine I would have said name them. Just to watch them
squirm. There you go. So, let's have your seventh answer. We'll go
with Jaba The Hut next. You are now one away from taking the second
list. That's my boy. That's my boy. Will your new grandson have a
correct answer to take this list? I'm sure he will. We'd like to go
with Boba Fett. Boba Fett? If Boba Fett is there, you've taken the
second list, and the game. If it's not, we are heading for a tie break.
You could have said Jawa, Chewbacca... Chewbacca! I knew that
one! Or even Han Solo. But you went for Boba Fett. Margaret and John...

To clarify, we are looking for the names of male tennis players who
have topped the world senior professional rankings in singles
tennis since computerised records began in August 1973, up to the end
of April 2009. This is according to the official rankings list on the
Association of Tennis Professionals website. Please note we are looking
for surnames only. Right, immediate reactions, tennis? Not a big fan.
Not brilliant. No. No. Shall we head off towards £5,000, because
you lose nothing by setting off, yes? Absolutely, yeah. Give me a
big name. Federer? Federer. Federer. He should be there, shouldn't he?
And he is. Pete Sampras. Yes, Pete Sampras. Just surname. Sampras.
Your second correct answer. One more and you've won £5,000. Agassi
has got to be a cert, hasn't he? Agassi... I think Greg Rusedski was
number one at some point. I know he never won, but... Agassi, you
think? Yes, Agassi. Agassi. You're saying Agassi. If he's there,
£5,000 is yours. If he is not, you haven't won anything on this list.
Margaret, John... You've just won So, can you think of another three
big names that you feel fit the list? Borg, Bjorn Borg? Was that
before 1973, though? Oh, gosh. Boris Becker. John McEnroe...
Becker? Yes, Becker is a cert, surely. Becker was kind of 1980s,
wasn't it? McEnroe... McEnroe. Shall we go with one of those two?
Yes. OK. You're going on to £10,000? Yes, please. OK. So, I now
require a fourth answer from you. Yes, we think Becker. Becker.
has got to be there. Becker. Yes. Is on the list. Yes! Shall we go
with McEnroe? Yes, McEnroe has got to be on it. And then spend a long
time deciding about number six? we'll have a good chat about the
next one! All right, we'll go McEnroe, then. You're saying
McEnroe as your fifth answer. Was he a male number one tennis player
between 1973 and 2009? Yes, he was. Yes, he was. One more correct
answer and you have won £10,000. Lleyton Hewitt. Greg Rusedski I'm
pretty sure was number one at some point. Yeah? Yeah. I seem to
remember... I always remember him losing everything. He did lose a
lot but I seem to remember some show, BBC Sports Personality Of The
Year, he won that, I think he was number one at the time. He did win
that, I would have known that. think maybe that's what he won.
What was that other one you just said? Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt...
Lleyton Hewitt. I'm happy with Hewitt. I'm quite happy with Hewitt.
Lleyton Hewitt? He's definitely won Wimbledon, I know that. Yes. He was
a bit of a rookie, though, did he come from nowhere? Yeah, I don't
think he... I'm pretty certain about Rusedski. OK, do it. Are you
sure? Want to go with that? Yes, no, I'll go with you, yeah. OK, our
answer is Rusedski. Rusedski? If Rusedski is there, you've got
£10,000. If he is not, you've just lost £5,000. Margaret. John. He's
not on the list. Never mind. . Greg Rusedski was British
Number One for a while and his highest world ranking was World
Number Four. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Let's have a look at some of the
people you went through. You said Bjorn Borg. He was on the list. You
said Lleyton Hewitt. He was on the list. Rafael Nadal was on the list.
Unfortunately you didn't win anything this time round but your
total prize fund still stands at £10,000. That's yours no matter
what else happens. And it doesn't have to end there because you are
champions. And on Who Dares Wins as long as you keep winning you can
keep on earning. All you have to do is beat some more contenders to
have a crack at it. But they have still got £10,000, ladies and

your luck is in. It's time to cross over to Lottery HQ for tonight's
