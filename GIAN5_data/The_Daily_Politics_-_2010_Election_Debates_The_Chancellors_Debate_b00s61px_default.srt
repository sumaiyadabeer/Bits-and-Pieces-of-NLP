11.30am. Join us then if you can. Which of these three men do you
want to be Britain's next Welcome to the Daily Politics
Chancellors' Debate. I'm Andrew Neil. The UK has just endured its
worst recession since the Second World War and, with the recovery
still fragile, there will be no more defining issue than the state
of Britain's economy. Today, three men, one of whom is Chancellor now,
and the other two who could be Chancellor in a little over two
weeks' time, go head to head. Vince Cable is the Lib Dem Treasury
Spokesman, Alistair Darling is the current Labour Chancellor and
BBC's economics editor, Stephanie Flanders to help keep them honest.
We will be hearing from our would  be Chancellors in a moment. First,
here is a reminder of what is at stake.
This election takes place with one area of policy dominating all
others   the economy. The "credit crunch" put the entire banking
system under threat and sent Britain into its deepest recession
since the Second World War. Borrowing rocketed from £35 billion
a year in 2007 08, to £167 billion a year in 2009/10. The Bank of
England had to slash interest rates to 0.5% and pump £200 billion into
the economy through quantitative easing to stop the economy
nosediving even more. The question that has dominated British politics
ever since is how liable was the Government for the problems the
economy faced? Well, we as a nation, underprepared for hard times with
the public too prone to high spending and a Government that
should have done more to fix the economy in the good times. Or was
the "credit crunch" an unforeseeable event, unprecedented
mortgage crisis in America? Moving forward, who has the best plan to
get the economy growing again? Who will be honest about the taxes that
may have to rise and the spending that will have to be cut if we are
to tackle the deficit? The next 45    in the next 45 minutes, you
decide which of the parties has the best policy for the economy. Before
we came on air, our politicians drew lots to decide the order in
which they will make their pitches. Vince Cable picked the number one
ball, so Vince Cable please take your position and make your case.
This morning, we were reminded of the human costs of this economic
crisis, 2.5 million unemployed and rising. The question is what do we
do about it? The banks have to lend to businesses who can create growth
and employment. We also need a levy on the banks. It's supported by the
IMF yesterday. Secondly, we need to sort out the public finances. We
need public expenditure discipline, and we have been specific about how
this should happen. Third, we need stpair taxes. People    fair taxes.
People of low and middle income should have cuts in income tax.
Vince Cable, does it bother you that you are no longer on the
front page of your party's website? You used to be the Lib Dem poster
boy? Not at all. Nick Clegg and I work very well as a team. He
clearly impressed the country in his debate. I have done my job
supporting him. I'm his Deputy. We have a good costed programme. We
are proud of what we are advocating. We are working together as a very
good time. Thank you very much. Time to hear from Alistair Darling.
Please present your case. confident about our country's
future. Yes, we have been through one of the deepest downturns this
country and other countries across the world has seen in generations.
But our first task is to secure the recovery. Take away support too
soon, cut away that support would put at risk jobs, it would put at
risk if recovery. Next we have to get our borrowing down, but we have
to do that in a way that enables us to protect frontline services like
schools, like hospitals, like police. Thirdly, and absolutely key,
is how do we get the economy growing again? It is growth that
will bring jobs and jobs will bring prosperity and security for
families in this country. I believe that provided we stick to the
course we have set, we will see this through, we will make sure
that we get growth and that this country can look forward to a
bright and optimistic future. you. You talk about growth. Do you
mind that in terms of economic growth you will go down in history
as the worst Chancellor since the Second World War? I know that we
have been through a very, very difficult time. We have not seen a
downturn like this in generations. I hope that what people will
realise is that the decisions that we took, I took as Chancellor, over
the last couple of years or so have meant that our economy is now
returning to growth, it is a fragile growth and as I said, it
will be a big mistake to take away that support prematurely. Provided
we do that, we can both get growth and therefore jobs and begin to get
our borrowing down on a sensible basis that doesn't damage the
economic fabric of the country. Do that, we can be confident about the
future. Thank you. Time now to hear from the Shadow Chancellor, George
Osborne. Today, unemployment rose by 43,000. And a record number of
people are not looking for work in this country. The British economy
is failing the British people. And the question for myself and for
Alastair and Vince is how are we going to get Britain working. I
believe and the Conservatives believe that five more years of the
debt and the waste and the taxes that got us into this mess is not
going to get us out. We need action and change. We need change so we
deal with our deficit and deal with our debt. We need to stop Labour's
jobs tax which the vast majority now of the high street employers of
this country think would kill the recovery. We also need a more
balanced economy so we are not hitching our entire fortunes on to
the back of the City of London. I believe we need a Government with a
clear mandate to deal with these problems, not a hung parliament
where no one is in control, which would lead to economic paralysis.
We need a Conservative Government to get the economy moving. Thank
you, George Osborne. Why do you think a recent poll showed a clear
majority of City and business leaders would prefer Ken Clarke to
be standing there rather than you? I don't know what poll you are
referring to... The City AM poll of over 1,000 leaders in the City?
There was a poll a few days ago that shows the investors who invest
almost £2 trillion in this economy believe that the economic policies
put forward by myself, David Cameron, Ken Clarke and the whole
Conservative Party are the right ones for Britain, that a re elected
Labour Government would cause serious economic problems for
Britain so the people who are putting their money where their
mouth are want a Conservative Government with a working majority
to get the British economy moving again. Thank you for that. So, our
would be Chancellors have set out their priorities. Now it is time
for Stephanie Flanders and myself to cross examine them. Alistair
Darling, people are still losing their job, inflation is still
rising and growth remains fragile at best. Why is this economy in
still such a mess? Growth is fragile. Partly because we have
come through the deepest downturn that we have seen in generations,
partly because we have had an acute crisis in the banking sector in
different parts of the world. Today's unemployment figures show
one thing very clearly to me   we were absolutely right to take steps
to support people, to get people back into work. If you take away
that support now, as the Tories are suggesting, that puts at risk more
people losing their jobs and more people being out of work for longer.
It is the Government's duty to ensure we get as many people back
into work as possible, we make sure we get our economy growing because
that is the way you will get jobs in the future. I believe that in a
position we are in just now, where we are coming through this, we are
seeing modest growth, but it is fragile, the last thing you want to
do is to be taking money out of the economy at this stage. It really
would be to present a terrible risk not just to the economy but to
individuals' jobs. George Osborne, do you agree with Ken Clarke, sorry
to mention it for a second time, that if we get a hung parliament,
the economy is so fragile that we will have to call in the
International Monetary Fund. Isn't that scaremongering? If markets
feel we don't have the confidence to deal with our debts, we would
have to call the IMF in, that is a statement of fact. It is also a
statement of fact that the only time in post war British history
that we have had to turn to help from organisations like the IMF is
when we had a hung parliament, when we had a very weak Government and
we had a Government unable to command the confidence of the
British people. We have got to be aware in this country of the
consequences of political instability, of not having a
decisive outcome from this election and what that could mean for
economic confidence in the UK. Vince Cable, last time we had a
Lib Lab pact, we had to bring in the IMF. If you bail out the
Government again, we will bring in the IMF? No, the idea that that
outcome produces the disaster that George Osborne is describing, is
scaremongering of the worst kind. They are losing the election and
they are starting to panic. Sterling was lower a year ago when
you were 10% ahead in the opinion polls. If we do have a major
financial emergency in this country in future, the public will expect
the parties to work together. All of us. That is why we have been
suggesting this idea, the Council for financial stability, where we
agree on what has to happen in relation to the deficit, in
relation to how you co ordinate this with monetary policy and bank
regulation. You are smiling, Chancellor? You know, what we heard
from Ken Clarke today, and George just now, is pretty desperate stuff.
What really does destabilise markets is where you make promises
that you can't afford to pay for. I think your biggest problem is you
have made promises to cut taxes amounting to £38 billion, you have
no credible plan to pay for them, that is what makes markets roll
their eyes and wonder what is going on. Frankly, Ken Clarke ought to
know better. I don't think there is a gaffe, or he thought through what
he was going to say, this is a ridiculous statement to make. What
is wrong with your approach is, you have made all sorts of promises,
you have thrown caution to the wind, that is what destabilises markets,
that is what makes people think we have had a look at the Tories and
we don't like what we are looking at. Ken Clarke was a damn more
successful Chancellor than you were. I trust his economic judgment more
than I trust yours. Second, Nick Clegg was talking about Greek style
social unrest just a couple of weeks ago. Was that scaremongering?
If you were elected with a third... Is that scaremongering? Let me
finish. If you were elected with a third of the vote, one in five
voters, and you tried to ram through public spending cuts, which
you have not explained, there would be severe resistance. There would
be riots on the street, is that right? It would be extremely
difficult to carry through... is what your leader was saying.
Look at these two parties having a go at each other. This isn't very
complex. What markets want, what people want is a plan to make sure
we secure our recovery, we get our borrowing down but we do it in a
way that doesn't damage frontline services and we get growth because
that is where growth will come from. Let's take on this major claim that
you made at the start of this programme which is that the
Conservatives are going to put the recovery at risk by taking money
out of the economy. You say this in the knowledge that your taking more
than £20 billion, not £6 7 billion that the Conservatives were
proposing, more than £20 billion out of the economy this year by
putting VAT back up. We are the only major G20 country to be doing
that. Why does that not put the economy at risk but another £6
billion would? The stimulus measures we put in place, I made it
quite clear at that time these were temporary to bring forward
expenditure to make sure that we avoided going into recession. To
answer your question directly, to take out £6 billion and it would be
a quarter of the way through the financial year, I believe would
damage the economy. It is not just my view, it is the view of many
economists who take the view that, at a time like this, when recovery
is fragile, to take that money out at the moment would put at risk the
recovery. Especially when it is clear that confidence in the
private sector   and I do not think taking that risk now could possibly
justify especially... You know that £6 billion is not   you revised
this year's borrowing figure by more than £6 billion, so you know
that that is not   it is a rounding error. Is it really the case that
this would put the recovery at risk? It either does matter, as
George would say, or it doesn't matter as you would say. I think it
does make a difference. I think public expenditure over the last
couple of years or so has made the difference between our economy
coming through things now and starting to grow and tipping into a
deeper recession. This is a £1.5 trillion economy. Are you saying
that the recovery is so fragile that £6 billion would make the
difference? What I am saying is... Is that what you are saying? If you
look at the totality of public expenditure, it is making a
difference to our economy. It is keeping people in work. Today's
figures show that this is a task that is by no means complete. We
need to do more to help people get into work. If you start taking
money out of the economy now, before we have got growth properly
entrenched, you run a risk. We do not need a Government that is
prepared, that is ready to take risks that are unacceptable. Yes,
next year, you will get stronger growth then. That is the time when
you start making reductions in your borrowing. You used to be an
economist. Do you seriously argue that £6 billion would make a
difference one way or the other to No I wouldn't but I would argue
for... You wouldn't. I would argue for broad fiscal neutrality. On
this issue of timing it is right in the coming financial year. What
does it mean in English? Not having a severe contraction of the Budget
deficit. 6 billion isn't severe. That is joo that's what I'm saying
what would be unwise is a severe fiscal constraction in the current
year. What the Tories is saying is... This is what Alistair is not
spelling out. There are cuts going through in the name of efficiency
savings, and we can see this in science and education. We believe
what has to happen is spelling out to the public what the cuts are.
that point, Alistair Darling, 18 months ago, you announced cuts in
spending of £5 billion for this financial year. At the time you
said it was tough but necessary, isn't that what George Osborne and
the Conservatives are saying? things. Firstly three years ago we
announced a programme to take £30 billion out of    through
efficiencies, doing things better, the money is recycled into the
economy. I then increased that by a further £5 billion because I do
think that   and this is an important, I suppose argument
between the three of us   I do think if you can be more efficient
you should be more efficient. But my whole argument, right since 2008
is you needed that public expenditure in the economy. Now
it's not just my view, there's many economists, the IMF, OECD they
agree supporting the economy through this recession, until we
get growth, has been an essential part of recovery. The next stage
you have to reach is of course how do you make sure you have got
growth in the future? How do you get the jobs in the future? How do
you make Britain excel again in many areas, where already we have a
good reputation? George Osborne, what happened to
the age of osterity. Did it fall at the first focus group? No I
continue to make the observation I make today that the Government ran
out of money. The public finances were so badly managed particularly
over the good years and the institute of fiscal studies has
produced a good report on that, it was badly managed that we have the
largest budget deficit of any major economy in the world. That meant
whoever wins the election faces very difficult public expenditure
decisions. Are you still promising an age of osterity? I'm hoping for
an age of prosperity. At the Tories party conference you promised an
age of osterity, are you still promising...? I was making an
observation about the world in which Alistair Darling and Gordon
Brown had left Britain. So are we in an age of osterity? Well we face
very os tier choices on the public finances. We are. This is a
consequence. Why are you frightened to use that phrase again? I'm not.
Well use it. I was describing the situation that we find ourselves,
in after 13 years of a Labour Government, after all those boom
years where they setting in aside for a rainy day, that we are even
having this discussion about the state of the public finances.
didn't say that. At your party conference you said we are entering
an age of osterity ufrplt backed off it as it went down badly.
not taking any advice on political positions from a Labour politician
at the moment. I will say this, you wrecked the public finances and in
particular, bur your boss, Gordon Brown, wrecked them when he had
every chance of putting money aside and almost alone in the world we
did so little during that decade. That's not right. The Institute for
Fiscal Studies said we were the only country in the OECD... Don't
part quote. They did say we reduced the debt level. It was the second
lowest in the largest countries, we got public finances into proper
order. Are we in an age of osterity We are, I wish we would get to that
point. It was primarily caused by the collapse of the banking system
and recession that followed. We have to deal with. It the
Government has taken the costs of this big disaster on its own books
and we have to pay for. It the issue, partly a question of when,
which is what we are debating, the question of how and what we have
been trying to do is spell out specifically some of the cuts that
have to be made. But you are right there is an age of osterity.
think you have a question for the shadow Chancellor.
You have made having a credible plan for the markets on borrowing,
central. This isn't about what Alistair Darling has done, it is
about what you will do in the future. I want to know what is your
tart for Government borrowing, as a share of the economy at the end of
the next Parliament   what is your target for Government borrowing?
I'm not going to set a target today. I want to do what the governor of
the Bank of England advices us to do, which is to eliminate a bulk of
the structural deficit over the come Parliament. I think that is
right. He is the person in charge of monetary policy in this country.
I believe that's the correct judgment and it is the judgment we
will pursue. Alistair Darling, his plans would show the structural
deficit falling by two thirds. Is that the bulk?. When he made the
comments the gorveor the bank came before the House of Commons and
said we need to eliminate the bulk. What is the bulk? I'm not going to
design when I don't have the formal advice of the governor of the bank
in private conversation. You don't need the numbers for this. I don't
have your Treasury Civil Service formally advising. I will not set
some target for five years' time. I will follow the advice of the
governor of the Bank of England, who publicly made it clear he
wasn't satisfied with your fiscal judgment, Alistair.
What does bulk men? It seems bizarre you are resting your whole
strategy on the definition of the word "bulk." We can have
discussions about whether it is or is not the bulk? Is it more or less
than two thirds? I have the few that monetary and fiscal policy
should be co ordinated. It is clear that the money authority believes
we should do more. Is it more than a two thirds reduction? Why do you
need to talk to the governor of the Bank of England? We will start
sooner than you, and that's clear. And we will eliminate the bulk...
What is the bulk? The governor of the Bank of England, the person you
put in charge of monetary policy has made it clear he was not
satisfied with your fiscal plan, thought we needed to go further. I
agree. The governor of the Bank of England is in charge with monetary
policy, not fiscal, you should be making that decision. You talk
about the markets. Let's be clear, the markets believe the most
credible Government we can have is a Conservative Government with a
working majority that is able to deal with these problems. If we
want investment and confidence in this country, we don't want our
credit rating downgraded which Alistair has criminally put at risk,
then we need a Government with the mandate to get things done. OK, we
were looking for a definition of "bulk", let's move on. Vince Cable,
you claim, your party's and your posture is   we are more honest
about the accounts. The fact is you have done no more detail of cuts
than either of the two party there is still a £30 billion hole and you
are nowhere the level required. Be honest and tell us where the other
£30 billion is coming from? I will explain. We start with the changes
that have already been made. There have been tax increases. We have
suggested is £15 billion   we produced detailed costs, of which
£10 billion should go towards reducing the deficit. We accept the
premise of your question that more has to be done. There is a second
wave of cuts. They are in areas like public sector pensions which
require more work and consensus. And defence cut which need a review.
So clearly there is more to be done. None of your defence cuts, as you
have admitted in another programme, would come in this side of 2015?
Specified one, the Eurofighter 3B. Although you don't know the
penalties on the contract? Work joo working with the publicly available
information we believe there are savings, we know the company which
has a vested interest in producing it... So it saves awe couple of
billion. In the interests of honesty, give us the other £28
billion I will give you the £25 billion. I'm looking for the black
hole. I don't know how you get £28? We are halfing the deficit, so we
are talking £35. Of which £20 is already in place. We are talking
about how you get the other £15 £20. We have identified ten, net and are
talking about further cuts. I have said there are areas like public
sector pensions we haven't tried to quantified. There are defence cuts
which we are not putting a figure on. In our £15, we have been much
more specific than anybody else. You made so much of honesty. I'm
struck by this, you say   we have identified £so billion, more than
the other parties, but you look at it, about half is double counting.
It is things that the Government is already doing. You have £3 billion
you will get from your public sector pay deal which you admit it
is an tl terntive to the Government's plans, they are
already planning to get £3.4 billion. That's one third of the
£10 billion gone. How is that honest when they are not additional
cuts? When I talk about the £20 billion base we are operating on, I
was talking about the tax changes the Government has introduced.
said £10 billion net. Pay is on top of that and we recognise ours is an
alternative approach. Where does the hole come from? It saves £3
billion on top of what is already done. It wouldn't save £3 billion.
It is a difference. Chancellor, you have already proposed a 1% pay
freeze. That's right. Since Vince wants George and me on his council
of whatever it is, both of us would like to know this   you said in the
Chancellors' debate a couple of weeks ago that you thought child
benefit shouldn't be paid to some people. I want to know the limit
above which you wouldn't get it and you also said you want to cut back
the availability of tax credits for families? I would like to know the
limit above which you would start it seat cutbacks? What we have
suggested on child tax credits. Is that high ownerers, we are talking
about £50,000, shouldn't get one element. To save the money you have
identified you would have to come lower than, that maybe below
£30,000. No there would be a tapering. It would hit people.
There would be significant savings. And significant cuts.
People earning less than £50,000 would lose some credit as well.
freely acknowledge that. Can I support Alistair here, the truth is
this, Alistair and me are under enormous scrutiny. And in that
television debate you said child benefit would be cut, unless I
misheard you. It was a misquotation, I was talking about child tax
credits and that's what I was discussing.
You have previously come up with ideas on child benefit. I'm not
suggesting cuts in child benefit. But since you make the point that
you are under pressure to produs numbers, why are we the only people
who have produced detailed numbers in terms of cuts? You are talking
about generality. As it happened this week I received a little from
Chris who ran the anti  aindividualance group at HMRC
between 2004 9 and he says this about your plans, "The ideas that
the tax savings of the sized promised by Nick Clegg are
achefable is to my mind very doubtful and really does not stand
up to close scrutiny." It is an extraordinary comment. And he his
savings are likely to produce less tax than Nick Clegg Liberal
Democrats' arrive. This has also been sent to a newspaper. This is a
man who ran the anti avoidance group. We are talking about £5
billion of his plans. The official estimate of the Inland Revenue
itself, including this gentleman, was that £40 billion of taxes are
being avoided and evaded. We are suggesting saving one tenth of that
in terms of very specific measures, relating to stamp duty, to the way
company tax is aindividualed through a complex scheme organised
by banks    is avoided. And in terms of national insurance in kind,
things like private health insurance. What happens if you
didn't get them? You will have spent the money? What would happen
is that there are other elements in the tax package that the Institute
of Fiscal Studies have acknowledged where we have understated the
revenue we would probably get. Let's move on to capital gains tax.
You are honest, Vince Cable, some people refer to you as St Vince
Cable. Soo Not me. I understand that, nor your wife. So far you
have produced the most dishonest poster of the campaign, you have
criticised the Tories for secretly increasing VAT, yet you have
refused to rule it out, which is all the Tories do as well. That's
not the new politics. Well we don't rule it out, that's quite true.
Neither do that they. The specific person of that illustration was it
take an issue which the Conservatives have made a variety
of tax prom iss, notably in relation to NICs and inheritance
tax, the 2 million inheritance tax cut. There was no indication of how
this was going to be paid for. We said on the basis of their previous
history, their preferred form of increasing taxes under the last
Conservative Party was value added tax. You didn't say "might" or
"could", you said "will" is going to happen.
Now you are saying it is a might or a could. Well you might increase it
or Mr Darling might increase it, if he is still Chancellor. It was a
perfectly legitimate debating point to make the point that if they
haven't costed their own tax accounts and haven't got any ways
of funding it, that that they would resort to the measures they have
used in the past. When you talk about debating point, you seem to
be quite opportunistic. You have a great reputation for being honest
but at the start of this campaign you said the increase in national
insurance was schoolboy economics, you thought it was nauseating, that
the businessmen were come out against it. I can defend both.
you produce a manifesto that says you too would like it withdraw the
national insurance rise. We have not committed ourselves. You have
said in the manifesto you would like.
I will quote it you said, you would like to reverse, it "When resources
allow we would seek to reverse it." That's the nauseating schoolboy
No. That was what we called schoolboy economics. It is quite
right to say that the National Insurance increase is not a good
tax. It does increase taxes on payrolls. In an ideal world, it
wouldn't have happened and you reverse these taxes. Any voter
listening to you would think, "They are supporting the Government on
this." A week later, "Hang on, they are not supporting the Government."
It is unclear to get your position? You have read the extract quite
correctly. It is not a desirable tax increase, but there are funds
to reverse it so we accept the Government's increases as a matter 
of fact. Is there a reason why he is able to produce a poster like
that and it resonates is because your party has previous on this,
you doubled VAT to 15%, you then added another 2.5% to it. When we
look at your figures, the easiest way for you to give us what the
bulk of the structure of deficit should be is a rise in VAT? I think
we have got to do the difficult work, which is dealing with public
expenditure. I am clear that the way we have to deal with this is by
primarily looking at public expenditure. The guide I take is
one that's been produced by international bodies   indeed the
Treasury have produced a report   which says 80% of the work should
come from ex pen dichur restraint, 20% from tax in   ex pen ditkhur
restraint, 20% from tax increases     80% of the work should come from
expenditure restraint. I remember Michael Heseltine had no plans to
stand against Margaret Thatcher? When I became the Shadow Chancellor
in 2005, almost the first question, probably from you, was a question
about whether I was going to rule out tax increases. I said I can't
and no one can do that. I will do everything I can to make sure that
we get the effort done through public expenditure restraint and
that I am pretty confident that we have got the plans to do that. That
is why I say we have got no plans to increase VAT. Your emphasis on
the deficit, which you talked about for about a year, seems to have
gone by the way. Apparently, every day you announce another tax cut
without being clear about how it will be paid for. That is so untrue.
So far you have £30 billion worth of promises being made. You may not
like my plans, but I do have a plan for halving the deficit in a four 
year period. Over 100 of the leading employers in Britain think
it's a bad plan. Over 1,000 small businesses today have come out   so
I don't deny you have put forward some proposals. They will kill jobs
and kill the recovery. David Cameron said that of the national
increase postponement, he did not have the money to pay for that over
a five year period. Have you thought up where to get the money
since then? You are putting words in David Cameron's mouth. I heard
it on the Today programme. We are using the advice of Martin Reed who
you turned to for advice, that we can find deficiency savings this
year and in the subsequent years, because you start on a lower public
expenditure baseline, and that means we can avoid this job   when
are you going to listen to Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's, Boots,
Mothercare? Stephanie Flanders? Can you think of a tax rise...
public are still listening to this argument... I'm interested in what
you think about taxes. Are there any tax rises that don't cost jobs?
Which would you prefer if you don't like National Insurance rises?
a low tax Conservative who would like to be able to reduce taxes.
I'm well aware of the current situation. We have lots of Labour
taxs in the pipeline, some of which have just come in like the 50p tax
rate for top earners. For me, the priority was to avoid the tax rises
on the many, not the tax rises on the few. Partly for reasons of
equity and therefore I'm not able to make a commitment on the 50% tax
rate for example. All right. If you are going to cut public spending,
you think that doesn't cost jobs? That will be tens of thousands of
jobs lost? The challenge is the one that Alistair has left us with,
which is this massive deficit. Of course, under   all of us   there
is going to be a lower head count in the public sector. If you are
looking... Job losses? If you are looking at taxes, surely an
employment tax, a jobs tax is the thing that you would reach first to
avoid? Alistair Darling, you have not ruled it out either. But you
promised in the last Labour manifesto not to raise income tax  
you broke that promise. You have also used National Insurance rises
as a form of income tax. You have pushed thousands of ordinary
middle income taxpayers, school teachers and so on, into the top
band of tax by failing to increase the allowance in line with
inflation. Why should anyone trust you on tax? The promises we made on
tax are the promises we made in the last three elections. You broke
them? In relation to the top rate of income tax, yes I had to do that
because frankly given the need to get our borrowing down, had I not
brought in that measure, I think people would have said, "Why are
you delaying doing something, especially when the people
concerned have done fairly well over the last few years?" It brings
in a couple of billion, Chancellor. There are other ways you could have
done it. The fact is, it does bring in money. For anybody, for 99% of
people watching this programme, it is the same as a rise in income tax,
so you broke your word a second time? In relation to National
Insurance, I remember it because I was asked about this in 2005, I
said that no Chancellor or indeed Shadow Chancellor would rule out
changing every single aspect of the tax system. We have had to raise
taxes, especially for people on the top... And ordinary people with
National Insurance? We have also made it clear we will have to take
some difficult decisions in relation to public spending. The
key thing is this. All of us are agreed that our borrowing having
risen, we have to get it down over a four year period. I have set out
a plan to halve that borrowing over a four year period. What is clear
from the exchange over the last 45  minutes is that his plans are
incredible and his are starting to unravel. People, no one wants to
put taxes up. What they do want is a determined Government that is
going to get the borrowing back down, but do it in a way that
doesn't damage the fabric of our economy or society. I mean, as we
all know, economists disagree on a lot of things. There is one thing
that they agree on and that all the academic evidence agrees on, is if
you have to cut borrowing, you should do it by cutting spending
and not by raising taxes, it is more costly to the economy to raise
taxes. Why are you then still planning to raise taxes by £16
billion if you are so worried about the economy? You have to strike the
right balance. Remember, public spending, yes it will have to take
its share, but public spending also has some value, investment in
transport infrastructure for example, in our education system,
universities, that will make a difference to our performance as a
country over the next 20 years. A lot of what we ought to be debating
in this election is how do we see our country in that 10 to 20 year
period? What action can we take to make sure we can rebuild our
economy, get a balanced economy, so it is not all just financial
services. That is the key issue. Vince Cable, you have dined out on
a reputation for honesty and been more foreseen in this economic
crisis than Mr Darling and Mr Osborne. In October 2008, you said
it was entirely wrong for the Government to stimulate the economy
with more public spending, four months later you said the
Government was right to stimulate it. You describe quantitative
easing printing of money as the Robert Mugabe School of Economics,
you later supported it. You supported the Lloyds TSB takeover
of HBOS, then you claimed it was being dragged down by HBOS.
Isn't the biggest myth of this election your reputation? Certainly
isn't a myth on the points you have mentioned. One of them, the Lloyds 
HBOS takeover, I genuinely changed my mind having seen the evidence.
What about Robert Mugabe? That was not a change in view. I don't know
if you read the article. The point I was trying to make, which was a
sensible one, if you resort to the deliberate creation of money,
quantitative easing, it has dangers. You do support the policy? I do.
Why would you call it Robert Mugabe if you support the policy? A
country with inflation of 1,000%? If you read the article... I have
read the article, as you know. I have interviewed you on this
before? To illustrate what would happen if it was not properly
managed. Stephanie Flanders? If you look back, we have given you
credit for warning about rising debt levels and I can certainly say
you were giving speeches about that in the last few years. You weren't
warning about sub prime. It is fair to say looking back you didn't have
a single major proposal for dealing with that, did you? It was all talk,
wasn't it? No, it wasn't all talk. In relation to credit expansion,
and what was happening in the banking system, I argued from the
year 2000 that the recommendations of the Cruickshank report, which
were about tighter regulations of the banks, should have been
followed through because they were making excess profits. I argued
specifically that the demutualisation of building
societies should have been stopped. It was. You had no concrete
proposals for cutting the rise in personal debt? I did, I
specifically argued that asset prices, housing, should be included
in measures of inflation so the bubble would have anticipated. I
argued for much tighter regulation of mortgage lending. I specifically,
the Liberal Democrats followed through with me on this, that we
had specific policies to deal with the problems we had raised. We are
a few seconds away from your final statements. Alistair Darling, since
many people say regardless of the outcome to have the election, you
won't be Chancellor, could you take this opportunity to admit once and
for all so we don't have to ask this question again, that it was a
mistake to have claimed to have ended "boom and bust"? Correct?
There is always going to be economic cycles. I would say that
when Gordon Brown was Chancellor, we had the longest period of
uninterrupted growth this country... He shouldn't have said no more
"boom and bust"? We were trying to eradicate the problems we had in
this country over successive governments. Ten years of stability
is not bad to start. We have a job of work to do. OK. Time for our
three parties to make their final pitches. From where they are and in
no more than 30 seconds as to why they should be Chancellor. It is in
reverse order so George Osborne, please begin. You have heard the
arguments. Alistair Darling offers more of the same from a Government
that has failed the British people and unemployment is still rising.
So the choice is between a hung Parliament, which would mean
economic paralysis and risk pushing this country back into recession,
or a Conservative Government with the ideas, the energy, the vision
to get the British economy moving, to get the British economy working
for everyone and that is a choice that the British people are going
to have to take in two weeks' time. Thank you. Alistair Darling?
have listened to each of us set out our stall. I think Vince's
arguments today are frankly flaky. George's are incredible. I remain
as I said at the start of this programme optimistic, confident
about the future of our country, provided we stick to the course we
have set, we can see this through, get jobs, prosperity returning and
I think this country has a lot to be proud of. There is a lot we can
do together, provided we don't take risks. Thank you. Vince Cable?
steps are these. We have to get the economy going, job creation, that
public spending discipline, that means cuts, and we are spelling out
what those are and we have to have fair taxation. A lot of people like
what the Liberal Democrats have to say. They should vote for us and if
they vote for Liberal Democrats, they will get Liberal Democrats.
Thank you very much. That is all from our debate today. My thanks to
Vince Cable, Alistair Darling and George Osborne. These special Daily
Politics Cabinet Debates will be back on Monday at 2.15pm when we
