Sometime tonight, the Greek financial crisis will be settled
and Europe will live happily ever after. Or so we're asked to believe.
But even if finance ministers do strike a deal to let Greece borrow
more money, are the people of the country willing to suffer for the
sake of foreign banks? And will they accept European commissars on
the ground dictating day to day policy as some in Northern Europe
want..We'll hear from a Greek cabinet minister. And how did
Greece get itself into this mess? Step forward Goldman Sachs, the
bank that helped to make the books look balanced. And the European
officials who like to say yes. wrote to deck Tate letter to
Eurostat. Six months later, we got a letter back, saying they veted
and we better shut up. Here the coalition wrangles of the budget s
the new tension in Government how far to penalise the wealthy to
protect the less wealthy. ambition is to end the period of
austerity in terms of the incomes of low and middle income families.
Our new political editor is here. That language from David Laws man
who was the first Chief Secretary to the Treasury in this Government,
and is still a big noise in the Lib Dems is illuminating because
austerity isn't something the Government likes to boast about.
And our borders. It is all right the Greek financial crisis will
soon be over, that's what officials close to the negotiations going on
in Brussels tonight say. Accept of course it won't be over, the Greeks
will merely have succeeded in borrowing billions more to try to
pay off billions they've already borrowed while the northern
Europeans who got to pay the bill will have got some conditions they
attached they believe they can sell to their people. The dux Finance
Minister, for example wants a team of commissars installed in Athens
to make sure the Greeks stick to the rules. First up Joe Lynam
denial. Forever many Greeks this week will trigger a decade of
economic stress and collapse in their living standards.
Their fate was sealed 2,000 piles away in Brussels, where eurozone
finance ministers arrived to get a special pleading from the Greek
Prime Minister himself. Lucas Papademos argued that Greece had
met all that was asked of his people, and was entitle today a
further 130 billion euros in loans and guarantees. His audience seemed
more responsive than they were a week ago.
Greece has made very important efforts but we need to
continue the work now and all parties need to provide their
contribution. The IMF is part of it and working on it.
It is the intention of nobody to have Greece outside the Euro area,
this would be a big solution for reason. It would be nonetheless but
situation for the Euro area. Then came the Dutch finance Prime
Minister pouring cold water. He wants to see the troika, based full
time in Athens, something which will make the southern Europeans
lived. I am, myself, I am in favour of a permanent troika, in Athens.
That's my personal position, yes. I think permanent   when you look at
the derailment in Greece, which has occurred several times now, it is
probably necessary that, some kind of permanent presence of the troika
in Athens, not every three months but on a permanent basis. I'm in
fave of it that. The comments is schism between the north and south
of Europe is real and won't be papered over by warm words. They
feel they've been misled by Greek politicians in the past so Cher'
exactly a stiff price from ordinary citizens. In a second bail out
worth 130 billion euros, Greece has cut tenses of jobs and public
sector pensions. Going forward, they agreed to have every key state
asset and get used to troika's hot breath over their shoulders, to see
they don't deviate. Is it workable? Austerity, won't work, and we've
been going down the path for the past few years. We've seen
depression level contractions in Greece, and without any economic
relief, that is some growth, I don't think you can expect a
country such as Greece, to itchment reforms, structural reforms that it
needs to do in order to become sustainable, a sustainable member
of the eurozone. With youth unemployment at 50% and
increasingly angry Greek youth could make any deal signed
unimplementable on the ground. we're moving into is a crisis of
democracy. Because the Euro as a currency is public good for the
citizens of the eurozone. But the decisions taken to the safety of
eurozone are taken by individual countries, and might impose,
undemocratic, and to a large extent unacceptable constraints on other
eurozone countries. This week the Greek Parliament is set to activate
a collective action clause, to force all bond holders to take a
compulsory hair cut or right down of 70%. The international swaps and
derivatives association will decide whether a Greek bail out is in fact
a messy default or an awe dor of to a Lehman Brothers moment.
Joe Lynam is with us in the studio now. Is there going to be a deal
tonight? They're talking, eight hours after they started. That
means they haven't got the deal they had hoped. They're going to be
talking about the monitoring I was referring to there, the
surveillance where the hot breath of the troika, the IMF and ECB will
be breatheing down on Greek officials and ministers so they
don't stray off the path. They're talking about the account in which
they will pay the money. It is like giving someone a ï¿½0 note with a
chain attached to it, because the Greeks won't have access to the
money, because the troika will be controlling that account. And even
at the end of all that, all they'll have succeeded in doing is
borrowing money against imminent rainy day, which will have to be
paid off at some point? Will have to be paid, all going for the Greek,
all going well they will get the debt down to 120GDP, that's
unsustainable by any measure, that's if the economy recovering.
It shrank by 7%, that's a depression not recession. For that
who happened, there needs to be private sector investment. The rich
people are squirrelling their money away out of the country, so the
private sector led recovery, will be a tough one. Why has the mood
changed so much snx the mood from north to south has changed, the
Germans, and Dutch and Finns, to vote on the bail out deal, may not
approve it, saying, we have been lied to by Greek politicians, we
don't want to be lieed again, it is moly the triple A rated countries
will put their money on the line. Thank you very much. Now the Greek
crisis is not an zept T has human causes. On the one side is the mess
Sianic on the political class, and the elass it can view of what
constitutes sound Government and good management of the economy. The
country's adited to borrowing. Yet, was commit after joining the Euro
to cutity debt. How is it to do so? It didn't. It turned instead to one
of the world's biggest investment banks, for help in getting around
the deficit rules. It was nick Nick Dunbar, author of "The Devil's
Derivatives", how Goldman Sachs did Greece a big favour. For the first
time, some of those who did the deal talk publicly.
The sales, it is a sexy story, between two singers, but the
European crisis is not the child of the sex we had.
With Goldman Sachs. Perhaps as an electorate we might have agreed
this is what we want to, it was nef we were nef consulted and we nef
knew. Greece is teetering on the brink. Poor man of the eurozone,
dependent on the EU for bail out loans, mistrusted by creditors and
poised to default. How did it bring itself to the edge and how did 2.8
billion euros of debt disappear in the wind? In 2003, I exposed
Greece's attempt with Goldman Sachs to conceal the size of its debt. At
that time the Greek authority say I was making something out of nothing.
So now I'm back in Athens, to understand how and why the deal was
done. What was the deal's cost to Greece, at a profit to Goldman and
why were EU watchdogs insistent they knew nothing until 2010? In
2001, in a wrestle how to qualify for Euro membership, the Government
argued how they could kick the habit of debt. Greece had to
promise to show directionability, the debt ratio had to go down every
year. With events like the 2004 Olympics coming up, that wouldn't
be easy. For the civil servants, an easier solution of at hand., why
not hide the borrowing instead? Among the banksers who flocked to
and theen, was head of fixed income sales at Goldman Sachs. In 2001,
she came to the table with one of the most important deals of her
career. She had found a way to give the Greeks what they were looking
for, a way of shrinking their debt that was legal and completely
secret. I'm going to meet the man tasked by the Government at the
time with getting Greece ago debt moving in the right direction. The
deal involves swaps, bets to hedge risks. He says from the start he
wasn't able to disclose the deal to the market. If you go to the open
market, as a secret agent trying to sell bonds, you make allowances
because you want to attract investors. When you do it is as a
bilateral deal, you don't make announcements about it. No one did
it at that time. If you look around Europe, nobody announces the swaps
they did with every counter party. And that was the tradition.
swap that Goldman offered Greece would shrink the debt, use ago
foreign exchange transaction. In the same way you or I convert our
currency when we come back from holiday, international brotherers
convert the foreign bonds into domestic debt. Goldman used a
fictitious exchange rate to make the country's debt appear smaller.
In this way, 2.8 billion euros, suddenly disappeared, giving the
false impression that Greece was convergeing with the Maastricht
rules. The debt hadn't really disappeared. In reality, Goldman
had secretly lent Greece, 2.8 billion your euros as part of the
swap. In an attempt to paying it back with big interest interest
rate delts, there was further debt. A year after the Government
chaickds. The new Government revealed the spiralling costs of
the Goldman deal. The dretrimental swap
agreement, led to the debt. The swap agreement had a direct cost of
500 million euros, and indirect cost of one billion euros. The new
boss of Greece's public debt management agency, says the deal
ostensibly achieved what the previous Government set out to do.
They hid the debt, so they were in agreement, with requirement to be a
member of the eurozone, right. But the cost was huge. And when finally
they had to come out in the open and acknowledge this debt, this
debt ballooned. But big debt? big debt. A bad bet? In prospect
yes. Vul of the bets not working out,
the loan mushroomed to 5.1 billion, Goldman involved tweaks to ensure
the dice was loaded against Greece and in favour of Goldman who were
making millions from the deal. asked Goldman to eliminate this
feature that was not usual on the market. They refused to. I
recommended to write a letter high up to, get rid of this, without any
come pen says. But they were asked they couldn't do that, because the
traders were in position, and they may lose money. He sympathises with
the position his predecessor was in? He was riped off by Goldman. I
don't blame him. Because, he was scared and could not go to the
market and check, and was asked by the Government to do that.
might wonder how such a deal could be allowed, but it was legal.
Goldman wanted to be sure, it wouldn't get into trouble for
helping the Greek with such a bear  faced trick, so the company said it
spoke to the EU accounting agency about the deal, and provided
Newsnight, that discusses took place. We asked Eurostat but they
For many, questions remain. Why wasn't Eurostat looking out for
Greece in the interest of the Euro in the whole. The deal was well
known. How could Eurostat stay bliss flee unaware until 2010?
Greeks were trying to warn about the dodgy stat in their own
country? In 2005, we wrote a detailed letter to Eurostat, dobing
in your Government at the time. For, what they were doing in fiddling
the Greek's statistics. Three months later, we say they
investigated everything and it was above board, so we better shut up.
The billions oweed upped the Goldman swap is a small piece of
the 350 billion euros, that Greece owes today, only a fraction that
will ever be repaid. That 5.7 billion simpliess the sip tenseives
for Greeks to fiddle debt, and banks to cook up deals, and
Brussels institution toss look the other way. If, you put me back to
2001, would you do that again, I would say, no not because of the
economics behind it, probably design it a little bit differently,
if I knew that September 2011 would happen, but I would never do the
type of business because of the political handling and risks of
this deal afterwards. Newsnight approached Goldman Sachs but they
declined. In a statement they told In and thes today, the legacy of
Utopian financial experiment is unstable angry society, reeling
from four years of recession, with no end in sight. The Greeks, who
itchmented and analyseed these transactions, agree it was a toxic
import that played on the weakness,s a sub prime in the US
bankers played on the weak necessarys. The Euro failed the
Greeks. Greece is poise today default on the debt and leave the
eurozone. Germany and EU institutions expressed outrage how
the Greeks cheated their way to disaster. That's hypocrisy. Back in
2003, the story of how legalised financial trickery was roting the
eurozone from the inside wasn't something the guardians of the Euro
want to hear, so they ignored it. It is tempting to ask, whether a
single currency, held together with such toxic glue is actually worth
saving. Well, joining us now from Athens, is Giorgos Papaconstantinou,
until the middle of last year, he was Greece as financial minister,
now he is minister for the environment. And also with us, is
John Redwood. Mr Giorgos Papaconstantinou, forgive me, I'm
so sorry, when you look at that inkoch tense, it is not surprising
the northern Europeans want to keep a very close eye on how you get
access to any further loans? I can see how the Goldman Sachs story is
sexy as your video says. But I don't think it is justice to what
is happening in Brussels tonight which is a bigger picture. A few
points, point number one, everybody was doing it. Every country in the
eurozone was using these kinds of tricks to reduce their debt back
then. The difference with Greece is when the rules changeed in 2008,
the same Finance Minister you had in the video, saying how terrible
it was, forgot to declare it with Eurostat. To pack maick it
absolutely clear, this was after the entry in the eurozone, so it
had no effect for the rules of us entering. And the debt of 160% of
GDP, those% the Goldman Sachs swap was about, is important but it is
not the story. The story is about overspending, and receiving less
than the taxes that were due to the state. Over years and years, this
is where we're at. We will come to tonight in a moment or two. First
on the Goldman Sachs story, you used to work in the banking world,
what do you make of it? I'm not surprised that Goldman Sachs went
off and came up with a clever scheme, which rewarded them as well,
because that was the brief they were given. An alleged 600 million
Euros. But the mainvilleens in the story are the sponsoring Government
that want to do this kind of thing and lost the money, and the
European authority who seem to connive at it. Nobody was saying it
was illegal, it was Legal Business, and they got the reduction of debt
for the period of time they want. What do you make the European
authority signed off on it? It is quite wrong, but we know, as we've
been hearing from Greece, a lot of countries, massageed or arrangeed
their figures to get in the Euro and some carried on doing so
afterwards to conform with the sensible rules. We know it was
because, most countries ignoreed the rules and got into the Euro,
when their figures was way out of order, that we have the crisis
we're now facing. There is a big question, these people ought to be
answering, why did they turn their backs on it, they must have known
what was going on, both the "euroland" people and the national
state Government have access to great financial and legal advice,
so it is difficult to believe they didn't know what Goldman Sachs was
doing. So they turned a blind eye. Mr Papaconstantinou, let talk about
tonight and what's going to happen. One more point on the previous
story. It is important to remember, the two countries that breached the
Maastricht criteria were France and Germany. When Eurostat asked for
audit powers to be able to know exactly what's going on in the
various countries, the cubs that did the not give them audit powers
from the large countries, against France and Germany. And yauro stat
only got audit powers after the Greeks statistical mess came to
light, after we came claep   the new Government at the time, what
the you in numbers were. This is a telling story, of the failings.
Everybody was up to no good in one form or another. Let's turn to
tonight, are you confident there will be a deal? I think there will
be a deal. My understanding is as we speak, the differences are
narrowing, it is a question of getting the projection of the debt
in 2020 to be around 120%, which the European council decided and
the assurance that is will make the finance ministers of the eurozone
members comfortable for the new package for Greece. It is an
important decision. Because it can turn the page for Greece. It can
stabilise the rest of the eurozone. And we can move forward. Do you
think it will turn the page as we've just heard? No I'm afraid it
won't. The great tragedy is we may get a deal tonight but it delays
making the necessary adjustments, the need to be made to give the
Greek economy some chance of recovery. We've had several years
of depression or recession, because they're locked into a system that
doesn't work for them and the wrong exchange rate. If they patch it, it
doesn't produce a miracle cure. Why would the second package work when
the first one didn't. If the Dutch have their way, there will be
representatives of the three main financial institutions involved, in
Athens, making sure that you do as you say you'll do. Will the Greeks
accept that? Well, let not make a big deal what is actually pretty
much common practice. The IMF has a resident office in France, they're
there all the time. So I don't think there's an issue in having a
permanent presence of the troika. If I could respond, the two ways to
go forward. One is to declare bankruptcy and leave the Euro. A
lot of people say that. Those who say it, seriously underestimate the
economic and social cost for the Greeks, the Greek economy, and the
repercussions on the rest of tkpwruerp Europe. The other way is
hard, go forward by the necessary austerity and structural reforms
that give the country a capacity to grow again. It is not an easy road
and there's no magic bullets. We need the first programme, because
the first one did not have enough time to get the job done. This is
the better of the two roads. What would happen if you left the Euro?
Well, last Sunday the Greek Parliament voted on the new
austerity package, by a large two  thirds majority. If it voted
against, then the eurozone would stop, the aid programme for Greece,
and then in the next morning you would have queues outside the banks,
people trying to send the money out of the country. By midday, would
you have to shut down the banking system, by the end of the day, you
couldn't buy medicines from abroad or fuel, oil and gas, and soon we
wouldn't pay pensions and salaries. That's what would happen. People
talk about the exit of the Euro, if they can be done in an automatic
way. That's not the way it works. If you are outside, you can think
about dedevalueing, you do the adjustments that are necessary to
stay within the eurozone in a competitive world. John Redwood who
do you think what would happen? you plan it, it wouldn't happen. 87
countries, have left single currency, since the Second World
War, you plan it, and on a given day, announce the day, and it
hasity powers to protectity banks and print the currency. You devalue
and establish a new market rate, and that cut your debt burden and
makes you competitive. From that moment, you have a chance of
recovery. Iceland did it, and Iceland are in a better position
than Greece that is old yerg on. Now, tonight, it's my pleasure to
introduce our new political editor, Allegra Stratton once a producer on
this programme and latterly of the Guardian, it is always about
finding diamonds in dunghills, but there have been few from Allegra.
Lib Dems want a significant policy to lift the rate of income tax. So
before that level, you wouldn't pay any income tax and they want to
bring that 2010. Tories liked that, so it baims a coalition pledge. Now
what we're hearing is the Lib Dems think this should be faster,
furious further. And we don't know what the Tories think, because they
think they're not going public how they will negotiate ahead of the
Budget. Today we're talking to David Laws why they want to go
further, faster, more furious, what I find is if it could be brought in
more quickly T would end austerity. I haven't talked to anyone that
thinks there's a silver bullet, for austerity and yet this is what the
Lib Dems want to that end. He is for many Conservatives, their
favourite Lib Dem. When David was in charge of Treasury and in charge
of spending cut, George Osborne said it was as if he was put on
earth to do the job that was asked of him. But now, in his first
television interview, since resigning from the cabinet, David
Laws stels George Osborne the time has come to begin answered to
austerity. We have to distinguish between the period of austerity for
public spending, and public services which is clearly going to
go on for a period of time, from the austerity we've seen for
household budgets. They've been falling since 2008. Now we've
completed most of the tax increases, now we're seeing inflation this
year, on a firm downward track, that gives us the opportunity, if
we can make these other reductions in taxation, by increasing the
income tax thresh holds, as Nick Clegg has suggested, that gives us
the opportunity of ending the austerity and household budgets and
allowing the Budget of most people, the household budgets of most
people, to start expanded from this year to next year. That would make
a big difference to the economy and millions of people, who have been
through one of the toughest periods in terms of household budgets in
living memory. Nick Clegg called for an increase in personal
allowances for low and middle earners, but now unone of the
advisers raced the stakes. By making the claim it would end
austerity, language used by the Opposition, David Laws is telling
the Chancellor there's an alternative. The big question
remains, how will they pay for it? Will they, for instance, rule out
cuts on low and middle income earners to fund the policy. In
terms of the party's principles, is it your bottom line now, that any
of this, income and thresh holds has to be funded from the well off,
it cannot be funded from taking of tax credits? We certainly don't
want to be see any measures that would fund the personal allowance
that would be regressive. It would be bizarre to take from low incomes,
to other people. You're ruling that out? Yes. Measures that would fund
the personal allowance by taking money off people on middle and low
incomes. The pensions of the most wealthy appear to be in their
sights? I suspect what the Government will look at is whether,
for the most of fluent, 5%, and 5% of people, across all the
allowances, in the system for people, we can make changes, that
take away some of the subs zis that are going to the top 1% or 5% delix,
and get to them where they're needed. Green faxes has been
floated, can you go for a green tax, when that might push up bills more?
There is a real issue in the short  term, about whether we would want
to add, for example, to petrol and energy bills at a time when oil
prices have spiraled higher and people's household budgets have
been squeezed. To add further to the green taxes with high energy
price sincere, something that would not be sensible to do in the short 
term. Let look at two alternative ideas being floated, the
Conservatives, are our old friend an anonymous sources, why not use
the money you are suggested that can be found, use with employers to
help with national insurance, so they hire more people? The agreed
priority on tax, if the coalition Government is to raise the personal
allowance to ï¿½10,000, that's what we agreed when the two party got
together. That takes precedence over all the other tax priority.
Are the libkems right? Could their policy unsqueeze the squeezed
middle? Our forecasts take thoo account policies that are announced
and middle income is to fall slightly in 2012, but it wouldn't
take much to reverse that, and have a small rise, like a give away in a
higher personal allowance. Are the Lib Dems, now, Britain's tax
cutting party? I think that we are. That will make Conservatives
bristle. Opinion on their side ranges the Chancellor should not
allow the Lib Dems to own the proposal. Then there is some that
propose different tax cuts. And others of a recent warning of the
down grade in credit rating, allowance no room for manoeuvre.
Conservatives are saying the lick democrat may get the increaseness
that Lib Dems, like David Laws are calling for, but there's irritation
in the manner if not not the substantial. Is They don't
understand why they went early, when David Cameron's loyal advisers,
met to discuss long term strategy, they talked about whether the Lib
Dem bail earlier from Government. Do you understand why people are
irritated? What I would say as a strong supporter of the coalition,
you don't end up with a destructive prose, where both parties are
trying to block the proposals, so you independent up with a paralysis,
where the Government doesn't get things done. A constructive one
will make the coalition more sustainable because the two party
will feel happier. And it leads to a competition of ideas, which is
potentially good for the country. The Lib Dems have put down a marker
they think they can ease the squeeze for the less well off. They
want credit from the electorate for trying to do so, if it happens or
not. With many cut yet to take effect, the credibility of their
claim will be tested. Allegra is still here. I think I can see why
you journalists are exr excited about it, but for the public why is
it significant? Because, the general public, they know all three
political leaders talk about the squeezed middle. It is Ed Miliband
phrase, but the other two have jumped on the wagon. When for the
previous three years, no one's talked about the squeezed middle,
like it is an easy thing that can go away. We knew they wanted it
from the Budget, but we didn't know what magic wand it would end up
being. Everybody I talked to over the past year or two years, when
you talked about the squeezed middle, for many out there, it is
not a theme, it is a way of life, I understand that. But in terms of
the political leaders, if they thought it was a way to solve it
like that, they would have done it. There's no doubt that David Laws is
speaking for the party here? don't doubt it. He is one of Nick
Clegg's closest advisers, he doesn't absolve from that label. He
is one of the most respected economic minds in not just the Lib
Dems but the Government. He is also a big, as he said in the package, a
big zel leb for the coalition, still. First, Daniel Finkelstein
and Steve Richards are here to shed more light on this. What do you
make of it? Well, two things, first, the Lib Dems, even the so called,
orange book Lib Dems, like Nick Clegg and David Laws were always
pretty ardent, believers in redistribution through tax. I
remember before the election, they were more overt about their support
for redistribution, the Gordon Brown, who never used the word,
redistribution, didn't dare do so, even though policies did it.
They've been keen on the specific policy. Of course it was part of a
coalition agreement they would reach, to get people out on low pay
out of tax. It is more the manner in way they're promoting this
particular policy now, to make it absolutely clear, to the voters,
that come the Budget, this will have campaigned for something they
believed to be fair, and that they're determined to be associated
with, if, and when it is announced. Is George Osborne going to pay
attention? He will have to, and I think he will want to. Reducing tax
on people is what Conservatives believe and want to do, so
therefore, this doesn't cause a fundamental problem. This is one of
the glues in the amendment. I am less keen, because if you take
people out of tax, they become less responsible for what we spend
publicly. This proposal that David Laws goes out and tries to promote
the Lib Dems doing it, the problem is in ordertor people to take this
idea, they'll have to know who David Laws was and was a tax
allowance was. And few people know either of one of those things.
That's not cynical, that is what happens when you poll people. They
don't know what these things are. They will judge, whether they're
better off. It is interesting, isn't it the way in which language
is changing, attitudes are changing, too, about the rich and the tax.El
What's happened here, or is what happening? When there's no growth,
fairness becomes a bigger issue and people get scratchy about fairness
issues. Part is reflected in debate about tax, whether the well off is
taxed enough and other is reflected in other issues, welfare fraud,
emgration, these become emgration issue. It is a big change anding
from one. I read most days, since the financial crash the debate in
Britain and elsewhere, has moved to the right. Tax, in 199, Gordon
Brown and Tony Blair didn't dare say thinking about putting the top
rate of tax up. And now you have David Cameron and George Osborne
who would die to cut that top rate and all the focus is how you get
the low paid and pay less tax and as David Laws implied, get the
money from the wealthy as welfare reform. So the focus has changed
and to talk about redistribution in some shape or other, has become
legitimate. Under Blair and Brown, they didn't utter the words.
Because the economy was growing, and therefore people:. They were
scared to as well. Scared because they thought they would ruin the
thrust of growth. That remains a danger. If you increase tax burden
on earning up on the scale, and continues to earn your money that
way, you risk retarding growth and that's a risk the Government would
run, if it forever, redistributed tax. This is politics, following
social change is it? I think it is all created by the fact we've run
out of money. In a situation where you've run out of money, how you
distribute it, becomes scratchy and ditch. In the 1950s, the Labour
Party said it would find it difficult to redistribute it in a
situation where there wasn't any growth. He realises it becomes
scratchy. It go back to a few years, Blair and Brown loved to be
surrounded by bankers, they used them as a shield. Now no one would
go near a banker, so there have been deep changes, in a very short
period of time. So, people can talk openly, about whether there should
be another tax on banker's bonuses. You are right to raise the issue of
growth. But clearly the space between the fairness in the tax
system, without jeopardising growth. The important sthing intensifies
fairness issues, also like welfare fraud politically, because it is
all about, people feeling other people, whoever they are, are
putting in, taking out when they haven't put in. When there's no
growth and people are feeling pinched that feeling intensifies,
not just people at the top end of the spectrum, but like the benefit
cap was a popular political measure, because it goes to the bottom area
as well. In the end, tax and spend, more than anything else, decides
electionness Britain. Thank you. Now it is stop short of saying
Britain's borders might have been more secure if they were guarded by
Homer Simpson and the dog, but only just. The inquiry into how border
controls was suspended, today, res vales a catalogue of ineptness, and
confusion at a political level. The Home Secretary's decided as a
sequence, to reorganise the whole thing.
It was a David Cameron promise, and priority. Real limit, proper
enforcement, real control over how many people come here and who they
are. But what's transpired is chaos, resignation of a senior civil
servant and blame and shame, tossed back and forth. It all invites
Mickey Mouse headlines. It turns out in four years, there's no
warnings index checks on EU nationals boarding Eurostar trains
from EuroDisney and ski resorts. That's about half a million
passengers unchecked. Passports we must note were looked at but the
extra security measures were too oven suspended forgotten about. The
fingerprint checks were suspended no fewer than 480 times in the last
15 months. The Home Secretary, who last year, blamed the Border
Agency's boss, leading him to quit, now appears to be blaming the
entire agency. The Vine Report reveals a border
force, that enforced checks without thing, new technologies but chose
not to use them. Led to managers that did not communicate with staff,
and excluded key information. she didn't say is alongside civil
servants her colleagues are accused of lacking clarity, failing to
communicate what the Government wanted officials to do. It singles
out Damian Green on suspending A former immigration adviser says
ministers couldn't have asked the right questions. There was
questions they should have been asking about what they were going
on at the border, they didn't take interest from an med, which claims
to be committed to sorting out. These are obvious questions?
Obvious questions like when are the checks spwg suspended, they were
supposed to be weekly reports, that they stopped getting and they
didn't ask why, there was questions like how many people are turned
away, those part of the information were not being given to them, but
they should have asked about them. The Home Secretary suggested all
the difficulties, dated back to the Labour Government, Labour accused
her of ducking responsibility. The watch index checks were
suspended zero times in 2007, sim times in 2009, 33 times, in 2010,
and 50 times in the first, nine months of 2011. So the clear
suggestion in this report is the lack of staff may have increased
the problems at the borders agencies in the last year, and
she's hidden that information in her statement to Parliament.
course, this is all too familiar for a department which, in another
context was famously said to be "unfit for purpose". Labour
introduced its immigration reforms, now Theresa May say nounsed she's
spliting the Border Agency in two. From the March 1, the UK brder
force will be split were UCBA and will become a separate operational
command with the own law enforcement, and accountability to
ministers. A big structural is a class yck tactic, there might be
good argument for it, for having a tightly focused boreer force, I
myself are sceptical about that. The failings identifyed in this
report are all about, everybody in the organisation being clear about,
what the policy is and how sincere applied. If you separate it into
different agencies, sometimes that gets harder. The other thing is
having a big organisation at a time, when the border force is going to
try with the Olympics, that's a real risk. Of course, risk is what
the Border Agency, is supposed to avert. It is a tall order, and so
far, no immigration controls imposed by any Government, have
matched up to all the bold promise toss tighten up. Well now before we
look at the papers, the Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley had a
bruising confrontation with a 75  year old former trade union rep,
who tried to block his path, ahead of a meeting at the NHS reforms.

Well, she made the front page of most of the newspapers in front,

And Allegra Stratton is still here. What's caught your eye on
tomorrow's papers. My former newspaper, they've done a poll and
showed the opinion poll lead, that the David Cameron and Conservatives
had post of the year, but lost that, because of the handling of the NHS.
This won't be a shock, they have lots of polling, some is public, it
shows they're lacking on the NHS handling area. The problem for them
is the because there's so many reforms is under way, they are
looking at least, worse options, you either shelf something, which
is not likely and create chaos, because you Sheffield performance
in process, and you shelfed something and create more chaos
because reform is under way. Even know the ka kakofy grows louder, it
won't budge them. It will continue. Well that's all from Newsnight
tonight. More tomorrow, until then Hello a much milder light tonight
compared to last night, thanks to a thick blanket of cloud. Eastern
areas will brighten up but will keep sunshine in the west.
We'll see breaks developing in the cloud, towards north east. Sunny
spells possible across southern counties of England. If the sun
pops out, temperatures will pop up, up to 1 degrees.
South west will stay cloudy and Wales. A dull damp start, rain
peters out. Brighter skies over north east Wales. The eastern half
of Northern Ireland should brighten up, with sunny spells. It will stay
damp, in western parts of Scotland. But across the North East here,
temperatures up to 11, and 1. Along the Murray Firth. We could reach 13
on Thursday, but it won't feel like that, because of a strong wind. The
