We are the champions
Greatest of them all
We are the champions
Always on the ball
Right through the season You'll hear us call
Home or away We're gonna win them all
We are the champions!
Rather fetching tracksuits   check.
Whistle   check.
Clipboard and pen   check.
Oh, yes, it can only mean one thing.
Sport Relief and We Are The Champions are coming
together to form Sport Relief Does We Are The Champions!
Yes! Our teams are hoping to be on course dry side.
That's right, Paddy.
Our teams have five mighty challenges in...
Let's meet our teams and their team coaches,
starting with the Red team.
Their coach is a basketball player who won gold
at the Paralympic World Cups in 2005.
Give a very loud welcome for Ade Adepitan!
Ade, introduce us to your team.
Yes, they're Broomfields Junior School in Warrington!
And who's this rapscallion at the back?
That's Bouncer, our kangaroo. Watch out for his pouch.
Let's meet the Green team. Their coach was the first Briton to win
an Olympic medal in individual gymnastics for over 100 years.
It's pommel horse superstar, Lewis Smith!
  Introduce us to your team.
  Who's this at the back?
This is Paws, our bouncing bear.
Finally, let's meet the yellow team.
Their coach is the reigning world floor champion,
considered to be the most successful British gymnast of all time.
  It's none other than Beth Tweddle!
Beth, introduce us to your team.
Our team are Whitecote Primary in Leeds.
  Who's this at the back?
  This is our lovely mascot, Perky the Parrot.
Our teams, everybody. Not only are they trying to win today,
they're trying to get a top three spot on our leaderboard
for a place in Friday's final, to win this,
the Sport Relief Does We Are The Champions trophy.
What are the scores they need to beat?
After heat one, the leaderboard looks like this.
So those are the scores to beat today.
Carrying sand filled balls around
an obstacle course in your pants has got to be easy, right?
Ooh, that chafes a bit. This is Pairs Of Pants.
Using strength, teamwork and a pair of tracksuit pants, our teams must
carry sand filled bonus balls from one end of the course to the other.
They could be in a sticky situation if they get stuck in the bungee web.
Once through, will they be able to scale the heights of the pant ramp?
From the top, there's only one way to go,
and that's down, down, down, into the ball pool.
If they make it through the balls, it's a quick jump out
and a dash to the unloading zone to deposit the bonus balls.
There's a massive 60 possible bonus points on offer.
  Teams, are you ready?
  Yes!
You better be!
  On your marks, get set...
Pairs of Pants is underway!
First they need to load up the bonus balls.
Come on!
Yellows are first through. This is good!
Come on, Greens, move it!
Andy and Milly for the Reds,
followed by Kieran and Milly for the Yellows.
Work, George!
  Come on, Alex, get moving!
  Andy and Milly first into the pit,
and first out of the pit as well.
Good play by the Reds. Kieran and Milly doing well for the yellows.
Go on, George, get up there, son.
Get a hold of that rope, and climb like you've never climbed before!
Look at Kieran fall head first, shoulder first,
but it was a soft landing.
Greens, you've got to get down!
Oh, Reds are through the bungee net, they've got another two on the go.
Come on, Greens, work quicker.
Come on, Yellow, let's go.
Rowan giving Ellie a helping hand, all within the rules.
Greens, they're off again.
The Greens are loading up. Charlotte and Maya.
They look like very dainty ladies, but how will they play?
Joseph! Look how many
balls Joseph has in his pants. Is he even able to move?
Each ball weighs 2.5 kilos. No wonder he's struggling.
Get up!
Move yourself, Yellows. Come on!
Anyone would think they were heavy.
Ben and Lucy, final pair for the Reds.
Reds, you're in the lead at the minute. Keep it going.
Go mad! Come on!
The Reds have whacked you, Yellows, they've whacked you!
This is rubbish!
  And the Reds have won it, 75 points!
Get your leg over, me old son.
Joseph and Emily really struggling.
They can't stop laughing, that doesn't help the speed!
It looks like Greens will make second place.
Here come Katie and Joe, for the Greens.
Over the line. 50 points for the Greens!
And the Yellows bringing up the rear. I'm not entirley sure
that Shannon helped Brendan, though!
She's pushed him over. He's really struggling for balance.
But he's done fantastically well.
Over you get.
Jump over there.
A bit more. Get over that finish line!
  Yellows third.
  Yay! At last!
Whilst the Yellows stumbled, fell and pushed each other over,
the Reds kept focused, and even lapped the other teams
en route to an impressive victory.
Milly, first game, first place.
  Can you keep it up?
  Yes, we've got a really strong team,
and we'll stick to our motto, that teamwork is the key to success.
Oh, good answer. Joseph, what happened in the ball pool?
The balls were too heavy and I couldn't lift my leg out the pool.
  Joseph, that's absolute rubbish, sunshine.
  Booooo!
The Yellow team need to pull their Sport Relief socks up.
Let's look at the scores on the doors.
Coaches, your team's bonus scores, please.
  Ade.
  The Red team had six bonus balls, giving a total of 30 points.
  Lewis.
  The green team, six bonus balls, 30 points.
  Beth?
  Yellow team, six bonus balls, 30 points.
So, after game one, in the lead, with 105 points,
  is the Red team, Broomfields!
This game's all about ball control. Ugh!
I meant that to happen.
It's Ballistic.
Medic!
Our teams have to manoeuvre the massive balls
in a straight sprint to the balance pod.
After a chance to collect bonus discs,
it's across the zigzag beam, before the whole team's strength
is needed to make it over the giant hurdle.
A last dash, and the Ballistic finish line awaits.
  Here's your clipboard, Mr McGuinness, sir.
  Very good.
There are 75 points on offer for the winning team.
  Are you lot ready?
  Yes!
  On your marks, get set...
We're going Ballistic!
  They're all off, it's neck and neck!
  That's heroic defending by Shannon.
Slowing the ball down.
Get that ball on there. Three seconds.
Greens are away. Yellows are away, the Reds are a bit slow.
Through the bonus discs, up on to the balance beam.
The Greens are just...
Oh, they've come off!
The ball has to make contact at all times.
Excellent play by the Yellows.
The Yellows storming in front. I can't believe it!
Greens are playing catch up.
Something's working. The coach is doing a good job.
No one's allowed round the sides. The Reds, are in second place.
Can they come back into this?
Come on, Yellows, you've got it, this game! Yes!
Come on, Reds, get it over. What's up with you?
That's the fellow.
You've got to get to the end, though, Reds.
50 points are in the bag for them. Oh! Someone's fallen over!
Let's have a look again! Lucy has lost her footing.
Will it cost them? No, it won't!
It's 50 points for the Reds.
Yellows really needed to dig deep and with unbelievable ball control,
selfless team play and top team work, they did.
First place, what's it smell like?
Success smells good and we're hungry for more.
  Whoa!
Andy, how was Ballistic for you?
It was a fun and a challenge but we're ready to win the next round.
Touch me. Respect.
The Yellow team were really on a roll there,
  so let's put the scores...
  On the doors!
Coaches, your team's bonus scores, please.
  Ade?
  The red team got one bonus disc,
giving us a total of five bonus points.
  Lewis?
  The green team got one bonus disc,
giving us a total of five bonus points.
  Beth?
  The Yellow team unfortunately got no bonus discs,
therefore no points.
Oh, so let's add those Ballistic scores to the team totals.
Still in the lead with 160 points, it's the Red team! Broomfields!
It could all change again on the scoreboard.
Will the teams get a tow to the top?
Or slide away to victory?
Not only does this game rattle your nerves,
but it also rattles your bones and your teeth! This is Barrow Ball.
Our teams will push each other round the course in a barrow.
They'll be all shook up on the rumble strips,
then their balance will be tested on the see saw,
before heading to the ramp to jump into the ball pit.
They'll need to find a bonus ball to throw at the only goal with bite.
It's the Eclipser.
Out of the pit, it's back in the barrow
and a sprint to tag the next pair.
It's 75 points for the first team, 50 for the second
and 25 for the third. Plus five extra points
for every bonus ball thrown through the Eclipser.
  Are you ready to roll?
  Yes!
  On your marks, get set...
Barrow Ball is underway.
They're on to the rumble strips, over the see saw.
Great start for the Reds, but look at the Yellows. Brendan's face!
That looks pretty painful, but he's hanging on in there.
Ouch! Slow landing for the Yellows.
Reds are first in there.
  Now for the Eclipser.
  Oh, he's missed it!
He's in, good throw.
Neck and neck with the red and green.
  Excellent play.
  Reds are off. Oh, he's nearly took a tumble there.
This could... The Greens are straight in though. Let's go.
Reds have their second team underway already. Oh, look at Lucy's face.
Ow! That's a rumble face all right!
Now she's going to be all wobbly legs.
Ooh! Ooh! It's neck and neck, the red and green.
Warrington doing well. Oh, Lucy's taken a trip.
But she's all right. She's carrying on.
What a miss from close range for the Reds and from Lucy.
Come on, yellows!
Good score from the Greens there.
Come on. Get it up there, Yellows.
You can do it! You can catch up!
Milly and Ellie for the Reds now.
And score for Emily.
Reds are here again.
  Reds over the see saw.
  Ooh!
Bang! Up the final ramp and into the ball pit.
This is good teamwork for the Reds.
Greens, you gotta pick it up!
Take your... That's it!
Oh, he's took a tumble in the ball pond!
Get the ball. Pick it up with your hands and throw it, man.
What's up with you? No!
Come on! Get back up! Hurry up!
The Reds are in the lead.
Surely they can't blow it now?
They don't. Warrington have won it.
  75 points for them.
  Come on, Yellows.
Let's go.
Whitecote of Leeds are bringing up the rear. They can't win,
so the bonus balls are even more important than ever.
No! Joseph misses! Can Kieran rescue some points?
He can! What a throw!
Well worth seeing that again.
Only just manages it.
Move it, man! Put your back into it.
In your own time, boys.
A great Barrow Ball is always about those rumble faces. Ooh! Agh!
But the Reds have rumbled away with a second victory.
Lucy, you were on fire there but can you keep it up wetside?
Well, all I can say is a little bit of water won't put our fire out.
Ooh! Good answer. Emily, you were first place in the last game,
but last place in that game. What went wrong?
Well, the wheelbarrow was very hard to push and over the rumble strips
  it felt like your teeth falling out.
  More excuses!
Get them barrows back in my shed.
We need scores, we need doors. We need scores on the doors.
Coaches, your bonus scores, please.
  Ade?
  The Red team got two bonus balls, giving us 10 bonus points.
  Lewis?
  The Green team got four bonus balls, giving us 20 points.
  Beth?
  The Yellow team got five bonus balls, so 25 points.
Ooh, while the Reds are still in the lead with 245,
we have a tie for second place on 180 points.
It's the Greens and Yellows!
This is no ordinary series of We Are The Champions.
  Isn't that right, Ade?
  Yes, Padde.
  Padde?
  Ade.
Let's have a look at why... Get off!
Why we're all here today
and what these guys are lending their support to.
Watch it...
Come on! Yes!
Sport Relief helps people to turn their lives around.
Not only in the UK, but across the world's poorest countries.
This year is no different.
So if you want to rise to the challenge
and take part in the Sport Relief mile on Sunday 21st March,
then grab your grown up and check the CBBC website...
You're watching We Are The Champions and it's all for Sport Relief.
As you can see we've brought our teams wetside,
but they'll need more than a doggy paddle
if they want to be top labradoodle here today.
It's game No. 4. Let's go Disc Go!
This is a test of speed and balance as our teams will relay
across the water, using a tow rope and riding a floating disc.
Disc riders try to collect bonus balls as they skim across the pool.
Each disc rider can add a potential 15 bonus points to each team score.
  Are you lot ready?
  Yes!
  On your marks, get set...
  And they're off.
  They're in and we're off.
  Reds are away first.
  Ooh!
Followed closely by the Yellows.
Ben versus Maya in the swim off.
Greens are just edging it. Who's going to reach the disc rider first?
We just don't know!
We do now, Paddy. It's Rowan.
Rowan's off. He needs to keep his balance.
That's good tactics from Rowan. Down on his knees.
He's allowed to do this to collect the bonus balls.
It's so much easier than when you're on your feet.
That's it, get your ball in.
And Rowan's gliding away and he's got to take his disc with him.
  One more in.
  Keep pulling, Yellows.
Neck and neck. Get it in quicker. Quicker, come on let's go!
This is a really tight race.
Warrington flying ahead in the red.
Chellaston of Derby in the green and Whitecote of Leeds in the yellow.
Kim, go, go, go! Go! Go!
Reds have stalled, they need some good swimmers there.
Milly's waiting for the Reds and it's Milly for the Yellows as well.
  It's a popular name round these parts.
  Reds are on their way again.
She's gliding away. Surfing USA, or in Sheffield it's more US eh oop.
And now she's going for the bonuses.
Keep going, come on, Greens, push!
Never mind your hair.
And the race is on!
Balance! Get them bonus balls.
Careful, don't fall in. That's it.
Forget that last one. Get it in your little thingy.
And she dismounts.
She's got to get this disc out of the water to get the 75 points.
They're so close.
That's the one.
Warrington have won it for the Reds and the race is on for second place.
It's Milly of Leeds in the yellow. Joe of Derby in the green.
They've got to get the disc out the water. Surely it will be Leeds.
Oh, and he's done it!
Let's have a look at the replay. It was Leeds who came second.
From start to finish, that was a masterclass in Disc Going.
The swimmers swam like Olympians.
The disc riders rode like pro skaters keeping all the teams
in with a chance of winning. Top race.
Shannon, a photo finish for second place.
What was going through your mind?
The thing going through my mind was pull, pull!
I can't let my team down. Luckily we came in second.
Charlotte, what happened?
Well, when George started to swim,
he was really fast and then we were shouting at him
and he hadn't got the rope on him, so he had to swim all the way back.
Ooh, I feel a scapegoat coming.
George, where are you? Boo!
What a game! Let's have a look at the scores on the doors.
Coaches, your team's bonus scores, please.
  Ade?
  The Reds got five bonus balls, giving us a score of 25 points.
  Lewis?
  The Green team got two bonus balls, giving us 10 points.
  Beth?
  The Yellow team got all six bonus balls, therefore 30 points.
Well, if we add those scores to the team's totals,
it's the Red team for Warrington racing away with 345 points!
There can be no drips in these teams if they want to survive Splashdown.
Can someone get Tweddle out the water? Showing off.
Belly flop.
Tactics and team work are the keys to this final game.
A player swims to their team mates, pushing a bowl of target balls,
which they'll use to throw at the overhead targets.
When the target's hit, bonus hoops will drop into the pool.
The team will then swim one at a time
to collect one of these bonus hoops before attempting to scale the ramp.
As they slide down, they must throw their hoop at the target
for bonus points.
(First team to have all six points...) OK.
The first team to have all six players splashed down
will add a vital 75 points to their score. Are you ready?
  Yes!
  Are you sure?
  Yes!
  You've got to make this one count.
  On your marks, get set...
And they've started Splashdown.
Ooh! What's that with the Greens?
The Greens have lost their balls already.
Let's see that again...
Charlotte's lost the balls for the Greens.
Get your balls, Greens!
This is shocking.
Joseph with a throw. Oh, it's a successful one.
And Shannon's in the water first.
Followed by the Reds and the Greens.
Good start by the Yellows.
Andy, Shannon and Katie.
Push and pull! Push and pull. Push and pull.
Up to the cargo rope.
They've got to haul themselves out of the water and up on to the rope.
This is much harder than it looks.
It's the Reds!
Reds are in again.
  Greens! In!
  Milly for the Reds there. Going really well.
It's Maya for the Greens who's second in the water.
But poor old Shannon is still there.
Where's Yellow?
It's an absolute nightmare. She's got to think of the team.
She's got to find the strength from somewhere and she's doing it.
Come on, Shannon!
In the meantime, Milly's away and it's splashdown for the Reds.
Rowan in the water.
  Come on, Yellow!
  Poor old Shannon.
She can't get out of that water and on to the rope. Maya's splashdown.
Go on. Yes!
Brilliant. Get up there.
Splashdown for Rowan.
And he's missed the target as well.
It's really difficult to get a bonus.
Shannon's up. Excellent play by Shannon.
Splashdown.
Well done, Yellow.
  Come on, Yellow. Next one in.
  And Emily's off for the Yellows.
They're playing catch up. They've got a heck of a lot of work to do.
Get to that edge there. Go on, keep going, you're nearly there!
Ooh, nearly!
Here comes Lucy for the Reds.
We need some bonus discs here.
Splashdown, but she's off target.
Here comes Ben.
Come on, Yellow. Keep going.
Emily splashdown for the Yellows and Milly takes the baton next.
Reds are on their penultimate swimmer already. That's Ben.
After this, it's only Ellie.
Splashdown again!
Splashdown.
Reds are in with their last player.
Ellie's in the water. Surely they're unstoppable?
As long as she doesn't have
the same problems that poor old Shannon had getting out the water.
Joe's the Green swimmer, Chellaston of Derby.
This could be splashdown.
Yellows are gaining back valuable ground.
Reds have splashed down. They've won it.
Ade Adepitan, absolutely delighted with his team's 75 points.
She almost dropped the hoop, but it doesn't really matter.
Hurray!
Surely the Green team will pick up the 50 points for second place?
  Here's the Green's last splashdown.
  That's 50 points for Derby.
Yellows need a bonus.
Kieran splashes down. No bonus points for the Yellows.
You've got it!
Brendan's bringing up the rear to eventually claim 25 points.
After two games of Splashdown, we still have zero bonus hoops.
Zero, nada. That's zilch.
Come on, people. The Reds won't care though, they've won!
George, you're the Green team.
You weren't green then, you did brilliant. How was it?
  It's good to come in a higher place than last time.
  Touch me, George.
I'm down with the kids.
Bouncer! The Red team, another win.
How was that?
Ade's what?
In your pouch? I'm not sure about that.
Well, our teams have splashed down, so let's see how that affects
the final scores on the doors.
Coaches, your team's bonus scores, please.
  Ade?
  The Red team got zero rings,
so we got a very soppy, soaking, zero points.
  Lewis?
  The Green team unfortunately got no rings, which means no points.
  Beth?
  The Yellow team did absolutely fantastic...and got none.
So, no points.
Well, this is nail biting stuff.
For the last time, let's add those scores to the team's totals.
Everyone did great,
but the winning team on 420 points is the Red team.
  Broomfields!
What a result. But how does that affect the leaderboard?
Those three teams are heading towards the final.
It's been another fantastic day
on Sport Relief Does We Are The Champions.
Thank you to all our teams
and a massive thank you to our celebrity team coaches.
Ade! Beth! Lewis!
There's only one thing left for me to say.
3, 2, 1, away you go!
We are the champions
Greatest of them all
We are the champions
Always on the ball
Right through the season You'll hear us call
Home or away We're gonna win them all
