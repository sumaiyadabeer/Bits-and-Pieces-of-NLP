My name is Philippa Paccard.
I'm English.
I have the right to testify in my native language.
Philippa Paccard.
23rd of May 1971.
Bristol.
I teach... I'm a teacher.
Um...
..I don't know.
I was in the process of, um... I was getting divorced.
It was over a year ago, my husband died during the proceedings.
No, he died before.
Um...
No, um...
Was it only four p people who died?
No, no, no...
I just mean the office... The man in the office... I put the bomb in his office. I...
Nobody.
I don't...
I don't have a husband.
He's dead.
He overdosed. Look...
you know all this.
I've been calling, I've been writing...
I've been trying to get your attention for years.
Here. The carabinieri.
I wanted to talk to them, I wanted...
to tell them about the...the man who controls the drug scene.
I knew him. He studied with my husband. Because of him, children die every week.
He's not dead!
Where am I?
Who are you?
Oh...! I'm sorry...
I'm sorry!
No, please... No, please...!
Vendice was a friend of my husband's.
They were students.
He was like all of them,
but then he started to get the drugs and sell them to other people,
and then he had a business and now he's got this industry.
He still gave my husband a discount.
He even gives the kids in my school a discount.
Probably gives the carabinieri a discount.
I have taught 13 year old children who have already been in rehab.
  There have been deaths in the school.
This is what I have been writing and writing and writing and writing to you about.
Forget the business, the computers...
I have copies of those letters in my apartment.
Now, initially I sent them by mail, but then I just brought them in myself.
I have receipts. They have been stamped by the carabinieri.
  Yes.
  Si.
  Yes.
  Si.
No.
No, no, that's not right.
Whose signature is this?
Michele firma.
You signed this?
Nobody helped me.
I found it in my apartment after my husband died.
Suppose...someone... Or he...
Were there really two children?
'I spoke with my brother.
'He's 11 years old and he's one of your pupils.
'He told me that he likes you the most of all the teachers.
'He told me that you are a good person.
'I believe that.
'That's why I want to help you.
'If you agree, please record that you agree
'and leave the tape under the table in the interrogation room.
'There is a small shelf under the table top.'
'I'm the one who translates for you.
'I was there when the doctor treated you.
'You squeezed my fingers tightly.'
'I agree.'
Thursday, around 10 o'clock, you'll have a stomach ache.
You'll got to the bathroom and return after seven minutes.
If you find what I left for you there, signal to me.
'Then around 11 o'clock, you'll feel ill again.
'You'll return to the bathroom.
'You'll hear the telephone ringing in the hallway,
'then it will stop ringing because the guard will have picked up the receiver.
'That's when you leave the bathroom.
'You'll get into the elevator and go down to the garage.
'From there, you go up half a flight of stairs.
'You will leave the building through a small door that opens onto the rear courtyaerd.
'Then you will go down a path that leads around the enclosure into the street.
'Throw your sweater into the rubbish bin and head straight for the train station.
'I'll drive there in a car in the evening
'and pick you up at the rear entrance.'
And then we'll think of what to do next...
..because I believe there will be something...
'..and that it will be beautiful.'
I found a bag...
..a note and a key in the toilet.
In the bag was a syringe and the test results from a HIV clinic.
  The note had just three words.
The key opened the door to the school glasshouse.
One of my pupils, Carla   she'd been hanging there for three days.
"Throw me out with the trash."
Her parents had to read that.
The carabinieri came...
..said there was nothing for them to do...
..so last Tuesday I went to her funeral in the morning...
..and in the afternoon I went to Vendice's office...
..with the bomb.
Why did you change the plan?
My father always said that, at the right moment,
you have to do what nobody expects.
How did you know about this attic?
I spent days here when I was a child.
This was my hiding place.
My father was the chief of the carabinieri for Turin.
Do you know why I said I agree?
Do you know why I want to escape?
I don't want to escape punishment.
I've killed four innocent people.
And I want to answer for that.
But before I do...
..I want to kill him.
That's the only reason I agreed to escape.
You were sleeping beside me.
It's there.
Who was that?
They were cleaning women.
One of them found the body this morning.
She said she'll remember it for the rest of her life.
What about you?
We're going to have to leave this place.
Where will we go?
I'd like you to take me to the place where you grew up.
I don't even know your name.
Filippo.
When were you born?
May 23rd, 1978.
At what time? Do you know?
In the morning at eight o'clock.
I know exactly what I was doing on May 23rd, 1978.
I know exactly.
That was the day of my first Holy Communion.
I was dressed up like a little bride
with this white dress and a veil my mother had made me.
She put the dress on and covered my face with the veil and burst into tears.
I don't know why.
It's as if nothing ever happened.
I've done a lot of damage
and some really stupid... stupid things.
I've lied to my mother and to my sister
many, many, many times.
I was unfaithful to my husband once.
And I didn't do everything I could to save him.
Anyway, maybe it's not possible to do everything.
Four people died because of me
and I can't live with that.
I'll never be able to.
I shot a defenceless person, which you know.
But...what you don't know is...
..I've ceased to believe.
Ceased to believe in what?
In sense...in justice...
..and life.
I love you.
No. It's...
just...
It's just I want the end to come soon.
The police will come.
Now?
Yes.
Now.
