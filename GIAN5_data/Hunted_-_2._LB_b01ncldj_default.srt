  How much longer?
  I have to tell you something.
Cafe Khalil. Four o'clock.
  I was set up.
  You think it was me.
You disappeared without a trace.
You want to find out who tried to kill you and you think
the best way is to let them try again.
Do I get my job back?
Look who dragged her ass back in the door.
  Good to see you, too.
  The target is Jack Turner.
Mr Turner is currently bidding to acquire the Upper Khyber Dam.
And our client wants to ensure that he loses.
Dad!
Dad, this is Alex Kent. She saved Eddie.
He wants you to move in.
I'm supposed to screw him, not screw over his kid.
A stranger in this house?
Keel says there's a mole on the team.
Dutch engineer Horst Goebel. He arrives tonight.
Ja?
Something's going on.
This is Dr Horst Goebel.
Miss Kent.
This programme contains graphic violent scenes.
It's nice to meet you.
I'll let my father know you're here.
You're a...family friend, Miss Kent?
No. I'm looking after Mr Turner's son.
How nice.
Are you a doctor?
Not a medical doctor, no.
An engineer, consulting on a project.
  What kind of project?
  It's very technical, I'm afraid.
  Dr Goebel?
  Mr Turner.
Good to finally meet you, Doctor.
Indeed.
Let's talk through here.
Please, you go ahead and eat.
I'm going to go to bed.
  All right. Good night.
  Good night.
Won't need you for this one, Stevie.
Of course.
The Goebel meeting's started.
  Where's the audio?
  AF scramblers are interfering.
I thought Hasan was supposed to be shadowing this bloke from the City.
  He was.
  So where is he?
Try his mobile.
  There you go, sir.
  Thank you, John.
  Zoe, I need that audio.
  Yeah, I'm working on it.
  What is it?
  Hasan's not picking up.
  Something wrong?
  Why do you say that?
A little vein there. It throbs when you're tense.
I didn't realise I was so easily read.
  Water?
  Yeah.
They are outside now.
  Bring him through the side door and down to the lower basement.
  Sir.
  Got something out front.
  What is it?
Don't know yet.
Something's going down.
Shit! It's Hasan!
How did they bloody find him?
It's Sam. What do you want me to tell her?
  Yeah?
  'The Turners have Hasan.'
Was he careless?
  It's unlikely.
  Betrayed?
More likely.
Shall I instruct Sam to retrieve him?
Not an option.
Look, he can't remain in that house, it leaves Sam vulnerable,
puts us at risk if we're to stay operational.
Yes, but we can't retrieve him.
And we have to stay operational. Whatever the cost.
Are you authorising removal?
Yeah.
Removal is authorised.
Sam's texted again.
Tell her you need to meet.
Get this cleaned up. I want it spotless.
  Get things cleaned up outside, is that understood?
  Yes, sir.
I'll let Mr Turner know.
Bingham? What's wrong?
Pardon the intrusion, sir...
I'm sorry to cut this short, Doctor, but something's come up.
Not at all. I expect we won't meet again...
  unless there's a problem.
  I expect not. It's a pleasure.
  Stevie, see Dr Goebel out.
  Of course.
  Can I offer you a drink, Doctor?
  No, thank you, I should be going.
If you could just point me to the bathroom, please.
Of course. There's one just there. I'll get your car.
Well, pick him up!
She needs the bypass code for the alarm,
basement south side window.
I don't know who your friends are,
but they can't like you very much, cos we got tipped off.
You've got the wrong man, I haven't done anything!
You don't know where you are, do you?
Well, you're somewhere you don't belong.
Somewhere you should never have come.
But now you're here...you're dead.
Do you understand what I'm saying, Abdul?
Now, we're going to ask you some questions.
Well, you might say to yourself "I'm not going to answer."
Either way you're dead.
So, what you got to decide
is how much pain can you bear before you go.
You have a little think about that.
And then you and I'll have a little conversation, all right?
Who sent you? Eh?
Who sent you to take my grandson?
  You clear?
  I'm clear.
  She tell you?
  Tell me what?
Where she's been for the past year.
No, not a word. Actually, I was hoping you might know something.
C'mon! Aidan, if there's anyone she'd tell, it'd be you.
What makes you say that?
That bloke Goebel's leaving.
  Without his case.
  Where's he headed?
He's booked on an early flight home.
I'll get Amsterdam to keep an eye on him.
Where are they keeping Hasan?
  Lower basement.
  Access?
No stairs. Magnetic key in the lift.
Just one   on the wrist   60 seconds till it absorbs.
You have a problem with this?
Don't you?
If all of us get such a quick death, we'll be lucky.
  Did you get anything on Goebel?
  Just the smell of his aftershave.
  He had a case with him.
  He left without it.
Crane wants you to find out what was inside it.
Nothing else to say?
You and Hasan weren't exactly best friends.
So now you think I set him up, too, do you?
Like I set you up in Tangier.
Hasan may be a prick, but he's not sloppy.
  I didn't set him up.
  Then who did?
At least now you're asking the right question.
  Fowkes.
  Milk! My hero!
  Sam?
  She's on it.
So what's she going to do then?
Shut up and eat your Weetabix, Fowkes.
  C'mon, one of our mates is down, how do we get him out?
  We don't.
What do you mean, we don't? That old bastard thinks Hasan tried to
kidnap his grandson.
  They'll torture him to death.
  Not if he's already dead.
She's going to kill Hasan?
What for?
You said it yourself. They'll torture him, he'll talk.
Exposing Sam and the rest of us.
That puts us all at risk, not just the operation.
  Sod this. I didn't sign up for this.
  Yeah, you did.
You signed up for whatever Byzantium orders you to do,
and you're bloody well paid for it, now sit down.
A man is down, we rescue him.
There are circumstances under which any of us could be terminated.
  Hasan understands that.
  Well, I don't.
All Turner knows right now is that Hasan tried to kidnap his grandson.
If Hasan reveals his work, it compromises our client...
We don't know who our client is!
..and puts us all in danger and the op is blown.
If Hasan talks. Not if we rescue him first.
A rescue proves that he's a professional.
If he dies in custody, the damage is contained.
And the operation continues.
Un fucking believable.
Bloody monsters, you are.
Dad.
What's that face for?
What did Bingham want?
  Oh, nothing for you to worry about.
  Nothing for me to worry about...
Same goes for Horst Goebel, I suppose.
What's your problem, son?
You say I'm important to your business,
you're shutting me out, pushing me away.
If I don't tell you certain things, it's because...
you're better off not knowing.
You told me this was legitimate, something I could be proud of.
And you can. And you should.
But you don't respect me, do you, Dad?
You never have.
You want my respect?
Earn it.
Matt, come here.
Give me a hand with these boxes. We'll take them out the back.
Yes, Mr Bingham.
Wait! Take it off.
You know I can't.
I shouldn't be here.
Someone betrayed me. Someone on the team!
Kill me, you will never find out who wants you dead.
What are you talking about?
  I know why you went into hiding. Why you came back.
  You're lying.
You're going to bet your life on it?
How else would I know? You didn't tell anyone, did you?
You tell me what you know.
Take it off.
Now.
Now you talk.
He came to me.
Who?
He had greying hair, a scar on his cheek.
I need a name!
  Miss Freeman? Miss Emma Freeman?
  Yes.
Lieutenant Colonel Cooley.
May I come in?
Sure.
How can I help you, Colonel?
Sorry to disturb you at this hour,
but we're looking for this woman.
You served in the Special Reconnaissance Regiment together,
did you not?
It's...it's ages since we've spoken.
You have no idea how I may locate her? Other friends, family?
Sam was a private person.
I was about the only friend she had, really.
What's this about, anyway?
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
I think you can.
I did it!
Sam, hide!
Get off! Get off me, I'm calling the police!
No!
Get off!
Get off!
Help! Help! Help!
  Good morning, everyone.
  Morning, Alex.
Good morning, sweet pea.
Coffee, Alex? Mrs Sidwa makes
what may possibly be the worst coffee in the world.
Try it and see.
  I'll have some tea, thanks.
  I'll get it for you, Miss Kent. Eggs?
How's your cereal?
  Do you like chocolate?
  Of course.
It's all chocolate!
  And it's very healthy, too.
  Sounds perfect to me.
In New York once, I remember Eddie eating the most extraordinary
chocolaty, peanut buttery...
Reese's Puffs.
  Reese's Puffs.
  They're my favourite.
  Thank you.
  We'll have to go back and buy you a ginormous box.
Well, Eddie needs his energy today.
We have a lot of lessons after school.
Talking of which, it's time you were off.
Can Alex take me this morning?
I'd be delighted.
Morning, Dad.
  Morning.
  Morning, Mr Turner.
No breakfast for me, Mrs S.
Yes, sir.
You ready, Alex?
Give me a second, I'll be right back.
Could I have a word?
Of course.
Look, I really appreciate what you've tried to do for me,
and Eddie's a wonderful boy, but I can't stay.
Why not?
It's pretty clear your father doesn't want me here.
He's a very difficult man. He tries to bully everyone.
You're the first person Eddie's made any connection with
since his mother died.
I can see he desperately wants you to stay. So do I.
I...I don't know.
Please?
Please stay.
Wakey wakey! Oh, you filthy sod.
Last chance. Who sent you?
Sir...
Sir!
Can you stop that?
  Stop what?
  Being you.
Listen to this.
"Chinese Industries Group manages and operates utilities
"in six countries, net assets in excess of a hundred billion pounds."
Buys a lot of egg rolls, that does.
You're obviously telling us this for a reason.
"The Chinese are considered the leading bidder in Pakistan's
"proposed sale of the Upper Khyber Dam project."
  Don't.
  Don't what?
  Speculate.
  I'm just curious.
What bloody client is paying Keel enough to kill our own man?
  You're not meant to know.
  Why not? In the Special Forces,
we at least knew who we were fighting for.
Keel will decide what you need to know.
Don't speculate on who the client is. Speculation leads to assumption.
Assumption leads to mistakes. And mistakes will get you killed.
You understand?
  Sam's on the move.
  So has she done it?
Has she killed Hasan?
No.
She would have signalled.
You want me to walk you in?
No.
After our lessons this afternoon, we'll go to the park. OK?
'The government sees a strong bond with the Saudis
'as crucial in furthering Britain's interest in the region.
'A 32 year old woman was killed in her flat
'in East London last night. Emma Freeman,
'who served in Afghanistan, died from a single bullet to the head
'by an unknown assailant.
'The victim's eight year old daughter witnessed the attack...'
Excuse me, sir?
Could you drop me off over there? I'm going to walk home.
'Police appeal to the public for any information.'
I'd like your thinking about how Hasan got taken.
Bad luck, I guess.
One of Turner's men must have seen him in the street.
That would be bad luck indeed, and extremely unlikely.
It's much more probable, isn't it, that Hasan was betrayed.
By whom?
We suspect there's a mole on the team. Surely Sam's told you?
You're her handler, after all.
It's not me, if that's what you're thinking.
What's your impression of Sam?
My impression?
Does she seem the same to you?
Do you perceive her capabilities to have diminished in any way?
No. I don't perceive that. Not at all.
It's been more than eight hours since Hasan was abducted.
I've assured our client we will carry out
the operation as planned, but I'm beginning to wonder if that's true.
Would the Sam you knew have taken this long to complete a removal?
Well, she said there's only one access point,
the lift with the mag key.
Sam's the best operative Byzantium have got.
A lot can happen in a year.
If Sam does anything unusual, anything at all...
..I want you to report it to me. Directly.
You wanted me? Well, here I am.
Here I am!
Who do you work for?
I said, who do you work for?
What the hell happened to you?
  I slipped.
  You slipped?
  Uh huh. Walking down some steps.
Sit.
Just sit.
Hell of a time to go for a walk, Sam.
You do realise we have an operative that needs removal.
Keel wants to know why you haven't executed the order.
Maybe he wants to give it a try.
He's wondering if you've lost your edge.
You tell him Turner keeps the mag key with him 24 7.
Then this mag pick should help.
One way or another, you have to get down there...
and take him out.
And if I don't?
There'll be consequences.
For Byzantium, and for you.
You want to tell me some more about those steps?
Not particularly. No.
And what am I supposed to tell Keel?
Whatever you like.
Look, I will help you if you'll let me.
And I'd let you if I could trust you.
That's good enough.
I'll deal with Hasan.
Watch yourself, Sam.
There's a lot of steps in this city.
I need a name!
He had greying hair, a scar on his cheek.
Really looking forward to working with you.
He's new to the private sector.
I shouldn't be here.
Someone betrayed me. Someone on the team!
Kill me, you'll never find out who wants you dead.
Who do you work for?
I said, who do you work for?
It's OK, it's all right.
Thought you could do with a drink.
That better?
Jack's eldest boy was murdered.
It was Pakis that did it.
Fuck off.
Every time he looks at a bloke like you,
he sees the one that killed his boy.
Course I don't bear you any ill will.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
I admire the way that you tried to take the boy.
It was very professional.
You got me on the back foot, and that's not easy.
I could save you a lot of suffering if you'd let me.
Those fingerprints that we took last night...
We'll get the results back in one or two hours
and then we'll know who you are, where you come from.
And it won't just be you who suffers, it'll be your family.
We'll kill them all.
It's their funeral.
Who we looking at?
That's Dave Ryder.
He's an old buddy of Jack's from his days at the docks.
  Does he have a record?
  Yeah, as long as your arm.
16 counts of bodily harm, arson, extortion,
going back to 1968.
Dave.
Stevie! How's that boy of yours?
Eddie, yeah. He's much better thanks, Dave.
Anything he needs, you just ask.
I know. Appreciate it.
Old man still riding you, is he?
Here he is. Give us a moment, Stevie.
  What?
  I'm saying nothing, am I?
Well, sit yourself down then.
It's that case again.
  You've got to get me something, Zoe.
  Yeah, hold on.
It's not heavy, is it?
That's worth a few hundred million quid, give or take.
I'd rather have the money, myself.
You treat that with respect. It's my future in there...
and yours.
Bingham found anything?
Picked him up last night. Swarthy piece of shit.
You're in your element.
  This is about my grandson.
  Yeah, well, of course it is.
I suppose you want a drink.
Look who's back.
Alex. There you are.
Sorry, were you looking for me?
No, no. Look, your time's your own when Eddie's at school,
but I was getting a bit worried.
I'm sorry, I should've told you.
It wasn't easy, but I found it on the Marylebone High Street.
It's a lot easier than a trip to New York.
Wow, that's so thoughtful of you! I'm sorry.
  I feel like an idiot.
  Who's this, then?
Alex Kent, this is Dave Ryder, he's... He's an old family friend.
Alex is helping us look after Eddie.
  Nice to meet you.
  Nice to meet you, too.
  She's a pretty one, isn't she, Stevie?
  Dave.
Thank you.
We need to know what's in that case.
How're you going to stop him, then?
You'll see.
There he is.
  Where are you going?
  Shortcut.
Mate, that's no entry.
I know. We'll cut him off at the one way system.
Right. Well, how are you going to stop him then, Einstein?
  Watch and learn.
  Whatever.
Oh, for Pete's sake! You blind or something?
You hit me, Granddad.
I hit you?
Cyclists have the right of way.
You hit me!
  I've hurt my back.
  You have, have you?
I can't stand up.
Is this a joke or something?
This is soft tissue damage. I could be suffering for years.
I should wring your neck!
Just give me your insurance information.
  You ran into me, you little wanker!
  You all right there, mate?
  Call the cops, will you, love?
  The hell you will!
  Move it!
  You are a wanker, do you know that?
  Yeah, yeah.
Put that bike away! Idiot.
  Which floor?
  Ground floor, please.
Does Eddie like horseback riding?
Did he mention it?
I found a photo album under his bed.
Mrs Turner used to take him.
He still has a pony at the stable, but he doesn't go.
Not since she died.
You coming?
I thought I'd look for some of his riding things in the basement.
You wanted to see me?
  You're making a bloody fool of yourself.
  I don't know what
you're talking about.
  The girl!
  She tried to leave today because of you.
You're being played, Stevie.
You're cutting me out  
you don't trust me as much as Dave Ryder.
I told you, there's some things you don't need to know.
You told me you wanted me to take over one day.
I'm stronger than you think.
You're strong, are you?
Well, let's see then.
Come on, let's just see how strong you are.
This is the bag of shit who tried to take little Eddie.
You want to show me how strong you are?
Here, take it.
Take it!
Well, now's your chance, son.
Crush his skull in if you want to. You're within your rights.
Well, come on, then!
Do it!
Do it!
I didn't think so.
I didn't bloody think so.
Why d'you do it?
Why?
Where the hell have you been?
It's good to see you, too.
  What's the plan?
  You tell me who tried to kill me.
Mm hmm. After you set me free.
No deal! I ran into your friend, he didn't introduce himself,
so you tell me his name or you die.
I don't know his name. He didn't give it to me.
What did he say to you?
If you came back to Byzantium,
I'd get £100,000 if I gave him your head.
And you didn't think to tell me?
Or Keel?
I'm telling you now. I'd watch yourself, though.
He may have gone to someone else on the team.
We got the results back on his prints  
there's no match anywhere.
This bloke's a ghost.
  What else?
  There is nothing else.
He must've given you a number, a way to contact him.
He said he'd find me, that's all. I'm telling you the truth!
Now cut me loose, for God's sake!
I've got a score of my own to settle...
with whoever set me up.
  Your fingerprints.
  Yeah. Thanks.
She's... She's done it, hasn't she?
Happy now, are you?
You think that, you're a bigger idiot than I thought you were.
  You're late.
  Eddie had trouble sleeping.
What does Turner think happened?
Hasan got loose.
The guard killed him before succumbing to his own injuries.
That'll work.
Didn't you serve together in Afghanistan?
They killed her to get to you, didn't they?
To flush you out.
The longer you stay, the worse it's going to get.
Go, Sam.
Before it's too late.
You're aware we have 32 hours to acquire the bid?
I'm aware.
Help me! He's going to kill me!
You've already lost one of your team, are you willing to lose another?
I'm still looking into how I lost the first one.
You know that tracking device on that case? I've lost the signal.
Make friends, find the case. Do you think you can manage that?
You want me to act like everything is fine,
  when I know it's not.
  Look at it this way...
what choice do you have?
  We need to get you out.
  I'm going nowhere.
  What'll it take for you to trust me again?
  No more excuses,
  no more denials.
  I don't like casualties on my watch.
If you're going to kill me, just get it over with.
