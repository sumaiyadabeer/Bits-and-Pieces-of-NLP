Obama and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, have had
talks at the White House, saying they see eye to eye on every
challenge, but accusations that BP lobbied for the release of the
Lockerbie bomber came to the fore at their joint news conference.
Hillary Clinton has begun the latest stage of her Asian tour with
a visit to South Korea. She called it a real show of solidarity. Her
arrival coincides with the preparations for a large scale
joint naval exercise. Officials in China save the Three
Gorges Dam has withstood its highest flood water levels since it
was completed four years ago. Weeks of floods and landslides have left
several hundred people dead or missing. The flow of water is the
fastest ever recorded. More than three quarters of a
million pounds in bonuses is being paid to senior civil servants and
the Home Office. Over 200 staff will receive a share of the
Â£773,000 bonus pot on top of their salaries, despite the government's
of what had been allocated in bonuses for high earners.
The Ministry of Defence has been told to stop living beyond its
means and manage its finances better. The National Audit Office
said the MoD's failure to manage its budget has led to a change of
plans in contracts, costing hundreds of millions of pounds.
BP has agreed to sell $7 billion worth of assets to pay for the oil
spell. The deal with the American company Apache will raise cash for
this but she $20 billion fund that BP agreed to set up after pressure
from the US government. It includes some of BP's oil and gas operations
in Texas and New Mexico as well as Canada and Egypt.
That's it from me for tonight. Now Belarus seems to have all the
attractions of the Soviet era theme park   the fearsome state
security apparatus and elections were the president's victory is
My Guest today is Andrei Sannikov. Is Belarus about to come in from
Andrei Sannikov, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you. President
Lukashenko has been in power in Belarus since 1994. Has the power
of    the nature of his rule changed in that time? Yes, it's
changed dramatically since 1996. In 1996, he organised a referendum
which gave an absolute power. He destroyed the separation of the
House in Belarus and he started to move very intensively towards
dictatorship. You surprise me. I thought you might tell me that, yes,
there has been some change, and, in the last three to four years,
Lukashenko's rule has evolved and has perhaps moderated. No. There is
no sign of moderation of his rule. There was an attempt to pretend
that the system could change... I would rather say that there was an
attempt to send signals to the West that the dictatorship can change,
that the dictator could be reformed, but nothing happened. I want to
test that. You are opposition figure. Your professional life now
is given over to telling people both inside and outside the country
that there has to be political change. But the fact is that the
most egregious abuses of human rights, as defined by the
international community, in Belarus all came in the period around 1999 
2000. That seems to be when his rule was at its most aggressive,
shall we say. That was probably because we had the most tragic
episodes in our history   the disappearance. The famous case of
the least four people who disappeared. Than one person who
died under vague circumstances, who was the uncontested Leader of the
Opposition at a time. You wouldn't dispute that the disappearances
have reduced in recent years. Thanks to our fight against
dictatorship, unfenced international solidarity, including
Great Britain. You run a charity that has a well run website. The
government does not stop you doing that. We are registered. You cannot
register and organisation is a leap in Dan Norris. But they don't close
you down.    in Belarus. But you know as well as I do that for
security knows full well what you do. The people are being threatened.
My apartment was broken into by the police, and they confiscated
equipment. They confiscated about 67 CDs and discs. The allegedly on
the pretext of my involvement and my wife's involvement in some
criminal case, but they never explain what status I had. Let's
look at the political prisoner issue. No doubt there have been
political prisoners. But the fact is, in 2008, Lukashenko ordered
amnesty and the number of prisoners were released at the time, and the
United States government and others welcomed that move, saying it could
be the beginning of a warmer relationship between the West and
the Belarus government still led by President Lukashenko. It happened
in 2008. Let me be clear on that. It happened only because of the
position of the United States that introduced sanctions to release
political prisoners. It was very morally justified, supported by the
European Union at the time. The only because of that were political
prisoners released. Do you believe that your freedom is currently
directly endangered? I believe it is not safe   I don't believe, I
know what is not safe. But we really have to fight our fight.
yet you have decided that you want to, if you possibly can, fight the
next presidential election. I know there are other opposition leaders
who are free to fight, and who have legal, established, registered
political parties. So what I'm picking up that is this idea that
Lukashenko is the last European dictator, that he will not
countenance any sort of dissidence or political opposition. That does
not actually seen to be the case. It is the case. We will be entering
the presidential race but we will not have access to the most
effective media, like TV and FM stations. All the state owned
newspapers discourage it. We know we will not be allowed to be
present at the election committees. Even international observers will
not be allowed to count the votes. Been the last presidential election
in 2006, the observers from Russia and the CIS states declared it was
free and fair. Russia for some time supported these kinds of dictators
internationally. Lukashenko is a product of Russia. They inevitably
would pronounce any election on the territory of the former Soviet
Union free and fair. Sowing your view they were lying? There were so
many irregularities.    soap in your view. They come, they observed,
and their conclusion is that it was far from free and fur. You are
right that they did have some major criticism for the elections, but
what seems to underpin your answer is the notion that it is
inconceivable that in a free and fair election Mr Lukashenko could
win a majority. I would put it to you that there is substantial
evidence that actually Mr Lukashenko over many years has been
consistently the most popular politician. What kind of evidence?
The most popular politicians   are they supported by the people? Bit
is the same in Belarus. I will try to build on my thesis for you.
People often vote on what they called a pocketbook issues   how
people feel about the economy and their place in it. If you compare
Dan Norris    Belarus with other former members of the Soviet Union,
there is no question that, in the Lukashenko years, Belarus has been
more stable, more economically sustainable, and Belarusians are
substantially better off than those people in neighbouring states.
That's his record. It is the reference point. If you compare it
to Georgia   I compare it to Poland. Let's stick with Ukraine, somewhere
in the middle. It's a direct labour, it's comparable, and, if you look
at the facts, the GDP per capita in your country is 50% higher than
Ukraine. Not any more. I just checked the figures for 2009, the
last figures freely available. Your GDP per capita figure is roughly
nearly $10,000 per person... In Ukraine it is something like 6,800.
It was in 2008 before the change in prices, but you mentioned the word
stability. I could agree to some extent. The salaries, the standard
of living, the quality of living, is very low. That's why I tend to
compare to those that are comparable, like Poland. Maybe in
Lithuania and Latvia. They have taken gigantic steps after they
started to joins the European Union. Belarus has great potential   we
are much smaller countries than Ukraine. We don't have problems
like other countries   ethnic problems, religious problems   and
after we acquire freedom, hopefully next year, we will move forward
quickly. You have begun to make the case for membership of the European
Union. I want to talk to about the European Union at some length.
Before that, let's have a look at Lukashenko and his achievements, or
not, as the case may be. You and the opposition have said he has run
the economy into the ground, that it is dysfunctional. Let's look at
the fact. He has just signed a major deal with the Chinese
government which promises $15 billion of credit and investment
from Beijing. The figure that dwarfs previous support from the
IMF. They think this will be transformative for Belarus. He is
looking in the right direction, isn't he? I will believe it when I
see it. Whenever he goes to, for example, the United Arab Emirates,
or Venezuela, he always claims, or his people claim, they brought back
billions of dollars, and everybody forgets about it. We don't have any
press to control these statements. He is now on a very difficult
situation. You can't deny the reality of privatisations, for
example. You talk about the demand economy and Lukashenko being the
product of the bad old Soviet times, but the fact is, this year alone,
he has promised to privatise 150 state enterprises. It's promises.
But we have already seen privatisation. You get upset
because so many of them have handed power to Russian companies. It is
not a matter of handing power to Russian companies. The problem it
is not transparent, it is not controlled, and we don't know how
it is being done, would that it is being done at all. An economist, an
opposition figure himself, says the fact is that somebody like you  
there is no way on earth that you could actually get to the 100,000
signatures necessary to get your name and the next ballot paper. He
says you don't have that kind of I don't know where you got that
quotation but it's possible it was done before. I see people visiting
different places in the country. There are name is in favour of
their    the person offering the alternative to Lukashenko. If let's
talk about the strategic picture and less about the politics of the
internal situation. Russia is vital to Belarus. For a time, it seemed
as if Lukashenko's intention was to work towards a union, a full state
union with Russia. That has been put on the back burner and
relations between Lukashenko and Moscow are poorer. What do you
believe Moscow's intention is to award Belarus? I think they're
disappointed, to put it mildly, with Lukashenko. He does not keep
his promises. I'm not commenting on those promises. I think the way
that he cheated Russia for so long and that they spend the $37.5
billion over six years to subsidise Lukashenko and support his vision,
and it ended between    with a war between Lukashenko and the Kremlin.
They're thinking differently now which is why you have gone out of
your way to cosy up to Moscow, is that what you're doing? I will say
what I have always said, strategic priorities, the EU... you were
quoted in Newsweek magazine, you said you would be ready to embrace
Russian help if it comes from the right people. I was misquoted, I
would never say the word embrace. I said I was ready to seriously
negotiate with Russia on any problem they have. Taking into
account national interests. want the Russians, you want Moscow
to give you help in your effort to change the regime in Minsk. I want
to open their eyes and long then to see this regime hampers process in
the entire region. To get this Russian help, to do what you
believed to be right, what are you prepared to give Moscow? Moscow
wants the Belarus government to recognise the independence of
Southall said here, are you prepared to do that? No. That would
not be in line with our national interests. What about Russia
getting its way when it comes to Pipelines and oil and gas deals and
the right sort of deals with the Belarus government in the future
when it comes to the energy industry. Will you help Moscow?
am prepared to negotiate with Moscow because what is going on
today... it is not in our national interests. When you use the slogan
about a European Belarus, are you, once and for all, putting an end to
the long term prospect of a union between Belarus and Russia?
never existed. Yes it did, there was the idea, we saw the passport
and customs integrated. The idea was that, over time, you would
integrate. It existed on paper. is that over? Belarus will not go
down that track? Begin the interest of    it is not in the interests of
either country. Moscow is changing. You have had that to direct from Mr
Putin, have you? I have not, I have had it from analysts. Look
seriously at Mr Putin, look at the way he still is perhaps the most
important politician in Russia today. Do you think Russia's notion
of what is in its national interests have changed?
emphasis is on the economy. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a
legitimate but they will not reach their goals in Belarus. Under
Lukashenko it impossible because he is solely of    for the
preservation of his own power. That is why I think Russia will accept
this notion, if they stop thinking in the Soviet past. Moving towards
Europe will save Russia a headache of what to restore, what to do with
the past and what to do with people who want to go back to the Soviet
era. When I hear you talk, I cannot help having a vision of the farmers
of Belarus or the factory workers, listening to you, an intellectual,
a man who has good political contacts, Human Rights contacts in
the UK and the US, across western Europe. They are going to see you
as somebody who does not represent them. They are Slavic, they have a
long relationship with Moscow and Russia. If you look at the opinion
polls, a slight majority, if forced to make a choice, would choose to
join Russia rather than the EU. You are out of step to    step with
many of your people. It depends on how you put the question to them.
They have good relations about 50%. To join Russia as a region, no,
only 3%. Are you really in touch with your own people? You have more
friends in the West than in Minsk. I travel extensively through the
country now. Irrespective leak of politics, I talked to people of   
I talk to people all over the world. You are a strong critic of
Lukashenko now but let's not forget that in 1994, 1995, you were a
loyal servant of that government, you were making his case on the
world stage. You have made a transformation. People might wonder
about that. It was not a transformation. I was not on his
team. I resigned in protest against this referendum and the policies.
It was a step that I did not work     know what I would do after that.
They tried to postpone my resignation but I insist on doing
it on the eve of the referendum. I said to Lukashenko I am a career
diplomat. 16 years later, we have already alluded to this
presidential election which must happen by 2011. Do you believe that,
this time around, Lukashenko is prepared to give the opposition
more space and is prepared to accept the result, even if it is
one which goes against him? I'm not. He will fight for his power because
it is the sole purpose that moves him. Not the national interest or
the well being of the people. I'm not naive to think we will have a
free and fair election. Street protests will be unavoidable.
is what I wanted to end on. You have said, in the past, elections
will not solve Belarus's problems. In the end it is the people who are
tired of repression who will solve the problems. You are calling, in a
sense, for revolution. You have seen other revolutions across the
former Soviet empire. You want one of those, don't you? I would not
call it revolution. I would call it something different. It is the only
way to express our views, going to the streets. This pressure,
demonstration, will allow us access to TV and radio. It will be
different but I am not naive and neither is any body in that
position. We don't have a normal environment for the election. We
have to use our chance. I have not seen a huge amount of people
agitating in Minsk, looking as if they're ready to undertake a street
revolution. Why do you believe it will happen? You have not seen them
but I can tell you that there are people in the street on the 16th of
the month, Belarus Solidarity Day. It is risking their lives every
time they come out on the streets. Here you are, in London, talking to
politicians and people across the West. Do you think they're doing
enough for Belarus? I do not think there are doing enough. They don't
realise the dangers of this regime which are apparent to us. How long
will it take to get a free Belarus? Where will it look when it is free,
to the west door to the east? hope we will become free next year.
Next year, you are an optimist. I hope we will be ready to join the
EU. Improved relations with Russia and strategic partnership with
Russia also. Andrei Sannikov, thank you for being on HARDtalk. Thank
Hello. Further rain is set to affect the north of the UK into
in the last 12 hours and there are more to come, but the emphasis will
switch further north throughout the night. Later on the showers will
move into the south west. We have a weather front sitting to the north
of the UK that will gradually ease its way further north, up into
central and eastern Scotland as Wednesday progresses. It is looking
like it will produce some heavy rain across the South west of
Scotland in time for the rush hour. 60 80 millimetres could be yours.
Further south, a quiet start to the day, 19 degrees in London at 8am.
The south west will see longer sunny spells first thing that they
will not last. There are some showers gathering towards the West
which will make their way inland as the morning goes on. Sunshine will
get the day under way throughout much of Wales. Northern Ireland
will experience dry weather but the rain will increase through the
morning and it will turn heavy at times although it's not likely to
be as heavy for Northern Ireland as it is in the south east and later
in the south west. Pretty persistent that rain, as you can
see, that rain in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Sunny spells on
Tuesday but the chance of sharp, thundery showers for Wales and the
south west of England. Through Wednesday evening and overnight
into Thursday, the weather front towards the North starts to give up
the ghost and we will see that fizzle out as Thursday goes on.
Towards the south of the UK, the shower activity is set to pep up.
For England and Wales there will be an increasing chance of rain. Many
areas crying out for rain but the areas that need it most are not in
line for it. East Anglia and the south east will remain dry on
