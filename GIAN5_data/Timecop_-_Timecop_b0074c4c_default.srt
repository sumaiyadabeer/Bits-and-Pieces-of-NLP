This film contains very strong language.
Whoa.
  Mornin'.
  Mornin'.
Y'all mind stepping aside?
You know what I think?
No, sir. I don't.
I think you got a shipment of gold in that wagon...
you're bringing to General Lee.
Just who might you be?
A friend of the Confederacy.
I'd be most happy to. Except first...
I'd like you to give me the gold.
I don't think I heard you.
I think you did.
I'd like that gold.
It ain't very nice here as you can plainly see.
I don't know what y'all are about.
If you don't step aside, I'll kill you.
You wanna die in this weather, that's your choice.
I'm gonna ask one more time.
Would you PLEASE give me the gold?
Good afternoon, Senators.
The President is grateful for your time.
This is a matter of great importance and the utmost secrecy.
Cut the shit, George.
You're here to ask for money, so come on and ask for it.
I am gonna ask you for money...
and you're gonna give it to me.
You remember Dr Hans Kleindast?
He helped us during the space programme.
The past 20 years, he's been in hiding, doing research.
His research has been time travel.
Time travel.
Time travel.
  Well, beam me up, Scotty.
  Very funny, Senator.
  You want to know what's funnier?
  You're gonna tell us.
Funny thing is, the doctor did it.
I thought that'd get your attention. He did it.
The technology is in the folders in front of you.
You can't go forward to the future.
You can go back, but things get real tricky.
If you go back and change something, it's catastrophic.
Like making ripples in water, only these are time ripples.
You can't kill Hitler, much as we'd like to.
It could cause a chain reaction
that could alter mankind.
That is where you come in.
We have to form an agency to police this technology, to protect time.
We'll call it the Time Enforcement Commission   TEC.
Commander Eugene Matuzak is our choice to run it.
How much is it gonna cost?
  A lot.
  How much is a lot?
More than a little.
Not a good time to ask for money. The economy...
A competitor could go back and invent the computer or plane.
You wanna talk about the American economy?
Say Saddam Hussein finances a trip to 1944?
He gets our technology and Iraq has the atomic bomb.
Oh, you like that one.
  Not bad.
  There's already been a ripple.
The CIA broke up an arms sale to terrorists.
Ordinarily, such news doesn't make the President's desk.
But the purchase was made with gold bullion.
It was dated 1863, and stamped "The Confederate States of America".
We had it carbon tested. It's real.
Think about what I'm saying.
Going back in time is a way to make money.
Our committee would have exclusive jurisdiction?
Yours alone.
No one can know. It's too dangerous.
That's very good, George.
Personally, I think it sounds like that bullshit Star Wars programme.
But you'll get your money. Anyone here wanna oversee it?
Yeah, I'll do it.
Ah, young Senator McComb.
Why not?
You'll like him. Like you, except his dorsal fin's bigger.
There's never enough time.
Never enough for what?
To satisfy a woman.
Then you never wanna miss an opportunity.
Are you busy?
I'm meeting my husband.
If I were him, I would not keep you waiting.
If he's not here when I turn around,
I'll go home with you.
You'll do.
I didn't hear you this morning.
It was early. I met Matuzak.
You gonna take that job?
  What?
  Be right back.
Read it.
Wolverine.
Between the lines.
I should get out of here.
Good.
You know that purse?
Doesn't look good on you.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Smart kid. He read my mind.
With your English, he has no choice.
I know all the good words.
You didn't answer my question.
  Are you taking this job?
  I think so.
Is this TEC thing dangerous?
I don't bake cookies for a living.
Will you have to travel?
Not the way you think.
Pictures bring back memories.
You're gonna be very happy you have this.
Why?
I can see into the future.
You can see the future?
What do you see?
I see it's gonna rain.
We both have the afternoon off.
Why don't we go and practise the words you like so much?
Max?
What?
I have something to tell you.
Shit, I'm sorry.
Don't answer it.
  Just this once, don't answer it.
  I have to.
Walker.
Now?
Oh, Jesus Christ. Can you find somebody else?
Somebody called in sick and...
There's only you to keep the streets safe.
I don't have a choice.
  Of course you have a choice.
  This is what I do.
I know that's what you do.
It's just things are different now.
What are you talking about?
This isn't the way I wanted to do this.
I have to go.
  There's something to tell me?
  Yes.
Can you wait until I get back?
Sure.
Surprise.
Aaaah!
Max!
  Max!
  Melissa!
Max!
Finish him.
  Who are you?
  You're a smart boy.
Sleep on it a while.
Max!
Max!
Close enough. That's it. Close enough.
Break it up. There's nothing to see.
Go back to work. Come on.
Come on, now.
Break it up. Go back to work.
Come on. Get outta here.
Good morning, Mr Atwood.
Good morning, Charlie.
It's a terrible day, sir.
What's goin' on?
Mr Floatbauer. He went off the roof.
Well, shit happens.
Excuse me.
Good morning, Pete.
Good morning, Mr Atwood.
Third jumper this week.
Carries on, you'll be out of a job.
Only goin' down, sir.
Mr Atwood. Isn't it terrible?
Tragic.
"Let's Misbehave" by Irving Aaronson
  Get me Ross.
Ross, hi.
I want another 100,000 shares of Middle States Oil.
No, just buy it. It's an act of faith.
I think things are gonna turn around.
I got a feeling about the future.
I gotta go. I'm very busy.
Walker.
How have you been, Lyle?
  How you doin', partner?
  Ex partner.
Max.
I'm not gonna change a thing.
The only ripples are in my pool.
You couldn't do this by yourself. Who are you working for?
I'm not hurtin' anybody.
I'm just taking an opportunity.
I've got to take you back.
I went ten rounds with John L Sullivan himself.
I saw Tyson beat Spinks on TV.
Mr Atwood... Oh, my God!
Doesn't look too good, Lyle.
I'll stay here. I won't go back.
Who sent you?
Like it'll make a difference.
This guy's gonna run the country.
He'll get the money from somewhere.
I can't tell you. He'll wipe out my grandparents.
My mother, my father, my wife, my kids! My fucking cat!
You heard the name Aaron McComb?
Senator McComb?
Bullshit.
He's gonna be President.
He's doin' this to get money for his campaign.
He already owns most of the guys we work with.
When we get back, you'll point them out.
You're out of your mind. He's gonna roll over you.
  We'll see. Let's go.
  Listen to me.
If I go back and talk, my family is dead.
I'm talking about my... my family.
If I die here, it's only me.
I can't go back.
I have to bring you back.
I have no choice.
Neither do I.
Holy Mother of Mary!
Testify, I'll do what I can.
You are charged with violations of TEC code 40.8.
Time travel with intent to alter the future.
The charges are compounded by your status as TE officer.
Do you have a statement?
Tell her.
Have you something to say?
Yes.
No.
Sentence is mandated by our charter.
Say something. Come on, say something.
You have been found guilty.
Take care of yourself, Max.
..death, to be carried out immediately.
Poor bastard.
Tomorrow might've been a brighter day.
We're pickin' up noise outside Camp David, '79.
It's an Iranian kill team.
Their third try this year.
CIA are locating the facility.
I want two teams, before and after this date.
LA, 1902. Somebody's buying up Beverly Hills for chump change.
Burr and Swain got the duty. You look like shit.
  We have to talk.
  In a minute.
  Now.
  I said in a minute.
Go over your notes and check with me before you launch.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Senator Nelson, TEC Director Matuzak.
He's on the Oversight Committee.
He'd like to see how our budget is being spent.
Senator McComb, our Committee Chairman,
took time out of his campaign to join us.
Senator.
A pleasure to show you around.
Are these all of your agents?
Most of them. Agent Monroe, Anderson.
Agents Burr, Bartolo and Shepherd.
  Agent Walker.
  Agent Walker.
I've heard a great deal about you.
I've heard a lot about YOU.
Not all of it bad I hope.
Agent Walker has had a successful mission.
Congratulations, Agent Walker.
Director, to the launch room.
I'll show you where we kick off.
Can Agent Walker accompany us?
I'd love to hear about his mission.
I have a report to file.
Agent Walker would be delighted.
We've spared every expense.
No comforts, no necessities.
Your latest mission, who were you after?
A man named Atwood. Ring a bell?
No. Should that name be familiar to me?
Unfortunately, Atwood was a TEC agent.
That's one of the dangers of having an agency like this.
Imagine the dangers of NOT having it.
Did you know this Atwood?
He was my partner.
I'm sorry. Nothing worse than a rogue cop.
Except the guy who paid him.
If there is such a guy.
There always is.
Do you know who the man is?
Oh, yeah.
  Why don't you arrest him?
  I lost my witness.
I trust you'll keep working on it.
You can bet on it.
We use the Parker Datalink Systems, utilising the super conducting chip.
Senator McComb was Jack Parker's partner.
Sold out before getting the patent on that chip.
Bad luck.
My deal with Parker is not important.
What IS important is the dangers of this programme.
You've got MY vote.
Excuse me, what dangers?
Dishonest agents, like Atwood.
Agents risk contacting a past version of themselves.
That could be a disaster.
Why is that?
Same matter can't occupy the same space.
However, it's NEVER happened.
What I propose accomplishes the same thing.
Prevent time travel rather than spending money policing it.
I must get back to the Hill.
Malcolm, this is a project we could do without.
I hope you vote against appropriations.
I admire your dedication, Agent Walker.
I hope you get your man.
I never quit.
The poll result trends aren't encouraging,
but there are good things to utilise.
Suburb support is good
but poor in urban areas.
You're gaining with the Death Penalty Coalition...
and with the Americans Anti Immigration faction.
We've estimated a budget based on costs until election day.
It's big. I don't see how you can raise it in time.
Lawrence, I love you.
I really do. But don't tell me what I can't do.
Television wins elections.
Not the press, not endorsements. Not even truth. You need MONEY.
So, how much is it gonna cost
to buy the network time I need?
Walker has cost me that much.
I need a chat with him, a chat he'll remember.
Handsome devil, isn't he?
He's not my type.
What did you want to talk about?
What do you know about him?
Capable of eating his young.
Seemed interested in YOU this afternoon.
He interests ME.
Atwood named him.
You're shittin' me.
He's the one who sent him back.
Why didn't he testify?
His family would be killed.
He said McComb has half the Agency. I believe him.
Doesn't have me.
I said, he doesn't have me.
Well, fuck you too.
He'll close the Agency, then no one stops him going back.
This one is mine.
He's a Presidential candidate.
You accuse him, you better have enough evidence.
You believe me?
I always believe you but you're not always right.
Come over to the house for dinner.
Carol would love to see you.
Thanks. Some other time.
You're allowed a life. I read it in a manual.
If I cannot go back to save her, this scumbag
is not going back to steal money.
Go home, Max.
If you won't come to mine,
go to yours.
When I said "McComb hasn't bought me",
you were supposed to say, "I know that."
I know that.
'System initialized.'
'Destination, please?' Home.
'There are no new messages.'
Television.
Play tape.
It's going to look like this when I'm finished.
See? Very nice.
'Victorian Villa. Deluxe birdhouse.'
This thing is gonna be bigger than our house.
Want some help?
'Want some help?'
You can buy the birdseed. OK.
'Divide these parts into groups to determine their function.'
I should buy more videotapes.
You gotta be in the mood to do this.
You were just a second ago.
I think I should start
with something easier to put together.
'Huh? Honey?'
Maybe you should lay out the parts first.
I think I wanna try from memory.
Find part A and work from there.
'Controversy over Government provided funds is in the news.
'The White Supremacist Party received funds.
'Groups called for the abolition of this practice.
Senator McComb's fading Presidential bid'
was denied matching funds.
Sources indicate the Senator is out of money
and may withdraw from the race.
'Independent leaders claim that the denial
'will bolster their Presidential campaign.
'Polls show Elgin Michaels trailing by only six points...'
'There are no new messages.'
Aaahhh!
Who are you?
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
50,000 volts, motherfucker.
Have a nice day.
Walker?
Walker?
My name's Fielding. Internal Affairs.
He messed up my apartment. You can kill him.
You've got some more inside.
  Everybody, freeze!
  I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
Get in there.
You, he's under arrest. They're all under arrest.
Assault, attempted murder, makin' a mess.
I can have the door removed.
I had company this morning.
McComb sent them.
Did they say that?
I said that. What does IA want?
They're not convinced you can be trusted.
She's not following me around.
Take the phase four.
Send somebody else.
  I wanna be where McComb is.
  A refresher course in etiquette.
I'm the Director.
I authorise missions and assignments.
Damn it! This agency isn't dead yet!
With you here, it will be.
Fielding, get in here!
She'll get in my way.
She'll stay behind you. You got an hour until launch.
  You're not funny.
  I'm never funny.
Yeah?
'Disturbance has risen to six.'
Dammit, Ricky,
  fuck this machine again, I'll break your neck.
  Sorry.
Looks like safe sex to me.
  Show me.
  OK, here we go.
The ripple was at four, then passed five to six.
Looks like it set off Waimea.
Somebody's done a number. We've located the point of origin.
It's right here in Washington.
Shit. Come on. You're outta here.
You should have an exhibit.
Oh, really?
All my best stuff's at home.
I could care less if you like me or not.
But you don't know a thing about me.
I've been with IA for two years.
I'm field rated in weapons and tactics. Impressed?
I'm blown away.
I read the Atwood file.
You didn't mention you could read.
You asked to go after a friend.
He crossed the line.
Or he crossed YOU.
'Launch sequence activated.
'Authorized personnel only in the area.'
She looks like the Vollmers.
'We are at T minus two minutes.'
Why's everyone nervous?
If the launch goes wrong, they have to scrape the wall.
You DO look like the Vollmer twins.
Who are the Vollmer twins?
'Launch personnel only in the bay.
'T minus one minute. 30 seconds and counting.'
'Magnetic field initiation in ten seconds.
'Telemetry check initiated.'
Are we gonna blast to the past!
Yeeehaaaw!
Launch.
I've done simulated launches but I never noticed the wall before.
  Simulated?
  It's my first real launch.
Don't put your head out the window.
  She's a little shaky.
  Blood pressure's sky high. Pulse is 140.
If she farts, she'll fly.
Fielding, concentrate on something relaxing during a launch.
What do you think about?
  Not swallowing my tongue.
  How's Walker?
  We're not sure if he's awake.
  He's awake.
'T minus 30 seconds,
Have they lost a pod during launch?
  Ask the Vollmers.
  Where are they?
See those two red spots?
Oh, God.
'Eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one, zero.'
Aaahhh!
Aaaaaahhhh!
They're away.
Is this the hottest thing or what?
Goddamn, Ricky!
So much for a dry run.
We're alive.
Are we where we're supposed to be?
Give me a date.
Sunday, October 9th, 1994.
Target.
We're close.
October 9th?
I'll be 16 tomorrow.
Where?
I was living in Colorado. Man, this is weird.
Don't try to visit yourself.
I'd like to tell myself not to sleep with Bobby Morgan after my party.
A smart woman would call Bobby and give him some advice.
Oh, yeah. Right.
How long was Atwood your partner?
Three years.
Was it difficult to bring him back?
What do you think?
Have you got a family?
Mine's still in Colorado.
My dad said that time travel was a bigger threat than the bomb.
He's right.
The whole world should enjoy the weekend
and not worry if the planet is there on Monday.
You sound like a woman I knew.
Someone remarkable, I hope.
Yeah.
Someone you knew? Where is she?
She was killed.
Sorry. You must've thought of going back to change that.
We're here.
I thought it was just Parker Datalink.
Take the back and wait for my call.
Keep your head down. Tomorrow's your birthday.
I have a problem.
  You do?
  Let me tell you what it is.
I can't keep paying for this.
It doesn't matter to me.
It should matter to you.
The company's going into bankruptcy.
The chip is the future of this company.
If you don't agree, walk away.
We've had this conversation before.
Come up with the money and I'm out of here.
I can't afford it.
But I found a banker with faith in the future.
Take it.
You've got no faith in the company, I've got none in you.
If I were you, I wouldn't cash that cheque.
It'll cost you more than you'll ever know.
Hey, Jack.
It's been a while.
What is this?
It's me.
Well, it's...
it's him.
No, it's us.
Where did you come from?
Are you his father?
Do I look that old?
I'm a United States Senator. Hurting me is a Federal offence.
I don't know anything about...
Will you stop it? Just stop it.
I remember having bigger balls.
I'm gonna have to get this fixed.
Don't touch me!
Same matter can't occupy the same space.
Same matter?
So, you got a special NSA briefing coming up.
Secret session.
That's not for another week.
"Time travel", someone says.
Gets a big laugh.
Oh, Christ, you're me.
How far back have you come?
Never interrupt me when I'm talking to myself.
We're gonna take them.
What's the signal?
You were a visionary. The computer market was saturated.
Your coldware revolutionises the industry.
I made a mistake.
So, I changed my mind.
Now!
Freeze!
Agent Walker.
How inappropriate. Do I look frozen to you?
You look like shit. Get away from him.
Move! Drop the guns. Now.
The track and return module.
Throw it to me.
You gonna leave me back here?
Do it!
I wanna see how you get down here and keep the gun on us.
You gonna jump?
That's how the Vollmers would do it.
Move back. Give me the envelope.
Thank you.
The country's falling apart.
We need a President who's so rich, he answers to nobody.
  What's that?
  He was having a fundraiser.
When I'm in office, the top 10% will get richer...
the other 90% can emigrate to Mexico.
Are you going or staying?
I think you plan too far ahead.
Obviously you don't.
Anything else to mention?
Don't tell anyone I killed you.
OK, let's finish up and get out of here.
I'm voting for my President.
Good to see you, Jack.
Maybe he'll calm down after the election.
What's the big deal?
Point it. Pull the trigger.
Boom! Somebody dies.
Get up there!
Get the module!
Will you get him?
Damn it!
Uuuhhh!
Aaron.
Come here.
You own the company.
The chip is going to be worth billions. MY billions.
Now, read this.
Oh oh.
Just read it. And do what it says.
Now, you get out of here.
And do me a favour   lay off the fucking candy bars.
Have a nice day.
I should've said "freeze".
I think he got the idea.
Do me a favour. Don't give up easily.
Never crossed my mind.
Aaahhh!
I don't want to fight a woman.
Then don't.
Changed my mind.
He's gonna kill your family?
Don't you leave me!
Who're you talking to?
Stay here, Walker.
In my future, you're dead.
What the hell's going on here?
They're tearing up the tracks.
McComb?
Who else?
He hasn't got the power.
He's way ahead in the polls.
The Senate committee caved in.
They wanna be on the good side of the new boss.
What's the matter?
When I left, nothing had happened.
Hey, Walker, you get the pod as a memento.
He's changed the future.
What are you talkin' about?
McComb.
He's buying the Presidency.
It's been done before.
The guy's a killer.
He killed my agency.
  He shot two people.
  Who?
A guy named Parker. And Fielding.
  Do I know them?
  You sent Fielding with me.
I don't like him. But I can't sell a story
without a smoking gun and 50 witnesses?
How about one?
  You don't count.
  There is a chance she's still alive.
Who?
Fielding. The cops were there.
I'm looking for a new job.
It won't help me if I try to put the President in jail.
Do you think I'm making this up?
You're not going back.
If she's alive, we've got him.
We're shut down. We're history.
Wait, I'm gonna show you something.
You come with me.
Those files are sealed. I don't know why I'm doin' this.
You say you were my best friend?
For a long time.
I liked you?
Oh, yeah.
What are you lookin' for?
Fielding's friends and family in 1994.
  Who was she?
  IA. She had a deal with McComb.
He's got to go back to be sure she's dead.
Since we're close friends, answer me this question.
How's McComb making expeditions to the past
without our equipment?
The prototype was never dismantled.
Kleindasts. It's in Calverton, Maryland.
Short drive from Washington.
We've no authority to get in there.
What about Ricky?
If you were my friend, you wouldn't do this.
If he's back, he's already told the story to Matuzak.
God knows who else.
They won't listen but they'd notice
if he comes up dead. He'll have to be erased.
  Erased.
  Have him killed before he joined TEC.
That way nobody ever knew him.
Perfect.
It's not perfect.
But it's all we've got.
Don't expect to be my Chief of Staff if you turn into a snivelling moron.
Well, what do you know?
Random intervals. Maryland Utilities shows demands identical to ours.
Send me back.
We can't do that.
Stay out of it, Ricky.
Can you call me Richard?
Richard, do I have a best friend?
It isn't me. Maybe Gordon.
I remember all my best friends.
Gordon doesn't fit. I'm not saying you do.
But, for now, I'll believe you.
  Where are you goin'?
  To vent the fuel shunts.
Wait while I get author...
Was I your only friend?
A launch is not a one man operation.
I know.
  If I'm off on velocity, you'll be an omelette.
  You tryin' to scare me?
  Yeah.
  Hit the right year.
I'll see you.
I've eaten your wife's goulash.
Too much salt.
Here goes the pension.
'Emergency launch systems override warning.'
'Manual launch initiation alert.'
Shut it down! Now!
'Ignition firing command activated.
'Launch on full manual.'
Last chance!
Damn it.
Get me the police computer.
I want all Jane Does admitted to hospitals on October 9th.
Check for Jane Does with multiple gunshot wounds.
Gotcha.
Police. Jane Doe.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Get me anything?
  What do you want?
  I wanna go home.
I know who wins the next ten World Series.
No problem.
Why d'you come back?
I need you to testify against McComb.
It would be my pleasure.
  It could be dangerous.
  I know that.
McComb has made some changes.
The TEC and Matuzak never heard of you.
Can't be. I had the training for six years.
  I have friends.
  I've got to move fast.
If I can find you, so can he.
What can I do?
I need proof that you existed.
In case I don't make the trip.
They took some blood.
It would be in the lab.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
I really screwed up.
Yes, you did.
I wanna make things right.
You may find you can make things right for yourself.
I'll be right back.
Melissa.
I'll take you some place safe.
What are you doing?
Help! Security!
Help! Security! Somebody call Security!
Help!
Hey!
Hold it! Don't move!
Aaahhh!
Pictures bring back memories.
This is for what you're GOING to do.
Melissa, don't turn around.
What's wrong?
It's OK.
Listen.
  Who are you?
  It's me.
Look, it's Max.
Max, what happened?
I can't tell you now.
We have to go. Trust me.
Trust me.
Let's go.
Here! Here!
Stop it! Please!
Tell me what happened.
Try to believe me.
I love you. Trust me.
You're not Max.
It's me.
Ten years from now.
That's not possible.
Remember Matuzak? The new job?
  Time travel.
  Time travel?
If I need a birdhouse built, I know who to talk to.
Oh, my God.
It's me, it's Max.
I can't believe this.
Try.
What am I like ten years from now?
Just like now.
Perfect.
You time travelled.
Why?
Let me show you.
You have something special to tell him.
How do you know that?
I've just told you.
What are you here to prevent?
Changes in the past.
Why? What's going to happen?
Later.
Stay and meet with him.
Don't tell him anything.
There's never enough time.
Never enough for what?
To satisfy a woman.
Then you never want to miss an opportunity.
Are you busy?
I'm meeting my husband.
Senator McComb? Sir?
That message came from the Senate operator.
You have a four o'clock...
Clear my schedule. All of it.
Yes, sir.
Have you ever been inside the President's limo?
No, sir.
You keep in touch.
I'll send you a photograph of it.
I have something I wanna tell you.
  Oh, shit.
  Don't answer it.
I have to.
You did not tell him?
He didn't give me a chance.
You should've tried.
Are we still together in ten years?
Yes, we're together.
Do you have a picture?
No. Nothing recent.
Am I dead?
No, you're not dead.
What about tomorrow?
Everything is going to be fine.
Why can't we just run away from whatever it is?
They would come back as many times as it takes.
It has to end tonight.
Hurry. Keep him upstairs.
Whatever you do, keep him upstairs.
Just do what I say.
Please. Go.
Max, I don't want you to go.
I'll be back soon.
I'm...
I'm pregnant.
Great.
I love you.
Surprise.
  Who the fuck are you?
  Family friend.
Don't go down.
Upstairs.
How did you miss him?
He was a TEC cop.
Son of a bitch doesn't know how to die.
If you don't kill him, you don't go back.
Upstairs.
Max.
Oh, my God, Max. Look out!
Max!
You have nothing soft to land on.
  Go! Go!
  I'll get help.
Say "ahh".
Oh, shit.
Whoa, that's gotta hurt.
  Lousy night to be out.
  Don't hurt her.
You were at a disadvantage from the beginning.
I'm an ambitious visionary.
I deserve to be the most powerful man in the world.
You're an idiot. The place for that fancy kicking is on Broadway.
  Thanks for clearing that up.
  I'm way ahead in the polls.
The biggest landslide since '72.
It's reassuring to know what the future holds.
That's C 4.
It will separate every part of you
from every other part of you.
Let her go. You've got me.
Agent Walker is too visible.
But OFFICER Walker, dead, is just another statistic.
When he's gone, you're gone.
Where's the younger one?
  He's dead.
  If he were dead, HE would not be here.
Get him.
Let her go.
Aaarrrggghhh!
What do you want?
You're a bright boy. Sleep on it.
I did that.
It's different now. Happens when you change time.
Lines of confluence. Probability scales.
Put your gun on the floor.
What were you going to do? Shoot me?
The bomb's gonna go off any second.
We'll be dead. I'll win by default.
My young self will be President.
And like before, you can't save your wife.
She died because of your changes.
Now YOU'RE fucking with time.
  You're as bad as me.
  Wrong. I'm setting it right.
I hate doing things twice.
But, I don't see another option.
I do.
What are you doing here?
You called me. You left a message.
I didn't leave any message.
Don't argue among yourself. I left it.
Now nobody's got a future.
OK. There's a real mess now.
I hope you're happy. This is a real mess.
A simple murder has turned into a bloodbath.
You get out of here.
Go, now! Go!
Aaahhh!
  You two should be closer.
  Keep him away from me.
Same matter, same space.
I'm still kicking. I'm on Broadway.
Aaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!

'Launch bay alert is terminated.'
'Maintenance to the core chamber.'
Hey, where you goin'?
What happened to you?
What are you talkin' about?
You're walking around.
I've been doing that since I was two.
Is that abnormal?
  What's goin' on with Senator McComb?
  Senator McComb?
Don't act like you're out of your head.
  I've got a blank spot.
  You've got a hole in your head.
Ten years ago, McComb left his office.
Nobody's seen him since.
That's so sad. I... I remember.
What are you hangin' around for?
This time stay away from trouble.
Do I know you?
I guess not.
Hey!
'Destination, please.' Home.
Dad!
Mom said you'd barbecue hot dogs.
Yeah.
  What kind of day did you have?
  Busy.
You all right?
Great.
Good.
Come here.
I have something to tell you.
Take your time. I'm not going anywhere.
I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Without love
Without love
Gotta get you back inside of my arms
Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey.
