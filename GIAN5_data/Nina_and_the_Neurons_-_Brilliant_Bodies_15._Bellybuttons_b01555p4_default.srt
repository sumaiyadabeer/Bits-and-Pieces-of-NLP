Hi, there! This button fell off my lab coat yesterday,
so I've just been sewing it back on.
There! Good as new.
I hear a beep, I see a flash, I wonder what they're going to ask.
Hi, Nina!
Hi, guys!
  We've got a question for you.
  What are bellybuttons for?
A great question, what are bellybuttons for?
I've often wondered about that.
Why don't you come down to the lab and we'll investigate?
  See you soon, Nina! Bye!
  Bye!
I need some help to answer this one and I know just who to ask.
OK, Neurons, time to get to work.
Neurons at the ready, Nina!
Today's question is, what are bellybuttons for?
Which Neuron do you think will be most useful in finding the answer?
  Me!
  Me!
  Me!
  Me!
  Me!
  Me!
Will it be...Fabulous Felix?
I can help so very much, if you need the sense of touch.
Will it be...Beautiful Belle?
I send messages to brain from ear, if there's a sound I help you hear.
Will it be...Lovely Luke?
For looking and seeing day or night, I help you with your sense of sight.
Will it be...Awesome Ollie?
If it's pongy but you can't tell, my messages help your sense of smell.
Or will it be...Baby Bud?
Sour, salty, bitter or sweet, I'm your taste buddy when you eat.
It's Luke!
Yes!
Go, Luke! Go, Luke! Go, Luke! Go, Luke!
Go, Luke! Go, Luke! Go, Luke!
Cool, Nina, I'll be looking out to help you.
Today's question   what are bellybuttons for?
Since our bellybutton is something we see,
Luke, our sight Neuron, will help us today.
Stand by, Neurons, I may need help from all of you.
I need to get the lab ready before the experimenters arrive.
Izzy likes rainbows, Kaleel like basketball and Laney loves drawing,
but they all want to know what bellybuttons are for,
so today, for one day only,
Izzy, Kaleel and Laney become the experimenters!
  Hi, guys!
  Hi, Nina!
Welcome to my science lab!
Now you asked, what are our bellybuttons for,
which is a great question, but why do you want to know?
My bellybutton doesn't seem to do anything.
Do the rest of you have bellybuttons?
  Yes.
  Yes, we do.
What, all of you?
  Yes!
  I'm joking, I've got a belly button too.
We're going to investigate to find out more about bellybuttons
and for our first experiment we'll use our senses.
Woo woo! A senses experiment! We're ready, Nina!
We know we all have bellybuttons, do you know anyone else who has one?
  My sister.
  My friends at school.
Everyone has a bellybutton. Where is your bellybutton?
  In your tummy.
  Where exactly on your tummy?
  In the middle.
  Right, our bellybutton is in the middle of our tummy,
just like on this dolly.
Let's have a look at some photos of bellybuttons.
Ha ha! How would you describe this bellybutton?
  Got a hole.
  That's right, lots of bellybuttons go in the way,
like this one, and we often call these innies.
But not all bellybuttons do that.
Ha ha, some people have outie bellybuttons, like this one,
that stick out a little bit. Do any of you guys have an outie?
  Yes.
  I do!
You both have outies?
Nobody knows for sure why some people have innies and some outies.
I myself have an innie, but it doesn't matter what kind you have.
OK, let's have a look at one more bellybutton.
Ha ha ha!
'Whoa! That's a strange looking bellybutton!'
Whose bellybutton do you think it might be?
A monkey's.
Good guess. Let's see, shall we?
Oh!
  It's a puppy!
  Yes!
Humans aren't the only ones with bellybuttons,
animals have them, too, like dogs and cats.
You usually can't see them, they're covered in fur.
So we now know that everyone has a bellybutton
in the middle of their tummies and so do lots of animals.
Some people have an innie and some people have an outie
but it doesn't matter what type we have.
We still don't know what why.
To find out more we need to go and see a very special machine,
  so let's go, experimenters!
  Yeah!
Off we go for another adventure.
Nina said, we are going to see a special kind of machine.
Maybe it's a noisy, spinning washing machine.
I hope it's a sandwich making machine.
We'll soon find out, Neurons, we're here!
  Are you excited about it?
  Yes.
Hi, Lucy. Hi, Yvonne.
  Hi, Nina.
  We've come to a clinic which helps mummies having babies.
and as you can see from Yvonne's big tummy, she's having a baby.
This is Lucy, she's a midwife who works here.
You have a special machine
that lets you see the baby inside a mummy's tummy?
It's an ultrasound machine. Will we look at Yvonne's baby?
Yes, please.
Mmm, that doesn't smell like the nice jelly you have with ice cream.
That's right, Ollie, you can't eat this jelly.
The place where a baby grows inside a mummy is called the womb.
The womb is a special space in a mummy's tummy
full of a liquid that's a bit like water.
The ultrasound machine lets us see the baby
by creating a picture on that screen.
I can see the baby, but it looks so small.
It is small, Luke. Babies start off being teeny tiny,
but they grow bigger in their mummy's womb.
Babies can grow there because of something called an umbilical cord.
The umbili...what, Nina?
The umbilical cord, Bud.
Here is a drawing of a baby inside its mummy's womb.
Can you see this long thin thing that looks like a piece of string
  joining the baby to its mummy?
  Yes.
That's the umbilical cord. Now, where does the cord join the baby?
  On its belly.
  Yes, right where our bellybuttons are.
Once the baby's born,
it doesn't need an umbilical cord any more, so a doctor cuts it off.
Ooh! Does that hurt, Nina?
No, it doesn't hurt at all, Felix, it's like having your hair cut.
After the cord's gone, all that is left is a little bump,
which is the baby's bellybutton.
Can anyone see the baby's umbilical cord?
I can. I can see it.
Can you? Well spotted! Ha ha!
  Would you like to hear the baby's heart beating?
  Yes, please.
That sounds amazing, Nina.
Isn't it, Belle? Thank you for showing us the ultrasound machine.
You're welcome.
  Thank you for letting us look at your baby.
  My pleasure, Nina.
We discovered that our bellybutton is left over from the umbilical cord
we all had when we were in our mummy's womb.
What does an umbilical cord do?
I've got an experiment that will show us the answer.
  Let's head back to the lab! Thanks again, bye.
  Bye!
OK, we're going to pretend that this is a mummy's womb inside her tummy.
I need someone to go inside and pretend to be a baby.
Izzy, hand up first! On you go.
This is great, I love pretending.
We're going to pretend this tube is an umbilical cord.
An umbilical cord's a bit like a drinking straw.
Things can travel inside it, like drinking liquid through a straw.
We're also going to pretend these balls are important things
a baby needs to help it grow.
  Tell me, what do you think those things might be?
  Food.
Food will help the baby grow big and strong.
That's right, Bud, these balls are our pretend food,
the baby needs two other things to help it grow.
  Water?
  That's right, pretend water and these are pretend air.
Air is the invisible gas all around us that we breathe in
and I need you guys to roll these balls along the umbilical cord
into the pretend womb.
OK, get rolling!
You can catch them at the end, Izzy. Oh, well done.
Ha ha ha.
Very good. When the baby's in its mummy's tummy,
it can't eat, drink or breathe on its own like we can,
so its mummy gives the baby food, water and air
through the umbilical cord, which helps the baby to grow.
There are some yellow balls that are already inside our pretend womb,
so, Izzy, can I get you to put the yellow balls into the tube
and pass them back through to us?
Push it, push it! Oh, here it comes!
  You got it?
  I have.
The baby can't go to the bathroom and use the toilet like we can,
these yellow balls are the waste the baby needs its mummy to get rid of.
The umbilical cord helps a baby to grow in its mummy's womb.
The cord brings the baby food, water and air
and it takes away the waste, like poo and wee!
  Yuck!
  Ha ha ha!
Nina and the Neurons!
Your question   what are bellybuttons for?
I think we've answered it.
Everyone has a bellybutton in the middle of their tummy,
we were lucky enough to see a baby growing inside its mummy's tummy
in a space called the womb.
The baby was joined to her by the umbilical cord.
We found out the mummy's body uses the umbilical chord
to give the baby the food, water and air it needs
and take away waste.
When the baby's born, it doesn't need the umbilical cord any more,
so the doctors cut the cord off
and the little bumpy bit of skin that's left over
is what we call our bellybutton.
  I hope that's answered your question.
  Thanks, Nina, bye!
