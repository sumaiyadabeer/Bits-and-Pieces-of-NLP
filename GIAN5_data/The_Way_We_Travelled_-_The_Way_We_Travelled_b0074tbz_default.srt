I'm just a lucky bastard, basically.
I'm an ordinary explorer in an extraordinary world.
My God.
Rough Guide radically changed the way people travelled.
In a city obsessed with beauty, even the firefighters are hunky.
No matter how much you say it was stylish tossers swanning around the world, you can't make it stick.
We're riding shotgun with patrol car Golf Zulu 4.
I was bungling around the world.
It's not reality TV. It really is reality.
There's no acting. Whatever happens, happens.
We used to think an exotic holiday meant cocktails on the Costas,
but now we all want a walk on the wild side,
shoulder our backpacks, travel further than ever before, all without a tour guide.
This new spirit of adventure began with programmes like Rough Guide,
that cut through tourist brochure claptrap to tell it like it is.
Explorers like Benedict Allen showed for the first time
what it was like to travel alone in Earth's most remote places.
But what really got us interested,
was when an old face in a new role took on an amazing challenge.
PHONE RINGS Hello?
Yup. ..BBC, yes, I know.
Mmm. You want me to what? Go round the world?
They came to me secretively, saying,
"This is something only you can do. You're ideal for this programme.
"Without you, it won't work. With you, it could be wonderful."
I agreed   not just cos of the flattery,
but the idea of going around the world, I thought, "Yes! At last, I get to see the world."
About halfway round, we were stuck in some freighter outside Madras
and the director revealed that I wasn't the first person they asked.
I was actually the fourth person,
after Alan Whicker, Miles Kington and Noel Edmonds.
But you can go round the world in 36 hours...
Ah! 80...
80 days... Yes.
Oh, I see. And I'd be... I'd be Phileas Fogg.
And we follow Jules Verne and no aircraft.
So in 1988, actor, writer and all round good bloke Michael Palin,
took on the challenge in Around The World In 80 Days.
It was a chance for a breather in my...whatever one calls it,
barely a career, just my activities.
And this offer came just at the right time.
Goodbye, everybody!
Bye, Mikey!
Why do you all look so happy?
'Well, that's it. I've said goodbye.
'Like it or not, I'm off, round the world.'
Michael Palin was born in Yorkshire in 1943. His dad was an export manager at the local steelworks.
I grew up in Sheffield after the war,
and there was very little opportunity to travel.
There were no cheap travel tickets. Plane flights were for the rich.
So I was stuck in Sheffield, reading about people exploring the world
and reading Biggles In The Gobi and National Geographic Magazine
'and thinking myself, imagining myself in these countries.'
That'll be good to check on my progress.
In the '60s, at Oxford University, he began writing comedy.
  And now...
  It's...
But it wasn't until 1970 that Palin and pals became household names
in the classic Monty Python's Flying Circus.
The surreal series earned them all cult status and international fame.
Michael Palin is a very funny, very clever man and a great writer
and I'm always glad to see him.
I cut down trees I skip and jump
I like to press wild flowers
I put on women's clothing And hang around in bars!
He's also written and starred in numerous TV programmes and films.
He puts on women's clothing... And hangs around in bars?
Remember that this is his SECOND incredibly successful career,
being, effectively, a TV travel journalist.
I think he does terribly well. I have mixed feelings about it
because I was offered Around The World In 80 Days and turned it down
and they went to Michael Palin and he went on to become enormously successful and rich and famous
because he did it very well.
It was terrifying because there was no model on which to base it.
There'd been nothing like that. The idea was I'd talk to the camera, which would be there at all times  
in my cabin, when I'm walking, when I'm buying a ticket and I don't know the language and all that.
I was just bungling my way around the world, the way you do.
Cairo?
But...gradually I realised that
the idea of buying a ticket at a Cairo train station may look chaotic,
but that's the way it would be for most people.
Most travellers would still have to get into a situation like that.
Cairo? ..Cairo?
..OK. Here we go.
'Perhaps it's better to show that than to have it all done for you
'so you're just, plonk, at a great landmark, plonk, in a wonderful landscape.'
  How many, sir?
  One.
  One?
  Yes, one way to Cairo.
  One?
  Yes, one. Just me, one way.
  Cairo?
  Yes.
  Today?
  Yes.
'How you get there and what you do when you get there and where you stay after you've been there
'are all important and no one had done that before.'
I have to go there? I've just come from there!
I shall WALK to Cairo at this rate.
It's like Mark Twain's Innocents Abroad.
Put someone down who knows nothing, and you discover it all with him.
With Around The World In 80 Days, he had a very distinct challenge,
something the viewer could follow and you could see where he'd got to
and you could see it when the boat wasn't going to leave for another three days because of some quirk
and he was amazing. No one else could have done that the way he did.
Ah.
Well, now we've got real problems. The Algeria is not running.
Engine trouble. It's been cancelled.
Um...
The next boat...that I can GET
is the Saudi Queen. That's tomorrow.
That won't get me into Jedda in time for the connection, so we are...
well...well and truly scuppered.
The third programme has a sequence where I'm saying how rotten I feel
and I want to sit down and there's no chairs and I'm stuck on a dhow.
"I just want to go home!" Pathetic, really,
but for a lot of people, that was their favourite episode.
Realities aren't always quite as nice as the romance.
Dhow travel can be tough. Oh, dear.
Just the thought of a chapatti today makes me...
Makes me want to go home! 'The fact that I got ill...'
"Ooh, you were ill in that one!"
It was only a short sequence, but most presenters don't tell the camera how bad they're feeling!
Whilst Michael Palin was changing the face of travel reporting,
it was business as usual in the comfy, cosy world
of mainstream holiday shows.
Some people like to get away from it all,
but most like to find it all there waiting.
Hello, and this week we find it's still all there on the Costa Brava.
This safe and sunny fare was about to be turned on its head
by two in your face presenters  
Sankha Guha and Magenta Devine.
Known in TV as a PISS to camera.
A girl's hair, heels and profile can never be too high. Actually, that goes for the boys, too.
In Zimbabwe, as in much of Africa, the AIDS pandemic is here and now.
Rough Guide saw itself as an antidote to traditional holiday programmes.
When the Rough Guides came along, it was like this magic door had opened
and you found out that you could go to Paris on a budget,
you could travel and not break the bank
and you had Magenta Devine telling you this
in these great shades, looking uber cool.
I used to fancy Magenta Devine like mad.
I used to watch it just for her.
I didn't ever think I'd go on any of these...
"Here I am in Rio de Janeiro and I'm going to the trendiest club."
This isn't some weird, masochistic sightseeing trip. I'm waiting to go up to Rio's hippest club.
That was a different form of travel fantasy  
one than involved me in bed with Magenta Devine in Rio de Janeiro.
Real name Kim Taylor, Magenta got her first break in TV on Channel 4,
presenting Janet Street Porter's new youth programme, Network 7, with sidekick Sankha Guha.
When Janet joined the Beeb, she took them with her.
I chose Magenta because once you'd seen her, you'd never forget her.
God knows, she looked like a stick wearing dark glasses.
Sunglasses, even when it was raining.
That's what I remember about her.
Magenta always wears sunglasses because Magenta is dead lazy
and Magenta's always late and can't be bothered to do her eye makeup.
There goes my love rocket red...
Magenta had previously worked as a record company PR agent
for, amongst others, '80s one hit wonders Sigue Sigue Sputnik.
Shoot it up...
She wore some ridiculous outfits.
We were in Africa and she wore a rubber miniskirt and high heels
and wondered why everyone was looking!
I do not possess a rubber miniskirt so I can't have worn it anywhere.
And there was another one in Spain where she came to film in a church
in a bra top and couldn't see what the problem was.
I'm not saying I didn't wear stuff that was a bit skimpy sometimes,
but I did check with our local fixers,
"If I wear this, will I offend everyone?"
Journalist Sankha Guha also got his first break in TV on Network 7.
You can beat the exam system in legitimate ways, but why bother when there's a much easier way   cheat.
Sankha I chose as an antidote to Magenta because he was cooler
and he seemed more composed. They were a good foil for each other.
Fast cut and using wacky camera angles, the first programme was Rough Guide To Amsterdam.
  Amsterdam has a reputation.
  Fun City Europe.
  In the '60s, it was a magnet
  for acid heads,
  hippies
  and hobbits.
It distanced itself from other holiday programmes
with stories about drugs, squatters prostitution and doggie doo doo.
I saw Rough Guide as a rolling current affairs programme  
part travel and tips on how to get there and what to do there,
but also it was about stories,
history, political context, social affairs.
The stories that concerned people who lived there.
You want to know where the locals go for lunch,
where THEY go that's not a rip off, what clubs people your age go to.
For creatures of the night, Paris is a good place to avoid sunshine.
But be warned   you'd better not be a POOR creature of the night.
You want to know how to walk round a town
in the way that locals do and that was the ethos behind Rough Guide.
In Madrid, I do as the Madrilenos do,
which means I've spent the day hopping from one bar to another.
Young people travelling on their own want to know about the bars, the clubs, "the scene" wherever that is.
Mmm, that's absolutely beautiful. Perhaps we could stop filming now and I'll just finish off this one.
You wouldn't know about them if you'd watched the traditional shows.
With shows like Rough Guide, the world suddenly woke up and thought,
"Ooh, there are different ways to travel. There are things to see past the beach and the bullfight."
I think the way that that suddenly started to mingle straightforward travel with an edge,
with digging into a community,
with finding some alternatives for tourists   it must be a good thing.
Part of the fun of making it was that we made it up as we went along.
It was fly by the seat of your pants television.
We were in Lubliana, of all places, and we found this performance artist called Marco Movitch
and he put on this performance which involved setting a river alight,
throwing petrol all over it and then cavorting around in the river with this flame thrower
going under the water with his flame thrower valiantly poking out.
What Marco didn't tell us was that firstly he had no licence,
or indeed very much experience or any kind of safety concerns.
  Has anyone ever suggested that you should see a psychiatrist?
  Never.
The river goes up in flames
and he's getting carried away by the fact that he's being filmed
and he's telling his colleague to throw more and more petrol in
and we watch as the flames start licking up the river to where his colleague is pouring the petrol in!
At which point, I think we realised that it was pretty well improvised.
The Wednesday edition of Rough Guide carried a little disclaimer saying,
"Don't try this at home. Marco is a fully trained performance artist."
With Rough Guide, there was a so called "update" on the Sunday when it was repeated
and generally there wasn't much to update between Wednesday and Sunday.
This time, the update was that Marco had incinerated himself
repeating this performance for someone else.
Rough Guide might have fancied itself as being more adventurous
than other travel shows, but it was about to be shown a thing or two
by a young explorer going where no TV traveller had gone before.
I was known as an adventure, all round hero. ..No, I'm joking.
But a sort of explorer character.
And the BBC said, "Why don't you take a video camera around with you?"
The first thing Benedict filmed was his journey in the Amazon jungle  
his quest to find a lost lake and its legendary giant snake.
I like to think it was a bit of TV history in a sense.
It was the first time someone had shown a real expedition,
the ups and downs of being alone and facing dangers or imagined dangers
with the leeches, the jaguars and the drug barons   the local baddies.
My God!
OK, it's a tiger, but it's a small one.
And it's about ten feet away.
(It's uncertain.)
It's travel as adventure,
and he was able to do that because he had a small, mobile camera,
didn't need a big entourage, could film the experience in the raw.
That was small, but it could have killed me and, um...
if I'd been facing the other way, it WOULD have killed me.
It would have taken one leap at my neck...
and that would have been that.
My dad was a pilot. He used to fly backwards and forwards from Africa
and he used to bring back amazing things like an African dance mask
and a little stuffed crocodile and a little snake in a bottle of meths.
I used to put all these things in my bedroom
and I thought, "When I grow up, I want to see these exotic places."
So I hung on through all these family holidays,
enjoying them, but wanting to go far further
to the Amazon and Borneo and the Congo, all these wonderful names.
And, finally, I did. Off I went.
Benedict's expeditions began when he was 23 and still living at home.
He paid for them by stacking shelves at the local supermarket.
My manager's going for the Indiana Jones look,
but this is how people want to see me   Indiana Jones.
You wouldn't believe it to look at me, but I'm addicted to danger.
I can't resist the sense of privilege and the magic of going to places no one's ever been
and I'll do anything to try and understand
the world of the remote tribes I live with.
In Papua New Guinea, I was cut with bamboo during a six week initiation.
We lost two pints of blood each
and I thought, "This is really bad. It can't get any worse."
But that was just the first day.
By the end of it, the tribal elders had him running around starkers
save for a grass skirt and... they painted him green.
For me, the local people are the key to that environment.
What I try to do is understand from so called tribal people their world
and so whether they belong to a crocodile cult, as in New Guinea, or another group called the Matses
who put bamboo spikes in their lips.
The Matses are known as the Jaguar People.
Before a hunt, they believe that putting plant spines through their noses and painting their faces
will give them the strength and agility of the top Amazon predator.
I want to understand their world,
or just get a glimpse of their understanding of this environment
and start to see it, not as a threat or as a jungle, but as a home
and that is what it's all about   getting that place on your side.
It may be dangerous at first, but hopefully you learn to handle it.
Perfecto!
But learning about the culture and environment doesn't mean there won't be the odd misunderstanding.
Sign language is crucial to me and I was walking along in the Amazon
with my pet monkey, a spider monkey called Mono.
He was delightful   a little dark haired creature.
He'd sit on my shoulder and I never understood him, but he'd chatter all day. We got on really well.
We came to a village. I said to some local people who looked friendly,
"Is it possible...?" Like a tourist, shouting cos the locals don't understand you
"Is it possible to get something to EAT...EAT
for ME...and my monkey, Mono?"
So I was gesturing away. "Eat..."
They looked enthusiastic. I thought, "Brilliant. They're friendly."
They sat me down and Mono scampered away and I started talking to them.
Finally, they brought out this wooden platter with this meat on.
I thought, "Wow! Something lovely for Mono and me!"
I looked down and, of course, it WAS Mono
and it was terrible, really, seeing his little face staring up and I really thought, "I can't eat him."
Then I thought, "Oh, well, maybe..." I'm afraid I did have a little...
a little sample. He was delicious, actually.
After three months in the jungle,
Benedict finally found the Amazon's lost lake.
He didn't find the legendary monster snake,
but he celebrated anyway.
This is my little treat, here.
I've been saving this packet of biscuits up for weeks
and it's very naughty...
..because I haven't shared this out with anyone else, but I've smuggled this packet all the way out here...
..and I'm going to enjoy it just by myself, thank you very much.
Mmm mmm mmm mmmmmm!
Mmm mmm mmmmmmm!
Mmm.
Bliss! Ah! Mmm! Mmm!
Back in civilisation, it was an anxious time for Michael Palin
as he neared the end of his goal to circle the world in 80 days.
  New York, please.
  New York?
  Sleeper.
  New York'll be two from the rear end of the train, sir.
  OK. Fine.
'Attention, please. Would Michael Palin come to the ticket office, please? Michael Palin.'
With minutes left to make a train, things started to go off the rails.
Someone paged me. There's a message for Mr Palin?
  That's me.
  Great.
  Call this gentleman right here.
It wasn't even urgent. It was a mate in Chicago asking him to call.
'A friendship has come within a whisker of wrecking my chances.'
I'm not going round the world again.
'In the end, we were very lucky to squeeze home.'
At various points, there was a real fear that we might not do it.
We began to plan the last piece to camera.
"I missed it by two days. It's more difficult than you think." It sounded so lame.
So thank God we made it on time.
Thank God the Reform Club refused to let us in and film because they had a function on that afternoon.
That made such a wonderful ending.
Well, this is the Reform Club
where Phileas Fogg started his journey and where I began MY journey
on September the 25th 1988, 79 days and seven hours ago.
Sadly, for reasons of their own, the club do not want me to film in there
so, I have to say, this is the end of the journey, on the pavement, outside 104 Pall Mall. That's it.
All our series end in some wonderful anticlimax
which is so much better than raising the flag and saying, "We've done it! Heroes!" We weren't. We were lucky.
Despite him crossing every continent,
his teenage kids were unimpressed with their old man's antics.
To expect your children to say,
"Father, tell us your stories of what you've seen in the wide world," is just purely romantic illusion.
They're off watching Top Of The Pops which means far more to them
than Dad burbling on about the port where he missed a freighter. They know they'll see it on TV anyway.
After the success of 80 Days,
Michael was besieged by producers with atlases under their arms,
asking him to choose his next location.
Having been around the world, he decided to go down the world, from pole to pole.
It proved to be a dangerous choice.
One of the moments when I really felt I shouldn't have done this
was when we were actually...
trying to get to the North Pole on Pole To Pole
and we had this small plane, just two propeller plane,
took us out from Northern Canada
and then flew to the point where the North Pole was below us.
Because the North Pole is on open ocean, we had to land on ice floes.
Because we'd arrived in May, slightly late in the year,
the ice sheet had begun to break up so it was like a fractured eggshell.
He had to get the biggest of these ice floes and land on it
and he was saying, "This is quite dangerous cos the sun isn't out."
I thought, "The sun isn't out? Let's just land!"
I thought he was going for luxury, but it was a quite practical point.
Without the sun, he couldn't see the ridges on the ice, their shadows.
He said one of those ridges could flip the plane over. He's shouting, "Blah, blah, flip the plane over!"
I'm saying, "Forget it. Let's start somewhere else that begins with P.
"Peterborough To The Pole. Anywhere, just don't put us through this."
Twice we tried to land, and twice we aborted landing on the tiny ice floe
and I remember thinking, my heart thudding, "I don't need to do this."
How would I explain it to my family
or the family of the camera crew and everybody,
if this went wrong, as it seemed about to do.
But the third time, we got down and could do our piece to camera and fly off again.
I'm going to make a journey
from here to the South Pole which is...well, in every direction.
THAT way goes down through Japan.
THAT way goes down through India.
But we've chosen a route THAT way, 30 degrees east line of longitude, down through Russia and Africa.
It's going to be a hell of a long journey, but...well, let's go!
I get recognised by British people
or people who've seen the series, Australians or Canadians mainly,
but I prefer to go to places where I'm not known at all
because, for me, the pleasure is in observing the world, rather than being observed myself.
If someone's pointing and saying, "Ooh, I've just seen your film,"
it's impossible for me to watch them and see how they live
and that's really what it's about.
We had a classic case in the very northern part of Norway
on a ferry which wound through the islands.
We were almost at the tip of Norway and we thought we'd interview a few people
The cloud was coming down. It looked really grim. Who would live there?
We found a lighthouse keeper looking morosely out, so I talked to him.
I said that it must be very lonely. "Yah, it is. It's very lonely."
But six months of the year it's dark, isn't it?
"Yah, it's very dark six months of the year."
So what do you do? And he said, "We watch your programmes on the television!"
The interview was rather redundant!
  So 28 days, no drink?
  Yah.
  Is that hard?
  Cut it.
"We love that bit that you did with the dancing girls
"and the parrot that pecked your leg in Hong Kong." Yes, please, OK.
  What music do you like?
  Larry Finnegan.
  We'll play it. What?
  Larry Finnegan, I like. Country music.
Larry Finnegan? We'll play a bit of that over this interview so you won't be heard at all.
Good mornin', pillow
What kind of night has it been?
He has totally cornered the market in "nice, relatively ordinary man
goes to fascinating places and has a laugh with the people"
which, for me, is the essence of travel, and he does it brilliantly.
But whilst Michael Palin was establishing himself as one of the nicest blokes on TV,
the Rough Guiders were establishing themselves as the rudest.
The Little Mermaid is the symbol of Copenhagen
and she must have been caressed by more tourists than a Dutch hooker.
These people who have travelled to see her must feel a bit miserable
because this is one of the most disappointing sites in the world.
After the first series' success, Rough Guide was pulling in three million viewers.
But not everyone was enjoying the show.
By the end of the second series, we were banned from three continents.
The Indian, Turkish and Brazilian governments said, "Don't come back."
We took it as a vote of confidence.
People never made the connection,
"If they cover guns and street kids and crime in THIS country...
"Oh, they might do that in OUR country as well."
No, they thought we'd arrive and only show the positive side.
Rio, certainly, was just a fabulous place.
We went to do a story in the slums there, the favelas,
and in sunlight they actually look quite cute, from a distance.
When you go in, it's different.
But thank God, on the day we went to film it was pouring with rain.
It's ironic that part of the charm of this city comes from the slums squashed against the mountainsides.
But that charm is soon dispelled once you're IN a favela like this.
I was drenched from head to foot,
walking in this mud, everything sliding about
and it sounds so callous to say, "It was really perfect!"
But it was, because you saw what it was   a disgusting awful place that no one should have to live in.
We weren't saying, "Do something stupid and come out here
"with your cameras and your shorts and swan around having a holiday."
It was really saying, "Fine, you go to Copacabana or Ipanema and you see the city of the picture postcards,
"but be aware that there is this other city which is part of Rio."
It enriches anyone's experience of travel
when they know that all of that is there and this is what informs the culture and the life of that place.
While Rough Guide's approach led to bans in Brazil and India,
their piece in Kenya nearly put a stop to someone else's programme.
They filmed a mock lynching, which is what they do in Nairobi.
If someone robs you and you say, "Thief!" everyone grabs them and beats them up or burns them
and they'd re enacted this, which didn't go down well.
If you're caught thieving on the street, you could be arrested,
tried and sentenced to death, all in about ten seconds
and it only takes two little words.
Stop thief!
As a result, my TV programme was postponed and everything
and eventually, we had to plead and grovel,
and we were allowed to do it, as long as we did no re enactments of muggings.
But mixing items about world poverty with fashion and music
led to criticism that Rough Guide put style over content.
  Is this the Third World or is this Manhattan?
  Bombay.
Sure, it was stylish and packaged in a way that made it attractive and interesting to our target audience,
but we never compromised on the journalism.
No matter how much you say it was just stylish tossers swanning about,
you couldn't make it stick simply because of our agenda  
the people we talked to, the stories we told and the depth we went into.
Sankha Guha left Rough Guide after four series
and was replaced by journalist Rajan Datar.
Florida has one big housing problem,
with 35 million tourists a year, a thousand new residents a day
and the hapless victims of Florida's most unwelcome guest, the hurricane.
Rajan was then replaced by former Brookside actor, Simon O'Brien.
Those people who do travel further afield discover a country which,
due to its variety of people and wildlife, is dubbed Africa's Africa.
But by the mid '90s, Rough Guide had run out of steam.
We were filming at Niagara Falls and this guy came up, very excited.
"Where are you doing on the new series?"
And this was when we did go mainstream,
this one series where we did Majorca, Ibiza
and when I told him I could see his face just fall and he went,
"You're doing Majorca? Oh, no! Portugal? Oh, no!
"I don't want to see that. I want to see you in interesting places."
That's what people wanted from Rough Guide.
Rough Guide was finally laid to rest after eight years on air.
It helped open up the world and now there were few new places left.
To see those, we'd need a real explorer.
Enter Benedict Allen, with another mad idea.
I'd learnt a freedom in the rainforest,
where you always feel the odd one out
and I felt I'd achieved something there by finding my place there,
but I didn't understand these other environments and I thought if I could just link up with a camel  
camels know that place, they're adapted   then I'd achieve freedom.
So I decided to walk along the Skeleton Coast in south west Africa
with three camels. I managed to train the camels, including Nelson.
Ready, Nelson?
Nelson did not want to go on this journey. He was a top camel.
He was a little old before his time.
It was a battle to get him to go,
but finally Nelson agreed to come along
as long as I took his two best friends,
Andreas and Jan, these other two camels who hero worshipped him.
So Nelson and his two friends set off with me
It was wonderful when I got Nelson on my side.
I discovered he didn't like sand dunes.
Nelson is moaning and groaning cos one of his pet hates is sand dunes,
which he's in the middle of, and the other is the sea,
and we've at last broken through to the sea and you can see the Skeleton Coast.
Can you imagine choosing a camel that was allergic to sand dunes?
Has this phobia about slopes...
System is push and pull
Everything is a push and pull...
Then I discovered he'd never got to know women. He was scared of women.
We came across some tribal people called the Himba who are great
and they wanted to meet my camels, never seen them before,
but Nelson hated women.
He does absurd things, like fixing solar panels to the sides of camels
so that he can be self sufficient.
Come on. Calm down.
If you want to really hurt yourself, there's nothing to beat Benedict Allen and his camels in Namibia.
He goes out on much more of a limb than I do.
Look at that beautiful sunset, Nelson.
Will you marry me?
..Maybe taking things a little bit too far.
There was this wonderful moment in the Namib Desert when we came across elephants and...
It was just me, my camels  
including Nelson the top camel   and these elephants. It was like a little bit of Eden,
deep in this desert. I'll always remember that peace I had with animals of such grandeur and power.
It was such a privilege to be alone with these powerful animals  
no Land Rovers, no safari groups, no safari guides in safari jackets.
Just me, my camera and the elephants.
'If you call yourself an explorer nowadays,'
you've got to be doing something a bit different, something special.
So, for me, it's all about leaving MY world behind.
That's what I try and do. I leave the mobile phone, don't have a GPS if I can help it,
don't have one of these satellite systems or radio transmitter.
I leave that all behind. That means being very vulnerable. I have to survive off my wits.
This policy dumped him right in it on his next expedition   a 1,000 mile journey by dogsled
across Siberia.
I've spent 20 years crossing the world's most severe deserts and jungles...
..but I've never tackled the extreme cold.
Now my aim was to survive in the Arctic with dogs,
cross the Baring Strait and to film it all myself.
We are on our way, after a fashion.
Not as many of us as I'd like to have. Got nine dogs...
and the tenth member of the team refused to be harnessed
and he's just running along, free.
So he's not contributing anything, which I think is very selfish.
The thing I'd REALLY like to have, um, a go about at Benedict is that,
well, his latest series, the Siberia series,
and he's saying, "It's a bit cold." You think, "Of course it's cold!"
I had to tackle a problem that had been worrying me all day.
How to have a pee at minus 30 AND in these furs.
They were lovely and warm, but reindeer skins don't come with a fly.
That's the way. You just go...
I think it's a very brave thing that he does  
filming himself doing a journey. I can't think of anything worse.
I try and...break through the whole convention of the film crew.
On a serious expedition, you can't have a crew. They'd die off one by one.
Some days, it's hard enough to put one foot in front of another, let alone turn on a camera,
and THOSE are the bits that make a film interesting.
I've got a problem.
And it's a serious one.
I went ahead to try and find a way through the ice blocks,
left the dogs, left the sledge...
and I can't find my way back.
I was 160km from the nearest human.
Without the dogs and sledge, it may as well have been 1,000.
It would take me ten days to walk home.
My emergency supplies would last me only four.
No one knew where I was.
Keeping filming was a way of keeping calm.
'I just try and film myself, film everyday ups and downs
'and make the most of whatever happens. It's not that easy'
and you don't get those glorious sweeping shots...
the beautiful texture that a film crew can get, the lovely sound they can get with boom microphones.
It's just me scrambling through the desert, the Arctic, all alone. But whatever you do get is reality.
There's a chance that they've... left...
made a run for it. That may be why I can't find them, but...
I like to think they've...stayed and they're waiting for me.
Oh, no. OK, this is not the beginning of a nightmare.
No, no. I need this stove.
It's not reality TV, it really is reality. There's no acting.
Whatever happens, happens. That's the glory of it.
Benedict eventually found his dogs and made it back...
..to the amazement of the locals.
So far, the welcome has been subdued...
Yes, Yasha, I'm still alive.
For Michael Palin's next challenge, he decided to fulfil a boyhood dream
and take a 10,000 mile trip across the Sahara.
It was a world that was just so utterly different from my own that I didn't quite believe in it.
It was a different kind of perception than somewhere like the frozen north.
I could see the frozen north because sometimes parts of Yorkshire would get frozen
and look like pictures of the Alps.
But the desert, no, I knew nothing like that, where nothing grew, just sand blew all day long.
So I think there was a fascination from very early on with the mystery of the desert
and I wanted to find out what really went on in the heart of the desert
and was it really the way you'd imagined it?
And it seemed rather a seductive place, too   smooth, comfortable, sun always shining,
somewhere that involved your emotions and your soul as well as just your physical sense.
Less than 100 miles from the Libyan border,
we're in this arid, almost lunar, landscape of southern Tunisia.
It's so arid and uncongenial here that for the last 700 years,
people have been living in caves under the ground.
Believe it or not, I DO know this place.
I was crucified here 23 years ago for The Life Of Brian.
Always look on the bright side of life...
I've always wanted to come back because it is so unforgettable.
The place remains in your mind. Not many people have gone back to the place they were crucified.
Always look on the bright side of life...
And it wasn't the only Pythonesque thing to happen on his travels.
A sense of humour and a sense of appreciation of the absurd
is absolutely vital. It just does happen.
'We interviewed a man in Dakar, a wonderful nightclub owner,
'in this music club...and... he'd had a few beers, I must say.'
Ah, the manager.
'I was asking him about the club and he said,'
"I've managed many clubs in my life. But this club very, very different."
I was quite intrigued. "Why is this club different?"
He said, "The others were all..." and he looked at me for a bit,
"..rectangular." And I thought that was brilliant. That's a Python line.
The other clubs were rectangular. I was waiting for something else. "All rectangular."
Over 30 million viewers tuned in to Michael Palin's Sahara series,
establishing him as Britain's favourite travel presenter.
He's become so popular that his influence is known in the travel trade as the Palin Effect.
I think programmes where people like Michael Palin recently crossed through the Sahara Desert
are fantastic.
Although it's very hard to buy a holiday in the Sahara Desert
and to visit almost any of those places he went to, it excites people
and makes them think, "I want to get away and do something different.
"I don't just want to sit on the beach. I want to go and explore."
Holidays that are adventurous are increasing as a result of programmes like that.
I've got a fantasy about Michael Palin.
I'm convinced that if we met and got on, he'd take me with him on his travels.
The big problem, of course, with going on holiday with Michael Palin is that it'd take half a year.
Try and ask for six months off work! It's one of the downsides.
The lure of the Sahara was too much for presenter Kate Humble,
who threw caution to the wind and spent five months travelling across the desert by camel.
It was the most extraordinary experience I think I'll ever have of just being able to experience
part of the world which looks like it's had no human...
of course it has, but it looks like it's had no human intervention because the tracks get covered up.
You feel very small and very insignificant. It's just the most incredible landscape.
And to be with people who have been doing this for thousands of years, probably 2,000 years,
and they live very successfully. They're not poor, they're not, um, begging.
They don't want computers and TVs and cars and things. They do their job.
It was a big eye opener in every way.
What was once impossibly exotic, things you just didn't understand, they're now part of everyday life.
People have a lot more access to information. There are lots of cheap flights.
With the internet, anyone can organise themselves a holiday almost anywhere.
For TV gardener Chris Collins, watching travel shows wasn't enough.
Over the past decade, he's been all over the world
and has even followed in Benedict Allen's footsteps with a trip to the rainforest.
The forest at night becomes deafening. At dusk, you get an orange glow over it
and the birds all start. You get this crescendo.
It starts slowly and it builds, bird life all moving around.
As soon as it gets dark, frogs start going...and I don't know what, but it IS deafening. It's SO loud.
Eventually, I fell asleep but, because you sleep so light,
I come out the sleep and, as I did, the air is full of fireflies.
They produce this sort of Day Glo orange glow and they synchronise
so they come off and on. So you... It's quite unbelievable. That, to me, is the essence of travel.
Cos when I'm dying, when I am dying, that is what I'm gonna remember  
not the burger I ate when I was on the drink in Ibiza, or conversations,
or looking at someone on a beach. I will remember those fireflies.
You can go anywhere you want now.
You don't have to be a millionaire to travel round the world.
£700 and you can travel halfway round the world with about ten stops. That's fantastic!
Gap years are a feature for everyone. Everyone's doing it.
You don't retire, you have a gap life. You take off.
This isn't just a young person's thing. People want to do more, they want to scrape below the surface.
They don't just want to do the resort that could be anywhere.
They want to see more, and that's really being catered for nowadays.
It's amazing the people you see trekking round Chile these days.
Um, you know, they're kind of my mum and dad.
There was a very uncomfortable bus ride in Peru.
We were bouncing along and two people I thought were Peruvians turned round and said,
"We're 'ere because of YOU, you know!" And the bus was bouncing.
It was a most uncomfortable ride. But I think some people see these places and say,
"Well, if he can go there, let's have a go ourselves."
It's 15 years since Michael Palin set off on his first programme Around The World In 80 Days.
Since then, he's been to more than 60 different countries.
It is the end of the world.
He's done everything from cooking local food, appearing in foreign films...
..and even judging the odd beauty contest.
If your husband told you he was going away for a year
to film a documentary series in many faraway countries, would you try and stop him?
Trust is the key to a successful relationship, so I will allow my husband to go to other countries.
Besides, it's his job. He's not going there to go girl hunting.
Absolutely right! Certainly not.
Tonight, of course, is an exception.
He's spent more than two years on the road,
so how does his missus cope without him?
She's incredibly tolerant of my travels. Suspiciously tolerant.
Very happy for me to go, but... I think she realises that I enjoy that kind of travel
and that if I just paced around the house all day long, um...
I might be there, at home, but I'd be rather miserable.
No fear of that happening.
His next TV challenge will take him over six months,
covering the length and breadth of the Himalayas.
I just see myself as a lucky, lucky bastard, basically.
I'm just Michael Palin and I've certain talents...
which I think have been exhausted!
We've come a long way since TV travel began.
We've followed a host of screen adventurers to the furthest corners of the globe
and enjoyed every minute.
The appetite for foreign travel is established and it will grow.
Everyone feels the world is theirs for the taking.
If we can all see as many different places and experience as many different places as possible,
that's a good thing for everybody.
Suddenly, the world is out there and it's your chance to see it.
Instead of just watching it, you can go out there yourself.
