Do you dream of being a rock star?
How are chicks gonna dig you if you're, like...?
Have you ever been told you kiss like a washing machine?
There's nothing worse than kissing someone who tastes of a burger.
And are you a complete disaster when it comes to cooking?
This is what kind of a danger I can be in the kitchen. Aargh!
Life is not easy, in fact, sometimes it can be pretty rubbish,
but fear not   we've pout together a bunch of tips and tricks
that will take your life from off key to pitch perfect
in just a few simple steps.
Admit it   we've all done a bit of air guitar in our time,
standing in front of the bedroom mirror
pretending you're on stage at Wembley Stadium
in front of thousands of screaming fans.
Nah, me neither.
Now, one bunch who want to turn their daydreams into reality
are a new band called The Acrylics.
We hooked them up with some music experts
to put them on the road to almost stardom.
Meet The Acrylics from Maidstone in Kent.
They've been together six months, but are on a mission
for global domination.
Tour the world, release album after album...
  Playing stadiums, like...
  Yeah, Wembley, screaming, "Acrylics!".
Come on! I fancy a bit of that.
So they have high hopes for chart success
and sell out arena tours.
Trouble is, they're stuck in their regular venue...
..youngest band member Ben's garden shed.
We've played a couple of friend's parties and stuff.
They're the only ones who've heard us, but they're not dedicated fans.
The band are fed up just jamming to the lawnmower.
It's time to raise their game.
What I think we need to do to become, like, a better band,
  is expand our audience.   And, er, develop a stage presence
  so we can make people come back and see us.
  To make it a show.
  Make it OUR show!
They know where they wanna end up, they just don't have an image
or the expertise to get themselves noticed.
We're not entirely sure how to promote a band.
There's still a lot more we could do to get known.
They're not very organised about things like that,
cos they don't talk about what they're gonna wear,
they just, kind of, go on and do what they do, really!
I don't think we're, like, confident enough yet
to just completely go mental on stage.
You're never gonna make it On your own...
If these guys have any chance
of taking their band from shed to stadium,
they need some help, and we've got just the boys.
..What a mistake To talk you down like that
And I'm sorry, so won't you come and fight back...?
Hey, we're Saving Aimee, and we've worked our nuts off
  to get where we are today.
  You said, "Nuts," dude!
Three years ago, Saving Aimee were unknown.
Now they have an album out
and tour with The Ting Tings and McFly.
And we started of playing to literally no one
for about a year. We'd play at their dingy little pub.
Keep on going and slogging away until you break through.
We can teach anyone how to rock! yeah!
So, can Saving Aimee save The Acrylics?
Well, they have no idea who their mentors will be,
and they've got high hopes.
Hopefully someone good!
  The Feeling.
  McFly.
I wouldn't mind Girls Aloud. I'm up for a bit of that!
Yeah, you wish, Dan!
  Hi, guys.
  Saving Aimee have entered the shed.
And after a bit of boy band bonding,
  their mentors need to see what they're up against.
  All right, guys,
show me how you rock, man.
  Is that cool?
  Yeah!
Tempers high
Took her for drinks...
We've never played in front of anyone like that, so it was quite...
quite nervy...nervous... But, er, it wasn't too bad, I think.
Oh, won't you still be mine?
They're playing well, but obviously there's a lot
they can improve on.
To help The Acrylics, there are three crucial areas to work on  
transforming frontman Dan into a rock god,
getting the band promoted,
and giving them the confidence to play to strangers.
Dan's up first.
Hold it like you don't really care it's in your hand.
You've gotta be cool. How are chicks gonna dig you, if you're like...?
  Strut up and down here.
  And untuck your shirt, man.
  Yeah.
  You're not at school.
  What kind of a strut...?   Just be confident.
He started off shy,
but I think me and Tom brought it out of him a little bit.
If you came out and started giving it the fist of power,
I'm gonna want to see you again. Let's see what you've got.
Fist of power! That's what I'm talking about!
Part of The Acrylics' problem is that they're completely unknown,
so Satoshi gets to work on raising their profile.
A main thing when you start a band is online promotion.
Saving Aimee have over 22,000 friends on their MySpace page.
The Acrylics? Well, not so many...
You've got 92 friends. You should be spending half an hour a day
just adding random people. Going on other bands' MySpaces.
Message them and tell them to check you out.
You can get more tips about how to start your own band
on the Almost Perfect pages on the BBC Switch website.
They only have 92 friends. Not good enough.
A promoter'll go on their page and won't take them seriously.
What a mistake to turn you down like that
And I'm sorry So won't you come and fight back?
It was a mistake To turn you down...
The advertising's taking shape, but with so much competition out there,
the boys will need a strong image.
Basically, you guys need to know how to sell your band to a promoter
so he or she knows where to put you on the different bills and nights.
You don't wanna be on the wrong show in front of the wrong people,
cos you'll feel like crap and the promoter just won't book you again.
So what's your demographic, who's gonna come and watch you?
  Anyone who likes to jump about.
  You guys'll be good, man.
So show me some headbanging, man...
Next up, their mentors try to transform The Acrylics
from a slow band to a show band.
  I'm concentrating! I can't!
  That's not the point...
You're on stage, in a band to be a performer.
Entertain. Kids wanna see you go nuts.
After their quick lesson on how to hold a guitar...
Show me the rock.
..the lads really get into the session.
  That's it, man!
  Good work, boys.
  How old are you?
  You're 13? Like, that's mad!
Next, James helps Ben big up his role in the band.
Why not give the crowd something to look at?
Just twiddle your sticks in the air a bit.
Party time, man. You're back here. You have to move.
You've got the easiest job.
You got me where you want me again
And I can't get away
I'm hanging by a thread And I'm feeling like a fool...
Saving Aimee have a tour to get back to,
but they leave The Acrylics with the biggest challenge of their lives.
Tomorrow night, we've set you up a gig down in Hoxton
in a venue that's seen the likes of Kate Nash, the Guillemots...
It's been an amazing makeover for the Maidstone boys,
but now they're on their own.
I think tomorrow night they're not gonna have any sort of problem
with pleasing the crowd or the promoter who's putting them on.
I'm just really excited. It'll be the biggest place that we've played at.
  I'm sure in about five years we'll be...
  We'll be supporting them.
  Crossing paths again.
  Yeah.
We're gonna rock hardcore!
  Good luck, guys.
  Let's not go that way, we'll get run over.
  Yeah.
It's showtime for The Acrylics.
Just 24 hours ago, they had only ever played
in front of their friends and family,
  or in their shed.
  Saving Aimee's confidence has rubbed off on us.
  No pressure(!)
  No(!)
It's now or never for the lads.
They're in front of an unforgiving crowd looking for a new sound.
We're The Acrylics!
Add a few A&R people and some promoters,
and the guys' confidence is tested to the max.
Don't forget me Don't forget me...
The band hold their own and put all Saving Aimee's advice into action.
Whoa...!
They were brilliant, I really enjoyed it.
Spread the love!
  It was pretty good.
  I'll say.
  Amazing.
  Rock and roll!   I can't wait to do that again.
It's over now It's over now...
The last couple of days have been really good, it went really well.
The Acrylics have left the building.
  That's a wrap, boys.
  It's a wrap!
  Have some Acrylics love.
Yeah!
Great gig, guys. Now, turn up your telly
if you intend to be a hit in the love department.
Pucker up, because here's AJ with a quick guide to snogging.
50% of all people have their first kiss before 14,
but everyone's got to snog someone at some time,
so best to get it right from the start.
I'm here to meet Simone. Relationship expert,
agony aunt, and someone who is seriously in the know
when it comes to snogging.
It's a really big issue for teens. They worry about
when they're gonna get their first kiss,
then when they do it, will they be any good at it?
..There ain't no issues And no fuss
When it's just you and me
You and me...
What are some good top tips about being a good kisser?
Well, it sounds really obvious, but the first one
is to have nice smelling breath, so always carry gum or mints on you.
There is nothing worse than kissing someone who tastes of a burger.
What about technique?
If it's your first time kissing someone, then it is a tender moment,
so it's really important to stay relaxed,
and you've got to tilt your head as well,
or you'll bash into their nose, which won't be nice for either of you.
The most important bit of advice, I would say,
is don't go in there, all guns blazing
like it's a big, dramatic Hollywood kiss, cos real life ain't like that,
so the idea is, kiss them on the lips very, very gently,
then you can start introducing your tongue, and use different speeds.
Start off slowly, then you can quicken up the pace.
What about eyes? Are they open or closed?
Oh, come on, you know this! Close your eyes!
And also, as well, run your fingers through their hair
or the back of the neck. They really like that, that'll really work.
Cos what about when it goes horribly wrong?
Do you get letters from people
who think that their romantic life is completely shattered?
Yeah, I do, cos when it happens, it's really quite hurtful,
but I always say, "Good kissing takes practice,"
so just give yourself time, don't worry about it.
..Gain composure
Before I lose it, gain composure
I'm gonna breathe...
Well, one thing that's clear is that everyone gets nervous about kissing
at some stage, but remember, it takes two, baby,
so don't worry, take your time, and wait for the right moment
with the right person, and the sparks will fly for you.
Mwah!
They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach,
and the way to a woman's   well, let's face it, it's no different.
Take Jordan   he is so bad at cooking, he could burn a salad.
It's a wonder he's so popular with the ladies.
16 year old Sussex boy Jordan can't cook,
and thinks a balanced diet is leftovers in the kitchen.
My relationship with the kitchen...
and cooking is...non existent.
I just have no motivation to do it, cos my mum's good at cooking.
The nearest things that he gets to actually do for himself
is to get a bowl out of the cupboard, a packet of cereal,
possibly with some milk. He gets quite het up if there is no milk.
You've got to eat it fast, cos you don't want the flakes going soggy.
A self confessed greedy guts, Jordan feasts on five meals a day.
There's no fresh ingredients involved,
  just endless bowls of cereal...
  Shovelling it in.
..microwave meals...
  Food!
  And his biggest favourite  
chocolate spread on toast.
And when it comes to having a few mates round, they know better than to expect posh nosh at Jordan's.
He's only ever made me toast once. Wasn't even done that well.
He tried to cook pasta once but he forgot to put the water in.
So he was frying pasta in a pan!
Even Jordan's love life has been affected
by his serious lack of cooking skills.
He bought my a packet of chocolates once, and we had that for dinner.
Apart from that, nothing. I think men should cook.
If Jordan's gonna survive in the big wide world,
he's going to have to raise his game in the kitchen.
When I go off to get a flat by myself
I'd have to be able to put together something decent,
so I'd like to know in the back of my mind I could always resort to that.
But his belly isn't the only thing Jordan wants to satisfy
with new cooking skills.
If a boy can cook, it's attractive to girls. They love it.
And I wanna widen my appeal, so...
Help is on its way. Chef, cookery writer and TV presenter
Sophie Michell is going to help Jordan cook up a storm.
I think young people sometimes find cooking difficult,
see it as something which is kinda boring,
but actually it can be so much fun. It's a real social skill.
Jordan has no idea who his cooking mentor will be.
I'm hoping that it's a Swedish hottie,
but I think I'll probably get an old grey haired cookery master.
Never get what you want these days.
  Hi, Jordan.
  Hiya.
  I'm Sophie.
  Nice to meet you.
  I've heard you're having huge problems in the kitchen.
  Yes.
Don't mind cooking in the kitchen with her, let's go!
  What would you most want to do, if you could cook?
  Erm...
  Impress the ladies?
  Yes.
  Impress your friends?
  Impress the ladies, most definitely.
First, Sophie wants to get an idea
of the extent of Jordan's cooking skills.
If it uses eggs, I'm halfway there. I can make scrambled eggs.
Now I know you make scrambled eggs,
I wouldn't mind seeing you make me an omelette.
Oh, I didn't wash my hands.
Look at that!
  I'm feeling a bit more at home with the kitchen, I think.
  You sure?
Jordan thinks he's already got the skills to impress Sophie.
Er...yeah.
Well...
After eating Jordan's omelette,
  Sophie digests the scale of the problem facing her.
  Horrible!
He can't cook anything, basically. So I do have my work cut out,
but when he learns how to do this properly,
he's got the kind of memory which will
then be able to follow through, hopefully.
Let the lesson begin.
Step one   chopping.
This is one of the key skills that people don't know
how to do properly, quickly.
I'm gonna stop you now, cos number one, you've still got your skin on.
I knew it!
Next, garlic. And squash it.
Garlic, again, your base ingredient for sauces, pasta, etc.
Yeah, I love garlic.
As the lesson progresses,
Jordan can't resist the opportunity to clown around.
No, no! Aaah!
Jordan's one of these guys always making everyone laugh,
but he has to knuckle down and learn the skills properly.
So in goes the tomato...
Step two   learn the basics of making a wicked tomato sauce.
Tasting is the most important thing.
Flavours kind of merge together...
Amalgamating.
The worst thing you can do with pasta is overcook it.
You don't want it soft. You want it to have a bite to it.
That looks lovely.
Step three   slap in the protein. Grilled chicken is plain and simple.
Obviously you have to be intelligent and use common sense for cooking,
but a thinner bit of chicken is gonna take less time to cook,
so be clever with it all.
  I like this, this is really easy to do.
  Looks good.
This is gonna be the base for a bruschetta and a crostini.
Finally, posh toast for starters   with no chocolate spread in sight.
So are you feeling confident? You reckon you can do that quite easily?
Yeah, I do.
Well, that's good, because tomorrow I have a challenge for you.
  A young lady called Abi is coming round for dinner.
  Abi?
  And I want you to cook...
  She knows I'm so bad at cooking!
The menu is chicken penne arrabiata alla Jordan...
and I want it to be cooked properly!
  Because I will find out if you haven't been doing that...
  Chicken what what what?
You learned all the components of it.
You learned how to cook pasta, make tomato sauce.
Arrabiata is tomato sauce with chilli.
'I do think he's got what it takes to cook
'a great meal for his date tomorrow night.'
It just depends if he thinks about it cos he has a tendency
to go off and kind of be silly for a bit.
Now, tomorrow will be easy.
All you have to do is remember everything I told you.
If you don't, you're stuffed.
My mind's gone blank. It's like the whole day's been a blur.
Which I suppose isn't a good thing.
But I'm hoping once I start the first thing tomorrow,
it'll all come running back to me.
But I'm just worried that if I lose my momentum
it's all going down the drain.
We'll get back to Jordan in a bit to find out if the kitchen
is still there.
Sorry, to see how he gets on.
Now here's how to bind fond farewell to the one you once loved,
or, more to the point, how to dump 'em.
Had enough of the other half but don't know how to dump 'em?
Do it properly and you can move on with a smile on your face.
Ditching by text or e mail is too cruel, and the day
before an exam just isn't cool.
Do the sensitive thing and rise to the challenge face to face.
Tell it to 'em straight.
Before you do the deed, make a list of the reasons why you want out.
It'll be easier to explain.
Made up excuses will come back to haunt you,
the old "it's me, not you" line is definitely one to avoid.
Pick a neutral, quiet place. Doing the deed in front of your mates
will just make you look bad.
And don't be talked out of it. If it's the right thing to do,
why delay the inevitable?
They'll be happier in the long run,
and you'll be free to get on with your own life.
Now you've dumped 'em, you've more time to hone your cooking skills,
and find someone else. So let's catch up with Jordan and find out
if it's a dog's dinner, or a dinner fit for a king.
It's the day of Jordan's dinner date,
and he's out buying ingredients.
Yeah, cos I've been shopping before...
Some of Sophie's passion for cooking may have rubbed off.
I'm actually dead serious that I want to do this well,
so I've got to start getting it right from the off
Confidence is high as Jordan gets cracking on his penne arrabiata.
I wanna prove myself!
First up, fry the garlic on a low heat.
Er, that's not a low heat, is it, Jordan?
Look, it's all getting stuck to the bottom already.
I may be the biggest numpty in the world.
As Jordan feels the heat, his date Abi is also less than confident
as she gets ready for the feast.
I'd like him to TRY to cook a romantic meal,
but he's never cooked a meal for me, ever. I don't know
how much I'm going to enjoy it, to be honest.
Can't see what I'm doing, I hate onions, they really upset me...
Jordan starts again, and after some emotional onion chopping...
It's just that I can't remember what she told me yesterday, so...
His tomato sauce begins to take shape.
  Kind of.
  It's got a burnt onion twang to it.
Aaah!
And add to pasta?
But will Jordan's cuisine live up to the hype?
At least the bruschetta should be a nice, easy starter.
Can't even see.
As Jordan juggles char grilling chicken and tending to tomato sauce,
hasn't he forgotten something?
Oh...I didn't turn off the...
Never, ever leave food in the oven without regularly checking.
Fortunately, it's just the bruschetta that's cremated.
This is what kind of danger I can be in the kitchen.
If you think you can do better, check out the recipe
on the Almost Perfect pages on the Switch website.
Ex girlfriend Abi arrives just in time for the burnt posh toast.
  Hello, how are you?
  I'm good, thanks.
  Take a seat.
You've got an amazing starter there for you.
  Thanks so much.
After the burnt bruschetta,
will the penne arrabiata alla Jordan
get his date's all important seal of approval?
Oh, I burnt the chicken.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it's nice. Something's really spicy. Is it meant to be spicy?
Yes, it's chilli.
  OK, I was just checking!
  I think it's perfect.
Little tiny bit cold, though. Like, the tiniest bit.
Well done for not killing me. No, it was really nice,
and it was edible. And I suppose this time last week
you would not have been able to do that.
Congratulations. I'm very proud. Really, really proud.
It's a weird sense of power you get from cooking,
it's kind of like, "Yeah, I'm controlling what I'm eating."
As long as I fine tune the skill,
my life with the females could be spiced up quite a bit.
That looked good enough to eat, Jordan.
Well...sort of.
Hopefully today's show has taken you one step closer
to almost perfection,
and remember you can get all this and more at the Almost Perfect pages
on the Switch website.
That's all for now, see you next time. Bye.
