Sonali and I in the house tonight. And boy, have we got a jam packed
show for you tonight, including: I am checking out the new cinema
experience, 4D. And the mission to save the world's
only mammal with poisonous teeth. As soon as 3D movies hit cinema
screens they ruled the box office. Films like Avatar and Up won loads
of awards too. Now, movie bosses are hoping to make your cinema
experience EVEN better   with 4D. Leah's been finding out all about
it. Prepare to get closer than you Imagine being in the cinema and
being able to feel the rain on your skin or the wind in your hair. Or
the bad breath of this guy. Well that's 4D cinema on a whole new
I liked it when all the effects happen, like your chair was moving
and water was spilling out at you. Did you not find it distracting
with too much going on? I found that it added more to the film and
made it more exciting. What did you make of the 4D movie? When the Bath
came out of Big Ben. When the hulks sneezed. What did you feel? Lots of
water. Were you scared? No. That's what the kids think. I'm going pop
I've seen lots of 3D films in the past but what makes this really
cool is when your seats move and water sprays out at you. It was
nine minutes long and I don't think I could handle that for an entire
movie. 4D cinema is already really popular in Korea and from the
reaction from these guys, it'll only be a matter of time before 4D
will be a hit here too. What do you reckon, guys? Yeah!. In Korea, they
turned Avatar into 4D. I have been to a 4D movie in Rome, it was like
a Coliseum felt. I bowled a bit sick. Your chair is moving.   
Coliseum a film and I felt a bit In the day's other news, a Cheryl
Cole hair advert has escaped being given the chop. 40 people
complained that this L'Oreal ad was misleading because Cheryl is
actually wearing hair extensions. That meant they didn't believe that
the shampoo could make ordinary hair look this great. But
advertising officials say tests still showed it worked on people
who didn't have hair like Cheryl. The England squad are travelling to
South Africa this evening   without Theo Walcott. In fact, Fabio
Capello has picked England's oldest ever World Cup squad. Some people
are saying it's a shame that 21  year old Walcott is being left at
home, but as well as being the oldest, this year's squad is also
the most experienced   with a record total of 900 caps between
them. Now to the animal rescue mission to
save one of the strangest mammals on the planet. It's been described
as a cross between an anteater and a rat.
It's been around since the time of the dinosaurs, but experts are
trying to make sure it doesn't end up extinct like the T rex and his
friends. These animal experts are in the
Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, on the hunt for one of the oldest
mammals in the world. After three nights of searching, they finally
catch a glimpse of the mysterious creature they're looking for.
Because these animals are so rare, even the experts are excited to at
last come face to face with a solenodon. I have been obsessed
with this species since I was a little kid. It is completely a
lifelong dream, not only to have seen one but two have a life
solenodon in my hand at the moment. It is a little bit too much. This
weird looking creature uses its long nose to sniff out insects and
its sharp claws for burrowing into the ground. And   just so you know
  apparently it smells like a wet goat! The researchers have to wear
gloves when they handle the solenodon because it's the only
mammal in the world that has a poisonous bite. The bizarre beast
has been around since the time of the dinosaurs, more than 76 million
years ago, but now it's facing We are worried about the solenodon
because it has lost of it    blast a lot of its forest habitat    it
has lost a lot. There are new threats like being attacked by dogs,
and we have very little information on the species. These experts are
ancient solenodons find ways to survive for many more years to come.
We Missen    we wish them good luck with the effort to save the
The latest on the oil spill drama is that the American
government has started a criminal investigation into the disaster.
The country's top lawyer says they're going to be looking into
how people reacted to the crisis and whether anyone lied to
officials. Six weeks on, the oil company BP is still trying to block
the leak. Now to some incredible pictures of
a tornado blowing across the state of Colorado in America. The man
chasing this storm got as close as 50 metres away to capture these
shots. It went on the rampage for three hours and made hailstones as
big as tennis balls. Next, to a dog who decided to take
himself on a 31 hour long walk. His owners took him out on Sunday and
after he ran off they waited and waited but started to fear the
worst. However, it seems this adventurous pooch managed to cross
at least five main roads before making it home safely.
This is Jack. He might look perfectly happy playing in his
garden but this pooch likes to prowl. After his disappearing act
this Sunday his owners were really worried he wouldn't make it home.
never really believed he would come home but we always hoped he might.
Jack's owners were even more surprised at Jack's miracle journey
because the route home had so many main roads. We reckon the M1, the A
six to eight, the A 637, the A 638, the A six to nine. That is a lot of
roads. But against all the odds, this little fella did make it home.
We were lost for words when he turned up. He has always been one
to walk long distances, but this is something different that he has
done. We can't really put it into Finally, to a guy in Germany who
really stepped up to a challenge. He was taking part in a competition
