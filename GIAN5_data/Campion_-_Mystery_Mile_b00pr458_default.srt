I don't like lady pianists.
That is my good friend, Judge Lobbett.
< Very courageous of him to come in here. He's a marked man, you know.
< Four murders in his household in one month,
and each time, he has escaped.
Travelling for his health, perhaps.
Like I am. He'll be safe in England.
Your police will have to keep him in a steel box, if they're going to look after him.
Brava!
Those are his children with him.
  Senora Verola, ladies and gentlemen.
And now...
  ..mystery!
Prince Samir, the world famous Indian illusionist,
has very kindly consented to entertain us.
Oh, good! I'm potty about conjurers!
  Prince Samir! >
My name is Barber. Alistair Fergusson Barber. I am Turkish,
but I had a Scotch ancestor.
  Scottish.
  Yes.
I'm in the fine art business.
  An expert?
  Yes.
My good friend Judge Lobbett is a collector. Very enthusiastic.
Very cle ver!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Prince Samir will show you his most remarkable trick  
the greatest he has ever performed.
< Now, ladies and gentlemen,
< with this cabinet, I will make disappear anyone who will help me.
I shall make that person disappear and reappear, and if after that,
someone can tell me how it was done, I shall throw myself into the sea.
Now, who will be the first? You, sir?
Oh, no. I am too old for these adventures!
Ah, here.
  I'LL disappear!
  You'll have to wait your turn, young man.
I shall ask this gentleman to step in here. I shall close the doors,
and when I open them again, he will be gone... If you please.
  But you asked ME first!
  You are making a darn nuisance of yourself.
I am genuinely interested in this experiment, as everyone else is. SLOW HANDCLAP
You're spoiling it for everyone. Now, if you'll please excuse me...
I said, excuse me...!
You fool! The whole cabinet is alive!
Switch the power off! Clear the lounge, please.
There has been a slight accident, but no one has been hurt. >
  Who's responsible for this? My father might have been killed!
  No one. It was an accident.
  In moving the piano...
  I don't believe it was an accident!
All right, Marlowe. Someone knew I couldn't resist a conjurer...
  But we won't discuss it here.
  Please will you clear the area!
Never this has happened before! Never! Never!
You too, sir.
  You saw what happened, sir. Do you think it was deliberate?
  Yes.
  Well, then, I guess you saved my father's life.
  A pleasure.
Well, thank you. We owe you.
If there's anything I can do for you in London, please ring me.
I shouldn't think we'll meet again on the ship. We humble artisans feel dreadfully out of place up here.
I'm scared, Marlowe. More scared than I was at home.
It's gonna be all right, kid.
  If only the old man wasn't so damn obstinate.
  Taxi!
  Is that Mayfair 3925?
  'That's right.'
  Who d'you want?
  'Oh, it's all right.'
  I wanted to speak to a Mr Campion.
  Oh. Can I have your name please, sir?
  Lobbett. Marlowe Lobbett.
  Listen carefully, sir, you want
Bottle Street police station, off Piccadilly. Side door on the right. Up the stairs to the top.
  No connection with the police station.
  Can I come right away?
  Shall we say two ish?
  'Two o'clock   I'll be there.'
Pleased to see you. Goodbye, sir.
Where's Dad?
  Gone out, I think.
  Well, go find him!
  And don't let him out of your sight.
  I'm going with you.
Isopel, please!
Come in.
Thank you.
Here...
I live next door to a police station because of my more doubtful acquaintances.
  I've come to you as a last chance.
  Yes. People generally do. Have some of this. It's all my own work.
It contains almost everything except tea.
  Now, what did the police say to you this morning?
  How do you know about...?
  Ah!
A police hair, my dear Watson. Come and sit down.
  They were no help?
  They wouldn't guarantee my father's safety.
  No. The New York police wouldn't either, would they?
  No.
He just won't let the police look after him their way.
He's never been afraid of 'them', and he's not gonna begin now.
  He's not crazy, he just feels that way about it. You see what I'm up against?
  Not quite.
  But I thought...
  Some idea. Have you any idea who 'they' are?
  Probably a gang run by Simister.
  Does that name mean anything to you?
  It does indeed.
Can you tell me anything about this man   Simister? Is he a gangster, a master crook,
or is it a powerful gang using the word as a sort of trade name? Does Simister exist?
Somewhere on this earth, there is a man called Simister.
He may be a bogle, he may be a devil, but he's a real power of evil.
I've talked to crooks, police, even members of his own gang, but none of them have seen him.
He's the voice on the telephone,
the shadow, the hand that turns out the light in the crook play...
but with one big difference.
He's never caught...and they say no one ever escapes him.
  Why your father?
  It's revenge, we think.
  Why?
  When one of the Simister gang was caught, Dad gave it him hot.
  Not unjust, just hard.
  Is that all?
Well, Dad won't talk about it. We can only guess.
  Well?
  I believe Dad had something definite on the Simister gang,
but I can't figure out what it is.
I hope that what you think is not true. Revenge is one thing, but if he has a line on these people,
  what can
  do? What can ANYONE do?
The fabulous sums spent on hiring Mr Campion's assistance are wasted.
I told you...you're my last hope.
What you're saying is, "Here's a nice war. Come and join it."
  Archdeacon won the first race.
  Oh, good.
Now, I can get dressed. I had my shirt on that horse. Excuse me.
Hold on. Stop Press: "Judge Crowdy Lobbett, an American, narrowly missed a serious accident
"when a taxi mounted the pavement near his hotel in The Strand
"and crashed through a shop window this morning. No one was injured."
  God, he doesn't know where I am! Poor Isobel. She'll be terrified. I must go!
  Wait for me!
I'm in this.
I knew it!
Giles! Swithin! He's here!
Ill met by daylight, proud Sir Giles!
Well, how you've grown!
  And by all that's unholy, the Reverend Swithin Cush!
  Hello, Albert.
Now, man of mystery... spill the beans.
  You're serious? The ancestral home is to let?
  If anyone will take it.
We're a bit pushed for tinkle. We had horrible death duties when the old guv'nor died.
And farming simply isn't paying.
  But all the villagers expect us to go on employing and paying them.
  I have a suggestion.
  want a remote country house for a particularly peppy job I'm doing.
  For how long?
  A fortnight or so.
Mrs Whybrow, how marvellous! You read my dreams.
I can see that you're wondering where the slow music comes in.
  Have you heard of Judge Lobbett?
  We DO read the papers (!)
< The old boy they're always trying to kill?
  Are you in on that?
  Up to the neck.
He's stirred up a hornets' nest in America, and it seems they've followed him here.
But he refuses to be helped.
Luckily, he's fond of folklore and ancient English customs. That's why he's coming...
to pretend to be Lord of the Manor.
I shall rely on you, Vicar, for the archaeology and history.
I'm just the man for that   anything to do with the devil!
  Oh, and he's fond of paintings.
  Ours aren't much, I'm afraid.
  Oh, they look all right.
He's willing to rent the place for Â£50 a week.
  It's a pity you have to move out.
  Oh, we'll move into the Dower House.
Do you expect trouble, Albert?
I don't see how we can escape it. But in a place like this, if there are any strangers about,
we'll know. I'll need your help.
  It's about time something happened round here!
  I'm in it too!
Oh, no, Biddy, this is men's work. Not your sort of show.
I'm staying, or the whole deal's off.
If the Judge's daughter is going to be here, so am I.
Besides, what would you three poor fish do without me?
Tell her this is no place for the tender sex.
As the bard said, "I do remain as neuter." But I usually obey Biddy.
  You're making this very awkward...
  Oh, don't be a fool, silly old dear.
I'm with you to the death, you know that.
Although you're a foreigner and not likely to be used to our ways, all the same, we welcomes you.
We hopes you do your best to keep up the old ways and do all you can for us. Now, we'll sing a hymn...
Oh, you come upon me unawares, Mr Campion!
  I was saying a few words I be going to speak for the visitors.
  Speech of welcome?
  Summat like that.
The rector was all for singing, but me being church warden, seems only right I should do the greeting.
Don't bother with a speech, George. Aren't there some local customs   maypolings and what not?
Oh...not give a speech?
Well, you knows best, sir. But maypoling time's past, and Pharisee's Day ain't come yet.
None of these feasts are moveable?
  Oh, no, you can't alter the days, not for nobody.
  Pity.
  No, no, there's nothing...
  Unless it be Owl Friday.
  It's not Friday.
  Owl Friday can be any time.
Me and my brother, Henry, we make powerful owls, especially if our whistles be wetted with good beer.
  Yes. Good idea, George,
  excellent, but save your breath for whistle wetting time.
  You just give me the word!
We're the men for you, sir!
Yes, I do believe you are.
Albert, I've been looking for you everywhere.
We've shown them the house and they're just charmed about it.
  Sounds awfully handsome, don't you think?
  Wait till you see ME in my new ballgown!
Jealous!
  I like that painting, Sir Giles. Romney?
  Not genuine, I'm afraid,
or it would have been sold. My father called it our "faux" Romney.
Would you think it very rude of me if I had it authenticated?
  At my expense, of course.
  Not in the least.
I should have had it done ages ago.
It is a lovely place.
I congratulate you, Mr Campion, on your choice on our behalf.
I hope the children won't find it too quiet.
I know you'll all excuse me.
  You weren't followed?
  I think they were waiting for us in London,
but your fellow, Lugg, put them off the scent.
Yes, he has a genius for misleading people.
We'll leave the place to you now.
The housekeeper has prepared everything for you, she's wonderful.
And come and have dinner with us this evening.
Oh, Miss Paget...
..I'm so glad you're here.
Thank goodness the Judge fell for it.
Nice old boy. Not unlike the governor, only American.
Same direct way of looking at you and saying exactly what comes into his head.
And what a girl! What a girl!
Would you say her eyes were blue...
or brown? Or a sort of heather mixture?
"Gilles..."   Giles.
Giles, of course! "Giles Paget, the son of...
  Hubert.   "Hubert.
  "Holds of the King... nine...caricates"?   Mmm.
< "..of land, in the hundred... of Mist Mile..."
Yes, Mist Mile is the old name. Our creek is full of mist when the rest of the coast is clear.
"There is land for seven ploughs,
< "woodland for ten swine, meadow, one league in length, for 30 sheep."
Well, if I'm to be Lord of the Manor, I'd better buy some swine and sheep!
I can find you a second hand plough! HOOTING
An owl! Did you hear it?
I wonder what it means?
  I think it means a visitor.
God bless my soul!
"Mr Anthony Datchett. Palmist."
  Not a gatecrasher, I hope.
  Datchett, of course! He's THE palmist!
A fortune teller! Now, that IS interesting. Is he a gypsy?
  No, sir. It's a gentleman.
  An extraordinary chap.
He goes round houses after dinner shelling out the past and future for five bob.
  A character.
  Let's have him in!
Why not? It's always instructive to be told what's going to happen.
< Mr Datchett.
May I introduce myself more fully?
My name is Anthony Datchett. I am an itinerant palmist.
I should be delighted if one or two of you would let me give a reading.
If I do... I can promise you one thing.
The truth. >
Tell me.
Certainly.
Shall we go over there? It is better without an audience, to be frank.
The only man who told my fortune was an income tax inspector.
Did he tell you about Owl Friday?
..Now, would you like to see to see my own brand of magic?
It's called the Three Card Trick, or Spot The Lady.
Now, Miss, which is your money on?
I say! Now then, Marlowe, Keep your eye on the cards.
Judge?
  Not a lady spotter in the house.
  You could make a living with that trick!
  I did, madam.
I kept a wife and three kids in comfort. Albert the Card was famous on the racecourses of Britain.
Then one day, alas, the law came down on Albert's shoulder. When I got out of the clink,
it was Albert the good and upright, as you see him now.
  What a story!
  Are you still married?
Mr Campion is a habitual and congenital liar.
He's quite astounding. Biddy, you really should get him to tell your fortune.
He said I was thinking of entering a horse for the Suffolk Show.
That's obvious, but he knew I would send a HUNTER, not a mare and foal.
Only two days ago, I decided not to send a mare and foal,
but to put Oliver in. I hadn't told a soul...
even our groom, even Biddy. He's got second sight, that man.
  Or he's done his homework.
  The Reverend seems interested.
Yes! I do hope he's promising him lots of adventures. He's had such a quiet life.
No. Swithin's note is tranquillity.
That seems to be the note of the whole place!
What luck did you have?
I'm too old to have any fortune at all. I must go to bed, I know you'll understand.
We keep early hours in the country. ..No, please don't get up. Goodnight.
It's rather late, I'm afraid. I can tell one more fortune...
Let it be someone to whom I can promise nothing but happiness.
Will you permit me to tell yours?
Yes.
Goodnight, my dear.
Give my love...to Giles.
Although you will not marry one of your own people, your domains will be wide,
you will know the peace which is the lowing of kine over small meadows. That is your fortune.
It is a pity that I cannot promise as much to you all.
Adieu.
  Thank you for coming.
  A pleasure.
Your money.
Sir, Alice is in the kitchen. She's brought this from the Reverend.
"Giles and Campion, come over alone. Swithin."
He wouldn't part with his ring unless it was important.
We'd best humour him. See what he wants.
Datchett also knew my favourite brand of cigars. Extraordinary...
No! Leave I go, Miss Biddy!
< He asked for Giles and Mr Campion.
No... Let me go in first.
All right.
Albert!
String tied to the trigger. It's the usual way.
Oh, God. Poor old Swithin.
  Who is Henry Topliss?
  The Coroner.
  Sorry, I couldn't stop her.   He shot hisself...
Lord, have mercy on his soul!
Not in his chair! I'll not sit in his chair. The chair of the dead.
Rector dead.
I'll take Alice along. She's my sister. My wife'll take care of her.
She looked after he so long, this'll come like a shock to her, like.
Goodnight.
  Goodnight.
  George...
  Don't rouse the village.
  No, sir. Mouth shut best at a time like this.
What, in the name of creation, does it all mean?
You knew him as well as we did. Why would he DO that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
How horrible...
Over here, all in the dark.
  I'd better get Sergeant Peck and the old Doc from Herenhoe.
  Yes, we'll stay here.
This was on the desk, next to the letter to the Coroner.
It's for you.
"Forgive me and pray for me.
"My temptation was great. I succumbed to it.
"All my love to you, my child.
"Tell Albert about our longest walk."
I mean, what WAS the temptation?
Why did he choose such an odd time, just after that man was here?
Albert...that man killed Swithin.
  Oh, come on now, Biddy.
  That nasty little man told him something.
  He said something that made Swithin kill himself.
  It's far fetched.
  Do you think he was just an ordinary fortune teller?
  No.
That bird was up to something fishy   that exercise in telepathy.
That stuff he told Giles was pretty bright.
  Could that man have come here because of the Judge? Could he be Simister?
  There's always a chance.
That's from his best set.
Poor St Swithin. He must have gone potty.
I think he is trying to tell us something.
What about this "longest walk"?
We've been for so many walks. One day, everyone thought we'd got lost. That must have been the one.
Tell me.
We crossed the Stroud...
'and went on to the farther salting. Then we turned back.
'The sky and the water the same colour...
'When we got back near here, there's a big pool of quicksand,
'people here call it The Soft.
'That must have been what he meant. "Danger."'
Biddy...my dear child...
we all have to die... in this wicked world...
and I'm not afraid of it at all.
But if and when I do... If something terrible should happen after my death...
Oh, come on, Swithin, you're not going to die, not for years.
If something terrible should happen, I want you to visit Alaric Watts.
  Yes, I remember him.   Good. And you promise?
  Yes, but what on earth...?   No more questions.
Let's go and have an enormous tea,
cream buns and strawberry jam.
I'm famished.
  Who is Alaric Watts?
  Another parson. He was Swithin's best friend. A keen archaeologist.
But Swithin had never heard of the Lobbetts then.
He had when he wrote this note. And when he sent me this.
..Alice, Sir Giles has gone for the police and the doctor.
I'll wait for him.
You go to your beds.
I looked after him in life, I'll look after him in death.
He's old.
He wouldn't want nobody but me.
Goodnight, dear.
Ah, Mr Campion. It is good of you to come over so late.
  Help yourself to a drink. I guess you can do with one.
  Yes, indeed.
This is a terrible business. A terrible, terrible business.
Death seems to follow me like gulls follow a ship.
I...reckon that you and I ought to understand each other, before we go any further.
You see, I don't know much about you and I feel that I'm following your instructions without knowing why.
Marlowe engaged you to look after me, am I right?
  You're not a policeman, are you?
  No. Though recommended, I believe.
I suggested you come here because I believed you'd be safer here.
How much do you know?
In New York, they were just trying to frighten you.
They didn't know how much you knew, but thought you had a line on them.
Then they realised you had a definite line, so they decided to kill you. You escaped.
I think you're close to knowing the true identity of Simister.
That you've got a clue you can't quite decipher.
Well, I don't mind telling you that when I first saw you, Mr Campion,
I thought you were the biggest damn fool ever made.
Now, I wonder if you might not be some sort of telepathy expert,
like our ginger bearded friend.
I've got one end of the string, but if they get wind of it,
my fear is that they'll cut it higher up
and I'll lose the one chance of stopping this thing.
It's ME against Simister, and I don't want to involve anyone else.
  Wouldn't one ally be useful?
  No. No one.
Not my children, the Pagetts, or the police.
I'm not any of those.
Well, I'm an old fool not to welcome your help. But NO police.
No police.
So the inquest is over, eh?
Extraordinary, that bit in Swithin's letter to the Coroner about the incurable disease.
Swithin was no more ill than I am. It wasn't true. I don't understand.
It is the most common form of delusion. Once someone believes...
Kettle, Your Honour. From the shop... Your post, sir.
My daughter says, "There's the Judge. Why don't you just nip out with his post?"
  Well, I'm very obliged to you.   Oh, no, sir.
It's my pleasure to oblige you and your family, sir.
  Anything you require from the shop, tell me and I'll send it over.   Thank you, Mr...?
Kettle, Your Honour.
  Well, he seems very obliging.
  Rather an oily fellow. No one can stick him, or his daughter.
Trouble is, he's a foreigner.
  Oh?   Oh, yes. He comes from Ipswich.
Oh!
  I wonder who would be writing me here? May I?
  Of course.
Oh, Lord, I forgot all about this! I had written to some people about your painting, Giles.
A man's coming tomorrow. I'll put him off.
I would feel ungracious to have him around at a time like this.
Please don't let this make any difference. Swithin never disobliged anyone in his life.
  Biddy's right.
  They're sending a man called Alistair Barber. I know him slightly.
Albert!
  What was the verdict?
  "Suicide during temporary insanity." Did you see the parson?
Alaric Watts? Yes. Nice man. Very upset about Swithin, that's all.
  Perhaps he HAD gone potty.
  Or the "serious trouble" hasn't begun yet.
  What about the red chessman?
Biddy, promise me, never, ever say ANYTHING about the red chessman.
I promise.
Bravo!
  Brilliant! Albert, we won!
  It's a knack I acquired in China.
  Albert's marvellous!
  I excel at all vicious games.
  Well, now, where is this maze they tell me about?
  Over there.
  On the other side of the garden.
  Come on, we'll show you.
Albert?
I'm sorry Dad wrote to that art fellow.
  Rather gave our whereabouts away.
  Alistair Barber, yes.
Oh, don't worry, he's quite harmless.
Though, like all experts, he talks too much.
Worse than a movie star's confessions!
This is a fine maze!
We used to have such fun playing here when we were children.
  Is this the entrance?   That's right.
Ah!
  Do you want to know the key?   No, that would be cheating. I'll find my own way.
It's not difficult really.
My own tour of the maze, which the Judge has missed,
will be conducted by the world expert on trigonometry.
I shall charge a small fee.
Have you found the centre yet, Mr Lobbett?
< I believe I'm getting that way! HOOTING
< I don't believe this maze has got a middle! Are you coming?
Right ho. Just coming.
The key is, turn left whenever you can!
  Giles! Have you found him yet?
  Still looking!
Dad?
Mr Lobbett?
Mr Lobbett!
Keep turning left!
Funny. I'll go back to the centre. You search the blind alleys.
  You go in, Marlowe.
  I wouldn't.
  Leave it to the professionals.
Mr Lobbett! Can you hear us?
No sign of him, Giles.
Try that false way out.
Dad! Answer me!
  This is crazy! He must be there! Is there another way out?
  No. A maze never has a second door.
He's foxing.
He's lost, but he won't let on.
  He's gone, Albert.
  He can't have.
  We've searched every inch.
I knew something like this would happen! They've followed us here!
I knew we wouldn't get away from them! We've roused the devil! There's some evil power dogging us!
There's something we can't escape!
Please don't disturb yourself.
I have an appointment.
Ah!
I say!
  Hello!
  (Oh, God, it's that damned picture dealer.)
So nice to see you again, Mr Lobbett.
  Miss Pagett.
  A pleasure, Miss Pagett.
Alistair Fergusson Barber. And...
I don't believe it... My companion from the ship!
  Mr Albert...Memorial! I never forget a name!
  A slip of the tongue.
  Campion. Albert Campion.
  Yes!
Always joking. ..Your father asked me to look at a picture for him.
  I'm afraid...
  Judge Lobbett isn't available just now.
  If you let me know where you can be contacted, I'll telephone you.
  No, I will wait!
I have plenty of time. And what is time in a beautiful place like this?
This paradise! This is the very soul and spirit of England!
  When I look round, my heart flies up to Heaven like the crow...
  Lark.
The crow does not fly to Heaven.
Look, the clouds of Constable... Ah!
  Where is the painting?
  Painting?
  THE painting. The supposed Romney.
Ah... Follow me.
  What are you doing?
  Sssh!
Who are you, anyway?
Alistair Fergusson Barber.
I am waiting for Judge Lobbett. I have a commission from him. And who are you?
  Giles Pagett. I live here.
  Then I must congratulate you, Sir Giles, on your beautiful house,
but not on the state of your paintings. This one, for example,
it may be beautiful, perhaps valuable, but who can tell under all that grime and varnish?
And this fine Girtin   nearly ruined by the damp.
  Would you put this painting back?
  But I must finish my photographing.
  Finish it, and then go.
  But I am waiting for Judge Lobbett.
  He's not here.
  Where is he, then?
  Please do as I say!
Sir Giles...
You hope this IS by Romney, eh?
At the moment, I really don't care WHO painted it!
  Any luck?
  I don't know. Look at this.
That's the only place anyone could have got in or out of the maze, bar the entrance.
He must have heard us shouting,
and there's no sign of a struggle.
  How could anybody get him out with no noise?
  I'll organise a search.
On your way!
Come in, please.
Have you anything to report?
Any of you?
Has anyone seen anything unusual at all? Speak up. Let's hear it.
None of us ain't seen nothing.
  He can't have vanished into thin air!
  I could find him, if anybody could.
I be smart at searching out anything that be alive, but none of us, we ain't seen nothing.
I shut up my shop right away and I've been searching ever since.
  We've done our best. I walked ten miles...
  I know. Thank you.
  Now, could someone have got the Judge away on a boat? Henry?
  No.
  My brother was on his boat all morning. He would have seen another boat.
  But when you were searching?
  The boy was there all the time.
  Yeah, I was there.
  And no mist in the tunnel either.
  What tunnel?
  The creek. There's usually mist in it.
A dip in the salting. The mist lies there. Wonderful place for snares!
..Used to be, I mean.
Thank you, all of you. Mrs Whybrow will give you beer in the barn.
Off you go.
You stay, George. This place is almost an island. The only way out is the causeway.
  No one's gone that way.
  I can vouch for that, sir.
  This is the maddest thing I've ever known!
I think we should have another look in the creek, in case they missed any footprints.
There are plenty of footmarks here.
  None down here.
  Wouldn't be though, would there?
  Why not?
  Oh, my Lord!
  The Soft.
Quicksands.
  Bom bom bom bom, bom bom bom...
  George is here, Miss.   Anything for the post, Miss Biddy?
These letters, thank you.
Would you write a label for me, now the old parson's gone?
  For my son in law, Reg Patten.   Two "t"s?
Yes. The Back Garage. Canvey Island.
Thank you kindly, Miss Biddy.
Sorry to bother you.
  "Wreathing and writhing and fainting in coils."
  Hardly any of them can write.
Why don't you DO something, Albert?
Like finding the Judge. All you do is make asinine remarks and tell the Lobbetts not to call the police,
when they're both ILL with worry!
I used to be pretty fond of you, but now, I think you're just cold and horrible and callous!
  Rough stuff.
  How dare you!
The sun has got his hat on! Hip, hip, hip, hooray!
The sun has got his hat on and he's coming out today!
We're over the moon We're up in the sky
Not a moment too soon We're learning to fly...
  It's good to see you, Lugg.
  Filthy things, trains. That one should be in a museum.
  It's been wandering about like it was lost.
  Would the local brew cheer you up?
  That depends.
  Found that Yankee judge you've lost?
  No.
  Not clever, for a professional.
  Yours is not to reason why, Lugg.
  As long as I don't have to do or die. I got your clean clobber.
  Thanks.
  How far is this mystery place?
  20 miles or so.
  20 miles? Do they still wear woad?
  Just about.
  You won't make me go there?
  No.
A messenger boy, that's all I am.
Left in Bottle Street... like a discarded toy!
Not bad... Bit thin. Expect they water it in this sort of place.
Did you speak to Oates?
The Chief Detective Inspector begged me to inform you
that Datchett is a con and blackmailer.
Sometimes, he sports a red beaver. Other times, his chin is quite bare.
He used to work the halls   legally.
Just about got time for another.
  Anything on Mr Barber?
  I spoke to your poncy mate,
him what pongs of 'Nuit D'Amour'.
He says Barber's rolling in it. Got harems all over the place.
  He says he's an art expert.
  Yes. He's a con woyseur of art.
  Perhaps women don't satisfy his every passion.
  ..The Simister gang?
Look...I've come to warn you.
You are ignorant compared to me. You don't know. They're a bad lot. Leave 'em alone!
TRAIN WHISTLES There's me train.
  Tell me if you know anything.
  Down at the club, there's an absence of the really nasty customers...
  Ikey Todd and that lot. I did hear Ropey's back in the country.
  Ropey?
  "Tis an infamy that such a bloke should exist." You know him!
  Mm. What do you suggest?
I know you won't take my advice, but I'd apply to Thomas Knapp.
I'm hanged if I will!
  I do not associate with Mr Thomas Knapp!
  I knew it. ..It's too late now.
We best go separate, just in case.
I shall wear a black band round my head for you,
and the funeral cars will cost a bit.
Thanks for the drink.
Here, don't forget your clobber!
  Thank God you're back, Albert. They've found the Judge's clothes.
  Who are "they"?
  Kettle's daughter, actually.
  Where did Miss Kettle find them?
  Saddleback Creek.
Albert...
Do try to be a little less... clinical.
  Definitely Dad's suit.
  Soaked in sea water and torn.
That's blood, isn't it?
Possibly. Nothing in the pockets?
No, nothing at all. All the pockets were pulled inside out.
I'm wanted in there. Show me in immediately! >
I'll do no such thing! They don't want to see you.
I'll go and send him away.
No. I think it would be a good idea to interview old cleversides.
Certainly.
Come in, Mr Kettle.
Thank you, Cuddy.
I saw your car come in, so I ran straight over, knowing you'll be wanting the truth.
  It was my daughter as found the remains...
  Is she here?
  No, sir.
You can imagine the condition she's in. The shock and the horror of it.
And I may mention, though I've offered myself, no one has yet sent for the police.
It'll look very suspicious when they do come.
Even though you are the son of the dead man, it will look nasty.
  What dead man? Have you got the body?
  Me, sir? Oh, no, sir.
When we find that, then I daresay we'll know who killed him.
  How was he killed?
  With a dagger.
  How do you know?
  It's a question of deduction.
Look, a jagged hole over the heart.
See these stains? It's blood. Heart's blood!
The victim was stabbed to death with a knife. >
And the clothes are sopping wet. What does that show?
  That they've been in water.
  Exactly!
Mr Lobbett was taken out to sea in a boat,
stabbed through the heart and thrown in the water.
Where he undressed, yes (!)
But there are one or two little matters that need to be explained.
The knife thrust   a hole nicked with scissors
and then made larger with a table knife.
Bloodstains only on the OUTSIDE of his clothes. The inside is clean.
I wonder if anyone's killed a chicken lately?
There's something fishy about this. Someone's been playing the fool with you, Mr Kettle.
I should go back to your Post Office, if I were you.
I'm sorry, I had to find out how much Sherlock knew.
  What do YOU make of these?
  A bad fake. Amateur stuff.
Not your father's New York friends.
  Probably local talent.
  But that was Dad's suit.
That's the only thing that makes it interesting.
Look, it's getting late, but first thing in the morning, I'll do some sleuthing of my own.
  You haven't seen Biddy, have you?
  No.
Well, we arranged to meet..
..to go for a walk together. She was going to show me the creek,
  but I can't find her anywhere.
  Really?
  You haven't seen Miss Biddy, have you, sir?
  No!
  Why?
  Miss Biddy said she'd go and get me some baking powder.
  Well, that was more than an hour ago...
  All right, Cuddy.
I've been rather stupid! Come on, Marlowe.
  If anything's happened to her, I'll commit murder.
  That's the spirit!
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
  Did Miss Pagett leave her purse here, Mr Kettle?
  Oh, no, no, no.
  She left nothing.
  Now we know where we are. Is she still in the house?
..Oh, don't be a fool. We'll turn you over to the police.
  Where is she?
  How dare you threaten and accuse me! You call the police!
I shall have something to tell them!
Where's Mr Lobbett, eh? Why don't you show them clothes to the police?
Because you daren't, that's why!
  Look, I'm not having this, sir!
  Shut the door.
It's a pity the window won't open,
or you could have got rid of the smell of chloroform.
If she's been hurt, I'll break my rule and kill you.
Now, the story so far   you make a mess of faking the Judge's clothes,
which sets us buzzing around your head...AND your own dirty employers.
They order you to kidnap the first of us that comes in here.
You apply the chloroform...
An innocent delivery van waiting outside...
  Where have they taken her?
  If they find out you know all this,
  they'll kill me! Don't tell them!
  Where?
  I dunno! I've never seen them before! I did as they said!
I wouldn't have done it if I could have helped!
I believe him. The nastiest thing we can do now is leave him to his pals.
Oh...!
Are you all right, sir?
  Well, if it isn't Albert himself! Huh!
  May I introduce you
  to Mr Thomas Knapp? Mr Lobbett.
  But I thought...
  Oh, your DAD has done a bunk. Pleased to meet you.
  How do you do?
What I've been through to get here!
I 'ad to pinch this in Colchester to get here.
  Did Lugg tell you I was here?
  Me and Maggers have interests in common.
YOUR interests. I 'appened to overhear something about you and this Lobbett business.
  What?
  Confidential.
  Interested?
  I might be.
  What did I tell you?
Me and Albert have worked together in the past. We're in the same style. We understand one another.
  Well, what is it?
  Oh, that's not like you, sir.
Ain't I gonna get offered any refreshment?
All the way from Colchester on this thing!
That's much better!
Yesterday afternoon, I 'appened to hear a very curious conversation on one of my new lines.
Mr Knapp used to work for the Government on telephone repairs.
Then he and the Post Master General had a slight misunderstanding and he retired from public life.
Since then, I've been using my electrical knowledge to my own advantage.
It's easy to listen on the line.
  You'd be amazed, the things I hear. Filth in high places.
  Yesterday...
There was these two blokes talking. One said, "Who sent the clothes?"
And the other said, "There was no message. Only the handwriting on the label."
"Ooh," said the other, "that's who you want."
Didn't mean nothing to me till the first bloke said, "Who's this Albert Campion?"
And the other said, "I'll find out about him." Then the first bloke says,
"If it was the girl, get her up here and we'll put her through it."
  One of your ladies may get into trouble.
  Miss Pagett's disappeared.
Ooh...
How much?
I'll make you a gentlemanly offer what I wouldn't if I didn't know you.
  Come on! It's no use to us unless you know WHERE they were speaking from.
  But I DO.
25 quid for the address. And another 25 when we get the girl back.
  I can't say fairer than that.
  You're on.
32, Beverley Gardens, Notting Hill Gate, Kensington. You got a scrap of paper on you?
I had a butcher's. They're there all right. Two heavies outside.
Now, the house where I hang out with my old mum backs on to Beverley Gardens.
You could make it your headquarters.
  We could nip across them roofs.
  Who's the boss?
Calls himself Datchett.
You know, as far as intelligence is concerned, you're coming on.
It's the picture man back.
He's the limit!
Sir Giles, may I be the first to congratulate you! Proof positive!
  Your Romney is genuine! Let us talk to Judge Lobbett.
  He's not here.
  Still not back?
  He's disappeared.
  Oh, you're joking, Sir Giles.
  My father's blood stained clothes were found yesterday.   But... But this is terrible!
  I'm sorry, Mr Barber.
  Terrible! I thought he was just away. My commission...
Just send me your account!
Thank you. If I can be of any help...
Ah! My friend! I...
Giles! Biddy's been kidnapped. Taken to London.
We think we know where she is. We must go there now,
  without the whole village knowing.
  Isopel...
  She can stay in my flat.
Mr Barber! We'd be very grateful if you could give us a lift to London.
A pleasure! I'm an excellent driver! And if you persuade Sir Giles
to let me handle the sale of his picture,
  the gratitude would be mine.
  Thank you!
If you get hungry, just shout down the lift. If you get scared, just shout at the policeman outside.
And if anyone calls, don't, whatever you do, open the door.
Especially if it's an old gentleman with a top hat and black gaiters... That's my wicked uncle.
Oh... You won't let Giles do anything silly, or Marlowe either? You WILL look after them?
As if they were my sons. Both young gentlemen will be under the direct care of matron.
  You don't know how it is to be in love.
  That's all YOU know, young woman!
Make room on the bed for Mr Barber, Mum. He don't look too happy there.
Think you're clever? Just when you're going into a really nasty business,
who do you get round you?
Two ruddy amateurs and something out of a carpet shop! Gawd! ..Oi!
Thomas! Don't lean against that wall.
It's ME what looks after your clothes!
  Did Mr Barber come willingly?
  With gentle persuasion, you might say.
He knew too much. Besides, we might need his car.
Mother'll keep him quiet. She's as good as a bull pup. ..Up here.
All given me by the government in unconscious recognition of my services.
Over here, Albert.
That's 32, Beverley Gardens, with the new chimney.
Just to the right... >
Just stay with me, dearie.
..No hurry. >
It's no good till it's dark anyway.
I'll buy for threepence.
I'll see ya.
Look, Mother, argue as much as you like,
five queens is five queens!
Are you accusing me of cheating?
All right, if these gentlemen will accept the fact, the packs may have got mixed up a bit.
  Time we went.   Right, gentlemen.
Well, so delighted to have been of service.
'The weather forecast and news summary will follow...'
Here...
Have a nice drop of rum.
Don't breathe a word, no one. If I whistle, drop.
  Just on the other side of that big skylight.
  Right.
London Telephone Service, madam. Tracing a fault.
I'm sorry our conversation hasn't been more fruitful, Miss Pagett.
I've a little work to do, so I'll leave you with Mr Ropey now. >
I'm sure we'll speak again soon. >
Come on, love. Spit it out. Where is Judge Lobbett?
We're sure you know. >
I don't wanna play noughts and crosses on your pretty face.
I don't know.
I've told you, I swear it...
  Emergency.
Fire. 32, Beverley Gardens, Notting Hill Gate. Could you send someone round to see it?
Thank you. And the police too.
'Fire! Fire! Get out quick!
'Fire! Police! Fire! Fire!'
Get Biddy out quickly, the way we came.
This way, this way. Trust Uncle.
Return tickets, please.
There we go.
Goodnight, Mr Datchett.
  Darling! Are you badly cut?
  A few stitches. Lugg knew a good doctor.
Good? Doc Redfern's a marvel. I'd be in four bits, if it wasn't for him!
  I think I'm going to cry now.
  Here, have a swig of this.
  Thank you.
  Imagine we're a Sunday newspaper.
Spare us nothing. Not one detail.
When I came to, I was in that house, with those awful men.
  That creepy fortune teller was the boss.
  He won't trouble us for some time.
They didn't kidnap your father and they thought I knew where he was.
How could you?
Because I wrote a label for George,
  so they assumed I had the Judge's clothes.
  George can't have had his clothes!
You do realise, don't you, that this is a death game? It was quite clear.
In the end, either their leader,
whom I didn't see, or Mr Lobbett is bound to die.
I've known it all along.
Right! Duff's up!
  The British burger is not a gastronomic success.
  What is it?
  Herrings in tomato sauce.
  Delicious!   Bloaters in blood. Brain food.
I got the first edition. "Mysterious outbreak. Arson suspected.
"Several men removed from the house are helping police with enquiries."
  < I could have done better myself.
  Hey! That looks like Dad!
"Diplodocus found in Suffolk. Archaeologist Rev. Alaric Watts,
  "of Redding Knights..."   Redding Knights?
  It looks like him.
  It IS Dad!
It is. Of all the utterly improbable pieces of bad luck.
It is your father. I put him there.
  You?
  Mea culpa. Well, me and your father, not forgetting George. A put up job.
  But if you...
Things were getting too hot   they pinked us the first evening. Then Swithin pointed the way...
  ..with this. Redding Knights was safe with Alaric Watts.
  But he disappeared in front of us!
Into the maze, down the ditch, change clothes, into George's boat,
and Watts waiting down the coast. George was to destroy the clothes.
But he said, "Waste not, want not,"
  and posted them to his son in law.
  Mr Kettle intercepted the parcel, which caused no end of bother.
Look, they're bound to get word of this, so speed is of the essence.
You'll all stay here with Lugg,
  while I return to Suffolk.
  I'm not!
  You are!
  I'm coming with you.
  Yes. All right, Giles.
No, you stay here, Giles. Keep an eye out. Anything suspicious.
I'm not sure. I really am not quite sure.
I would say it's never been used...
  Campion!
  No panic. Your family's all right.
  I've got Giles with me.
  What's wrong?
This.
"Our special photographer with a long distance camera
"manages to catch archaeologists at work." Disgusting!
Newspaper people spying on us!
And it's an Ichthyosaurus, not a Diplodocus!
They won't spell their own names right next! I must warn the museum.
It's a fine portrait of you, sir.
  As we say, my cover's blown sky high.
  Even higher.
This messes up your whole plan, Campion. I'm sorry.
I've been a fool.
  Look, you must drop this.
  This might be our chance to bring the big fish himself to the surface.
  No, I don't see that.
  We had a bit of a schemozzle with some of Simister's people in London.
Perhaps the Big Bezesus himself will turn up
  and make a personal affair of it.
  What's your idea?
Come back to Mystery Mile with me. It's our home ground, so to speak.
They'll have to attack us. Either we get them, or they get us.
Any development will be pretty speedy,
certainly sensational and probably final.
What do you say?
You're on.
Should be someone here on guard.
Henry!
  Always did drink.
  It's not drink.
If the coast is clear, I'll give you a signal. Now, wait here.
  Campion...I think I'd better come clean with you.
  Later.
No! Now...
just in case.
After I retired, I worked on a state prison commission. One day, I had to interview a man called Coulson.
He was serving a sentence for dope smuggling. He was a Simister man.
He was dying of cancer. I got him out, so he could spend his last days with his family.
  In gratitude, he gave me a clue to who Simister was.
  What was the clue?
  This little fairytale book.
  I remember old Sinbad...!
  Comfort me with apples.
  I think your dying crook was having you on.
  No.
I've read this little book through 20 times and I cannot find the clue. But I'm sure it's there somewhere.
This isn't the time for a literary discussion. Keep your eyes skinned.
The universal Mr Barber!
It's only me from over the sea!
They've beaten us to it, chums. Barber and Mrs Whybrow both drugged in the house.
  What?
  We're in a trap, like bunnies in a snare.
  Back in the car.
  Hopeless. That's their bright idea, I fancy.
We'll have to try the Lobbett way. George left a boat on the mooring.
  Come on, Albert.
  I'm not coming.
  Come ON!
Look, boy, you cannot do this!
Pull away, Giles. That's an order, or you'll have us all murdered.
It's no good arguing with him.
Kiss me, Hardy! Tell Lugg to lay me out proper and put pennies on my eyes!
"So that all his life, he might have reason to remember the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor.
"In a certain town in Persia, there lived once upon a time two brothers.
"Their names were Kasim and Ali Baba..."
(I've gone mad!)
Good evening, Mr Barber.
Or do you prefer Mr Simister?
  You are alone?
  Judge Lobbett sends his apologies.
  He was called away on business.
  I am not interested in him.
I shall have no difficulty in picking him up whenever I wish.
At this moment, my chief interest is in you.
You are a very clever man, my friend.
Very clever. I have here a most interesting dossier.
I assure you it contains some very remarkable reading.
You and I made the same mistake.
We underestimated each other.
Please, sit down and make yourself comfortable. Try the soapbox.
RUMBLE OF THUNDER I have come to admire you, Mr Campion.
So much so that I now consider it worthwhile to offer you a position in my organisation.
Sign along the dotted line. Please tear carefully. Nothing genuine without this signature.
Always, you like your little joke, Mr Campion.
I suppose I should live in. All found. Washing done by the firm.
And perhaps a Circassian slave too.
You would be well advised to take my offer seriously, young man.
  The alternative is unthinkable.
  No.
No little Albert on the staff.
Foolish!
I must say, you've got some cheek.
I mean, chucking your weight about in a marsh miles away from home.
Suppose I bang you on the head and go away?
I don't think you'd do that. A body would be very difficult to explain.
Your friends at Scotland Yard would not like it.
I'd very much like to know, as one of us is going to cop it shortly,
how have you managed to keep so quiet about yourself all this time?
Ah! I am glad this opportunity has occurred.
The desire to confide is very strong in a man of my temperament.
I have never before found myself in a position where it was quite safe to indulge in that desire.
I am the only man in the world
who has ever turned my business into something as pleasurable
as other more legitimate concerns.
I go where I like, live as I choose, I have friends in high places. I am universally respected.
If I made my money out of oil or cars, it would be exactly the same.
  You buy brains on one side and executive power on the other.
  Yes!
It is a pity I should have to kill you, my friend. You are intelligent.
Ah...
The secret of my success is simple.
My father was the original Simister.
  Good Lord! You inherited it?
  Why not?
As I have been remarkably frank with you, Mr Campion,
perhaps, before we part, you could be frank with me.
How did you stumble upon my true identity?
The clue was in a children's book, completely harmless in itself
and unintelligible to anyone who did not already suspect you. The book is in my pocket.
  May I have it?
  No.
  Please.
I'm inclined to dot you one. I'm younger than you are and more gifted at biffing.
But you are not so well armed. Let me explain.
I read in your dossier that you sometimes carry a water pistol.
I confess I was amused when I read that. So amused
that I thought I too would have my little joke.
My pistol contains a particularly corrosive fluid.
So, you planned this little conversazione?
Most carefully.
Page one, I think.
Ah...I had forgotten.
  Do you always do your murders like this?
  Me?
Oh, never before! It was only because Judge Lobbett was foolish enough to write for an art expert
that I decided to act personally. I am enjoying myself immensely.
Such a delightful conversazione...
What a pity it should have to close.
Don't think me crude, but... the body question is still a worry.
Your body? Not to me. My people have drugged the servants.
I shall return to where you found me. Drug myself properly this time.
Your friends will find the amiable Mr Barber,
the art expert. My alibi will be perfect.
And I shall have a beautiful Romney as a memento of my visit!
  Will you have my epitaph put on my gravestone?
  If it's short!
Oh, yes, no text. Just this, neatly inscribed  
"Here lie I, poor Albert Campion,
"death was bad,
"but life...
"was CHAMPION!"
Here is your epitaph for you!
Campion!
Help me!
Campion! Hurry!
Hurry! I'll give you anything you want! Campion!
Campion! Agh...!
That's the only mystery left. Why did that dear old man take his own life?
  Perhaps we shall never know.
  I can tell you why.
I'm sure he wouldn't mind you knowing, now it's all over.
  Swithin wasn't a parson at all.
  Someone's been pulling your leg.
Swithin had an older brother who was much alike. Both orphans and poor.
Swithin's brother became a priest, but there wasn't enough money left for Swithin to take the degree.
One summer, they were rock climbing in Austria. There was an accident
and the brother was killed. In spite of the grief, he swapped roles.
The right man was buried under the wrong name
and Swithin took the curacy.
  A 50 year old impersonation story.
  Last year, he wrote to me and told me all about it.
I suppose he wanted to confess to someone in writing.
  Unfortunately, that nasty man who kept the Post Office, er...
  Kettle.
..he must have read the letter and passed on the glad news to the gang.
Blackmail, of course. They tried to make him work for them, but he wasn't having any.
As perfect a parson as ever lived and a damned old fraud as well. God bless him.
Lugg, suppose I retire? This profession of mine puts people off.
  You've had a relapse. Better get you home.
  No, I'm serious.
  That's unhealthy in itself.
Look, if you must have a woman about the place,
find a nice, homely hospital nurse. Someone who'll do the washing up.
But we don't want that, do we? Wouldn't be the article, would it?
Push away, Lugg, or we'll miss our piece of wedding cake.
