I know it's cold outside,
but I have never seen a washing line in a bedroom before.
Oh, hello, I'm Patrick.
I'm trying to work out why the washing is hanging up
inside the CBeebies bedroom.
It is a bit cold outside,
but even in cold places they hang their washing outside.
In fact, I know a story about a little girl
who has an adventure after she hangs out the washing.
and it's called, Miki And The Moon Blossom.
Long ago and far away in a land of ice and snow,
there lived a little girl called Miki.
One morning, she and her friends, Polar Bear and Penguin,
were hanging out the washing.
"There," said Miki, "I wish there was a breeze to make it all dry."
Just then, the wind started to blow.
Everything whirled into the air,
and Polar Bear grabbed at a strange spiky thing as it flew past.
"Just what we need to hold up the washing," he said,
sticking it in the ground.
That night, while Miki was fast asleep,
something very strange was happening.
The spiky thing began to grow. It was a seed.
As Miki slept on, it grew and grew.
Little tendrils curled round her house
and gently lifted it into the air.
In the morning, Polar Bear and Penguin were amazed.
Miki's house had disappeared, and she was nowhere to be seen.
"Where are you?" they cried.
Way up in the air, far above them, a tiny voice answered.
"I'm up here."
"We're coming," said Polar Bear.
He and Penguin scrambled onto the enormous plant and started to climb.
Up and up and up!
"Oh, I'm scared of heights," squeaked Penguin.
"Get on my back," offered Polar Bear.
Way above them, Miki ran out onto the stem of the gigantic plant.
The air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers.
"Which way is down?" said Miki aloud.
She had the strangest feeling that someone was watching her.
Sure enough, little faces were peeping out
from one of the huge flowers.
"I wish you'd help me find my friends," said Miki.
Just then, a little breeze ruffled the gorgeous blossoms.
The wind was blowing harder
as Polar Bear and Penguin reached Miki's little house.
"Miki!", cried Polar Bear looking inside, "Where are you?"
Penguin had spotted Miki riding on the back of a strange creature.
"There she is," he cried. "Give her back at once!"
The creature flew away over the clouds,
and Penguin and Polar Bear ran after it.
As they reached the top of the flower,
they saw a sailing ship dipping and rolling in the gusting wind.
Miki was running towards them.
"I'm so happy to find you," she cried.
"These creatures are our friends.
"There's a terrible storm coming and they're helping us escape. Hurry!"
The three friends scrambled aboard the ship just in time.
A tremendous blast of wind shook them into the stormy sky
The air was full of flying flowers and seeds.
By sunset, the wind was quieter,
and the ship sailed more calmly through the sky.
"We'd better be going back home," said Miki.
"But how?" grumbled Penguin.
The ship gave a little shiver.
Miki, Penguin and Polar Bear held hands and jumped out into the snow.
The huge plant was now nothing but a broken stalk.
Above them, the ship was disappearing into the clouds.
Miki cried out, "I'll miss you. I wish we could see you again."
A little breeze whispered over the icy land.
"Look!" cried Penguin.
Miki and Polar Bear stared into the distance.
There, in the moonlight,
were hundreds of plants uncurling their lovely leaves in the snow.
Miki's icy world had never looked so beautiful.
That story was called Miki And The Moon Blossom.
Well, I hope you have beautiful dreams tonight.
I'll see you soon for another story.
Good night.
Now, let me see if this washing is dry!
