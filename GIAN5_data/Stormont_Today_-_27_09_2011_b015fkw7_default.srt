Hello and welcome to Stormont Today where it has been a day of rock 'n'
roll in the chamber and at the centre of it, Jim Allister.
take your seat and since then. Order, order, order! I know the
member is trying almost to be a martyr here.
And from one "rude boy" to that rude girl Rihanna. Why the
superstar's frolics in the field have some MLAs going a bit
disturbia. And taking a bow, our guest of the
day is Seamus McAleavey of NICVA. One year ago Stormont Today was
launched and our first guest was a man who heads up an umbrella body
for many of the voluntary and non  profit making groups that keeps
society ticking over. Seamus McAleavey from NICVA. Thanks for
coming in. We talked about how much the cuts would bite, where are we
12 months on? Weir into the first cheer and certainly there have been
cuts across programmes. We're still at the start of the cuts and I
think a lot more has to happen. The finance minister said it would
amount to �4 billion over the period so, a slice comes out the
first year, more the second and third so it will get tougher as we
go on. He said the cuts could be good for us as it could make
everything leaner and work more efficiently, but what do you
organisations feed back to you on that? I said it would force us to
do things, to lookout change. No one volunteers for that level of
cuts. Certainly, our organisations we have been discussing smart
solutions. We're looking at innovation and change. We're
focusing on prevention rather than cure. Pure tends to be very
expensive. If we can intervene at an earlier stage, be prevented, we
can save the public purse quite a lot of money. Sometimes you think
of the voluntary sector and think that a lot of people are not paid
but you employ 29,000 people. our organisations have always
employed people   in fact for hundreds of years. In terms of
29,000 people, they are employed but 85,000 our volunteers and their
delivering significant social services. You are looking at
organisations like Women's Aid, who intervened in terms of domestic
violence. They are homeless organisations. You have a very wide
range of organisations. Lots of work that is done in the community
in terms of mental health is carried out by voluntary
organisations so voluntary means they're not statutory, the use a
mix of volunteers and paid staff. Stay with us.
Did you know that if you want to become a vet then you have to go
either across the water or down south to achieve your ambition. And
if you fancy improving your spoken Chinese, that is apparently not a
cultural issue. So here are the highlights from questions today,
starting with the agricultural minister on forests. Of at the last
fears the Forestry Commission has failed to deliver a 54 % of its
target for new woodland creation, can the Minister detail how she
means to make up the shortfall. We compare poorly with the EU average
of 34 %. I think have address that in the last question. I am also
disappointed with the targets, we have to keep them under review. I
have said by the end the year I want a full review. We will look at
what we have done and where we expect to be. We have to schemes.
We're also looking as a woodland infantry to establish what we have
infantry to establish what we have exactly. I do not disagree, I am
disappointed with the target. If we can move forward and do what we can
in terms of grand supports and grant aid for farmers who want to
diversify. From tree surgery to animals surgery and Conor Murphy
wants to know it student vets will lose out under the new tuition
arrangements. A my department have an ongoing need for trained
veterinary professionals. I met recently with representations from
the Northern Ireland and British Veterinary Association and listened
to their suggestions about students who want to study veterinary
medicine. I have a personal sympathy with the challenges that
future students will face. I acknowledge there are no veterinary
medicine courses available locally. They are available at Dublin and
across Britain. We will be offering bursaries to students with a law of
back end fees. Students from the north will also be subject to means
tests to help them. Those who wish to study in Dublin, I understand no
tuition fees are chargeable though there is a registration fee which
is reimbursed. I have already relate concerns expressed to me by
the professional veterinary bodies and I intend to meet with them to
seek assurance that the issue will be kept under review. I have
reviewed the supplier of veterinary professionals locally and dance   
and unsure there is no rest. Here is the culture minister responding
to David McLarty about a Chinese. thank the Member for his question.
The primary responsibility for this department relates to their it
North indigenous languages. I recognise the resort    the work of
the Confucius Institute. However, my department has no remit in
respect of the promotion of the Chinese language. Thank you. I
thank the Minister for her response but considering the importance of
the Chinese language as an essential global and business skill,
will the Minister encouraged the Chinese language as a priority
language, to be taught in our schools and colleges? That includes,
understanding the language and the culture. I thank the Member for his
response but I cannot impose anything either on the Department
of Education or the Department of Public learning. There is a
misconception that... I recognise the work of the institutes in
Coleraine, and also I know that in other departments there are other
measures put in for diversity, all I can do is take on board what he
is said but I cannot give a commitment regarding the Chinese
language. Which she consider using the opportunities from the
Institute to have artistic and cultural exchanges with China.
Teaching English is not the all only    teaching Chinese is not the
only purpose of the Institute. appreciate that. I received a
meeting and presentation from several bodies and they have raised
this in terms of celebrating our diversities of all cultures and I
think this is an opportunity to learn lessons from people who have
done that so well. The world police gains due to be held in Belfast and
2013 will be one of her biggest sporting events, but are we ready?
There were over 90 events in New York this year. Are you confident  
  they do a do the beach volleyball and feels apparently. Are you
confident we have they it they sat    the facilities to deliver these
sports, bearing in mind that each country who horse these games
attempts to improve on facilities, can she guarantee Northern Ireland
will have state of the art facilities for these games?
decision on which facilities we are using will be made hopefully in the
autumn. In terms of the finalised then used. In terms of autumn they
year and then looking to see what we can do and we can broaden that
out. Not every team in every country competed in every
discipline. Qasim Minister if she is aware of concerns of
stakeholders in regard to the delivery of the 2013 games?    can
ask the Minister. Has she confidence in the body delivering
for the Games, given that it is crucial for the success of these
games? Remember is right and it is crucial and I am not aware any
concerns in relation to the game's board. And happy to speak to the
member and for her to share her concerns with me. I have confidence
in the chief executives are thus far but I would welcome any member
with any concerns to bring it to my attention.
With almost 30,000 people employed in the voluntary and community
sector here MLAs today called on the Social Development Minister to
improve the working relationship between these groups and government
departments. The Ulster Unionist motion, also called for better
funding for the 4,500 organisations that make up the sector. The SDLP's
Alban Maginness said individual members had an important role to
play as well. It is not sufficient for us therefore to see get on with
it and we will support shoot. There has to be a much closer
relationship between government and the voluntary sector in terms of
building a serious partnership. Which embraces the good work of
that sector. And the work that government requires to be done
within the community because there are certain things the government
cannot do in the community which the community and voluntary sector
can do much better than government. That is the importance of the
voluntary sector. This debate should not just focus on grant
funding alone because many individuals and the community have
long recognised the need for sustainability mainly through the
social economy writ. This is about safeguarding their future when it
inevitably funding work runs out. Will work in partnership with the
sector in delivering social and economic and cultural improvement
in Northern Ireland. To support this over �60 million is being
spent each year in our Supporting People programme. Additional
capital and revenue funding has been secured for the next year
totaling �128 million to take forward schemes for people with
mental health problems. As lead department for relations with the
community    voluntary community sector I am committed to supporting
the most vulnerable and improving the quality of lives and ensuing
access to services. I love like to use this opportunity when we have
the Minister present to respectfully urge he finds a quick
resolution to the public benefit dispute within the Northern Ireland
Charities Act. It is an issue which has been dragging on for a long
time. There are organisations and the voluntary sector unsure of what
their new current legal obligations might be. A lot of that talk about
corporation will be music to your ears but what is the reality?
Things have been going very well. I was very pleased with the debate
today. The Minister said he was proud to be the Minister for work
government and voluntary sector relations. That is important. There
was a broad range of MPs from a range of MLAs from right across
Northern Ireland. We had been working at    women working with
government to improve relations and make things better and make sure we
collaborate better. And pleasing even tight financial situations
that the Northern Ireland Executive have responded to voluntary and
community organisations. They listen and hear what we have to say
so we're pleased with how the relationship is developing with
this Executive and best Assembly.     and this Assembly.
He has been the scourge of the Speaker and his deputy since
arriving at Stormont in May   but today Jim Allister overstepped the
mark, stretching Willie Hay's patience beyond breaking point.
I was tempted to ask the First Minister if it was something he
said or did in the United States which caused the Deputy Prime
Minister to look for other employment. I really Moss say the
member does push the barriers. I have said in this House for some
time, questions sometimes grow legs. It is obvious this morning that is
what the member intense. Then I would ask the member to take his
seat and I will move on. The members need to lose    learned a
lesson in this House that there are protocols that relate to him, as to
any other member. Order! I will now say to the member directly, the
member will not be called in this House for some time in any debate
in this House. Order! Remember now will not be called. Order expires
this House... Take your seat and sit down. This House is a disgrace
to democracy. Order. I know what the member is trying to do. He is
trying to be a martyr here. The members should take a seat and be
quiet. We are now going to move on. We now move on up to his statement
from the Minister of Health Social Services. Mr Speaker, I would like
you to look at the remarks made by the Member for North Antrim who
squeaked in on the eighth or ninth count without reaching the quarter.
He did indicate, he claimed to you were doing your master's fading and
that you peerage was safe. Those contemptuous remarks do need a
response, and I would ask you to look at them. Well, if the Speaker
was not going to call him, Jim Allister decided to get his voice
heard by asking another member to give way. This is common practice
where the member on their feet will pause to let another member make a
point. This is what happened when any to gave away. With the member
agree there was a    something missing in this draft. As stated by
the Speaker earlier on, the member was not to be heard. Other members
should remember that when they are giving way. Order, member resume
his seat. Will remember was in his seat? I spoke to Jim Allister
outside the chamber and he said he thought the Speaker had over 
reacted. There are people who talk about, we needed oppositions. If
this House cannot tolerate one opposition voice, how is it ever
going to cope with an opposition? It really does need to get over
itself and bring itself foreword where democratic debate is
permitted and you do not restrict the calling of speakers to those in
the Executive parties. What sort of Assembly is that? Were you pushing
the boundaries? I do not believe I was pushing the boundaries at all.
I had a legitimate question and they introduced it with what I
thought was humorous. The Speaker jumped on me from a great height
and ordered me to say nothing more. It was a preposterous performance
and they think an over reaction that says more about him and this
House than anything else. Is there bad feeling between yourself and
the Speaker? I went to see him last week after you rule that I was
refused the right to speak in the programme for government debate. I
had what I thought was a civil and forthright discussion with him. His
bad tempered ruling this morning on that very issue surprise me because
you never dealt with the point of Standing Order 17 it will five that
speakers should be called to reflect a balance of opinion. How
can you have a balance of opinion if you refuse to call someone from
outside the Executive parties? I expect a fair crack of the whip and
I do not believe the Speaker gave me that last week or this week.
long is the gagging order in place? The Speaker is like an absolute
monarch in these premises. It is a gagging order at her Majesty's
pleasure, but it has been defined to meet in a letter as being
applicable for one week. Will you be staying away? Tempting as it
would be, I suspect I will be here. It will give me more time to think
up relevant and pertinent questions to ask and discomfort those who
need it. What this place needs is a vibrant, thinking opposition.
Certainly lots of vibrancy in the chamber today's. Seamus McAleavey,
what do you think of the general behaviour of our MLAs? It is pretty
good. Dissent is no bad things. Their behaviour is not so bad and
the Northern Ireland Assembly. The key thing that the public will want
is unity in terms of decision  making. That people begin to make
decisions that really impact on their lives. She may be one of the
world's biggest pop stars but that cuts no ice with the DUP councillor
in North Down. Alan Graham asked to to stop filming her latest video on
his land when she removed some of her clothes. The star is not noted
for being shy about her body, but she did as she was asked and
covered up. R MLAs were not going to miss the opportunity to miss   
to raise the it issued this morning. I am keen to see the creative
industry boosted, and looking forward to the arrival of the MTV
Music Awards I wonder if the First Minister had an opportunity to
assess the damage after the news that the pop icon Rihanna was
foiled in her singing ambitions yesterday, which I believe were no
more sinister than appearing in Bayfield are dressed in red white
and blue. I am pretty sure there was no problem with the colours
involved. I am sure I can also take it that the member has a field on
his estate, so if she needs an alternative location you would be
happy to offer it. Good to see there is still a sense of humour
there. Sinn Fein's Barry McElduff is no
stranger to twitter, but he has to go to the car park to send his
tweeds. It is because of lack of broadband in his area. It is not a
laughing matter for a lot of people in your constituency. In rural
parts of the north, County Tyrone in particular. Areas like Green
Castle, for example. Hundreds of people, hundreds of farmers,
hundreds of families and businesses operate without proper speed
broadband. Indeed, sometimes no broadband at all. This is in a
community where the local college is about to undertake a virtual
learning week and the students from a good part of made to Rome cannot
take part. Farmers are being expected to process applications
online and businesses are asked to make VAT returns online and they
cannot do it. The Minister is critical of you at points in the
debate and says you should not be criticising BT in particular.
holding the Minister, and the Department of Enterprise trade and
investment into account. The bit that seemed to rattle her most, and
she was very cross with the this evening, was when I highlighted
that we do not have 100% broadband access in this region. That is a
favour boast of the Department of Enterprise trade and investment.
But say that to the 200 people who showed up in June at a public
meeting in Green Castle Hall to discuss their problems in one rural
part of Truro. Havel the community showed up. Arlene was cross with me
because she said the meeting was lively. Of course it was lively. In
parts of County Tyrone, the same people who fought a campaign in the
1950s to bring electric, their children are now fighting a
campaign to bring broadband. said you have to look at other
options like Wireless. It is not economic to viable to have everyone
on fixed broadband access. should know better, coming from a
rural community in County Fermanagh herself. There are a number of ways
to achieve broadband, and none of them are working. All I am asking
Arlene Foster to do is to listen to the people and do not be so
defensive about this. Her officials came to the meeting in Green Castle
and said to me at the start, what time is it over? Departments need
to be better at listening to rural communities, and in this case it is
real, broadband has not been achieved in parts of County Tyrone.
People in South Down have been contacting my colleagues about this
issue as well. And in other parts of the North. It is a bigger issue
than Arlene Foster is giving credit to. We have finally got an
announcement on airport duty today. I caught up with a political
Correspondent who told me she is expecting progress on some other
issues which had been on the First Minister's desk for a while.
first and Deputy First Minister have had there long care site on
the desk for some time. They have reached agreement on a development
corporation and we know there has been a number of applications made
to the Office for chairman and six board members. I am told there has
been a lot of interest in those jobs. The corporation is there to
develop the site's historical and economic full potential. There is a
lot of hope that the EU funding, some �20 million to allow the
conflict Transformation Centre to be built. Some other fields have
been causing controversy today. international pop star Rihanna has
been filming a pop video in a field belonging to the DUP farmer near
Bangor. Alan Graham was happy for her Rihanna to film her a video
there until he came past her in his tractor and found she was not
dressed appropriately. He asked her to cover up, and Rihanna took it
well and they shook hands. But it has caused a huge stir in the
minutes    in the media. I asked Peter Robinson if he was concerned
that he has been going off to America to lure people to come here
to film their movies. He laughed it off. Speaking of international
visitors, you have some at news. was surfing the Assembly website
and I find they have a Martians guide to the Northern Ireland
Assembly. And a comic book on how the Assembly works. It turns out
school children get a better understanding of how Stormont works.
The Martians learn there are 108 earthlings here who make decisions
on our behalf. The Martians also find out how difficult it is to be
Speaker here. The final word from you, Seamus McAleavey, �80 million
up for grabs, good news for you sector. Obviously they have
announced a consultation today, 20 million a year, split between
revenue and capital monies. It will be focused on the most
disadvantaged areas. The key thing is how the delivery of the
programme relates to a bigger public services in health and
education. Do you want to see it go to the bigger sectors rather than
innovated projects locally, but I want to see them link back into the
