By now many of us will have started a January detox, but can you
imagine going the whole of December without a single alcoholic drink?
Imagine the office Christmas party, Christmas Day or New Year's Eve,
enjoys a drink decided to do and here is how he got on. Now I work
the time I take to the stage. Frankly, that is half the battle,
if you want to make them laugh. I like to join in with a few glasses
myself. It is rude not to! I was a brewery manager in a former life
and these days I live next door to a pub. So you can see alcohol does
feature fairly prominently in my life. But like many of you, if you
are honest, I reckon I have been pretty blase about the harm it
might be doing to me. And so many others. 20% of people who drink
have a problem. That problem is liver failure and death. One in
five people who drink. They can end up dying because of liver disease.
You don't know what is going to happen next. People like me and my
colleagues at the hospital and paramedics here and they will be
picking up the mess. BBC Radio Sheffield. I have been issued a
challenge. I. Not going to drink through December. The pub. It will
sell out crowd. The booze is already flowing. The night starts
with the same ritual. Vicky, my box office manager loads up the fridge
for tonight's acts. When I heard he was going to have a challenge to
stop drinking, for December, considering how much shows we have
got, I think that will be one heck of a challenge for him. Can he do
it? I would like to say yes. And I am behind him to quit, but I don't
think he will. I've been working. She said were you drinking, I said
no, working. What is his usual tipple? Red wine. How many does he
drink? On a typical night, probably a bottle. Maybe? Possibly more.
you have a drink. I went no, I was at work. He went fair enough. The
most I have drunk on one of these nights is too much. I am relatively
professional. I don't get so I can't talk. A whistle there. Come
buy. They are having a drink. I'm having a drink. Probably three
bottles of wine was my worse. Which is ridiculous. Are you ready to see
the second act? The last act is on stage and that is my last drink at
the comedy club for a month now, until 2000 126789 everybody I have
spoken to said I won't do it. And I think I will. I'm 43 next. My dad
died at 52. I have got two kids. I don't want do that to them. So I am
going to use this as an opportunity to get a handle on it. But I must
say every time I have decided I won't drink I've failed. This is
the bit I don't like. I is have come to Barnsley hospital to
undergo some test, to see if drinking has damaged my body. Over
one million hospital admissions every year are due to excessive
alcohol. Costing the NHS more than ï¿½2.7 billion. The last time I saw
one of these I was going to be a dad.. We are looking for
abnormalitys in the liver. The various tubes that are plumbed in,
the blood vessels. So I have been poked, prodded and bled. Now the
time to get the results. Which if I am honest I am nervous about. First
it seems a bit more prodding is needed. People can have liver
problem, and feel nothing until it is quite late. If you could feel
something there I would be in trouble. Yes, so it is really good
news that blood tests is fine. The ultrasound scan is fine. The
examination is fine. No signs of: nick liver disease, but, you
probably in the medium risk group and you have to just make sure when
you drink, and how you drink. is a relief! Best have a drink to
celebrate! Tonight I am joining Inside Out presenters from all over
who are doing the same as me. And just to encourage us in our attempt
at dry December they have arranged shock tactics. Would you like to
see how you are going to look in ten years time. I wouldn't. If you
carry on drinking as much as you do. That is jab bah the Hut. That is
not me. This is my last drink of the year. In November. Not everyone
it seems has faith in my staying power. Ever since I have known him
he has had a drink. I think he will have trouble sleeping, and take it
out on the rest of the family. have been up since six clock. I
have written the proposal for next year's comedy festival in Sheffield.
Sent confirmation off for the comedians this week and now here we
are in the rain. Ready for a drink. He has been very good. He is
getting through it really well. He gets a bit bored and restless but
that is general Toby, without a drink. When people come to me and
ask me how I'm going on, they are not asking about me, they are
asking about themselves, you can see the fear in their lives. People
think it is strange I have stopped drinking and they think they
couldn't do it. But it is odd. I'm one week in, still sober. But
tonight will be my centreest test of resolve so far. It's the 16th
December and 450 people are in here to watch the ukulele band I'm in.
They will be drinking and I wish I was. Still the lads will support me.
Won't they? What is going on. are drinking beer? Are we not all
in this together? No, we are not! The support band is on stage. I am
stone cold sober and taking serious stick. What is that you are
drinking. Diet coke. That is wrong. He has only siebededed up to not
drink all through December.    decided. What a (BLEEP).
And the way you like to kiss Experts have predicted as many as
250,000 of people will die from alcohol abuse over the next 20
years unless the Government takes the problem as seriously as it kid
smoking. Now that is a sobering thought. It is the night before
Christmas Eve in Barnsley. The town where this happened. This lass was
so drunk she fell under the train she had just staggered off.
Thankfully she was OK. And the town's braced for another bout of
binge drinking. On hand at the tax payers' expense San impressives for
of emergency worker, waiting to pick up the pieces. Dr Julian
Humphrey will be stationed here in a parked ambulance in the town
centre. They call it the drunk tab tank. You don't know what is going
to happen next. We would rather have a nice quiet night. The
reality is that will not be the case. The main purpose is to divert
people away from the emergency department up at the hospital. When
patients go up there they tend to take their friends wo have a few
drinks and you can have confrontations. Through no fault of
their own, having an accident or being a by stander in a fight that
goes off in a club. Right on cue his first casualty is a victim of
an unprovoked attack. It hurts. It winds me up, it is why does
everybody, even when you are drinking you know not to start
trouble. It has not been Christmas, it has been rubbish. It is
Christmas Day lunch. There is my wife's drink. There is my drink.
Nothing. Any way. Cheers. So hello and happy New Year. Happy New Year.
It is the first January 2012 and I had a drink last night. And it was
OK, I have a sore head this morning, I don't know really. I didn't miss
it too much. The last week, between Christmas and New Year I have
missed it more than ever. But the first three weeks were a breeze.
What? So I'm going to stop drinking now. I think it may be I pack it in
for a bit. See how much I get done. So thank you very much indeed. Bye.
Coming up. Making a come back. We go in search of elusive otter
13 year old Rosie came from Wakefield has Asperger's syndrome.
She has a brother and sister her post disabled. We asked her to
explain to us what it was like growing up in a family that is a
little bit different. I am rosy. I am 13 years old. I
have a brother and sister. Daisy is 10. Lenny is a nine. I have a
lovely money. She is called Sharon. I have a dad who is equally as good.
We have a loss of the artistic spectrum in our life. I have
Asperger's. And by brother and sister are also disabled. What do
you think of that one? You can think of what it is in your mind,
but it is almost impossible to put down in words. You would have to
see through the eyes of an autistic child to know exactly what cities.
I can see that, but it is hard to put into words. We are looking at
busy's uniform so that she can go to high school in 10 days' time.
While our own, everything is great. It is when we are right, you have
to be 100% alert to what they're doing. They are not aware of any
dangers. I'm just making sure they're not doing anything they
should not be doing. I can get so stressed sometimes. I get these
little tics. I sometimes scream for no reason at all or just want to
run. I would just changed from extremely happy to extremely sad.
People would just think I'm being like this on purpose and they would
laugh. They would make fun of me. For someone like Rosie, who is
bright and academic, it is also important for people to sometimes
make allowances for her. Her socialisation does not come as
naturally as other people's. She has had to learn things like how
far to stand away from someone when you are talking to them. She has
had to learn to maintain eye contact when people are talking to
her. These things can be mistaken as rudeness or naughtiness. Daisy
is a lot different. She has kabuki syndrome and not autism. That
mixture quite small for her age and her brain his way back in a two
year old's. In many ways, she is a two year old in a 10 year old's
body. Daisy has some physical differences as well. Generally,
strangers will see her and will know that she has a learning
disability. With Lenny, it is a different matter. His features are
regular. He looks like any other boy. But he might be acting
differently. When I was eight years old, I got diagnosed with
Asperger's syndrome. Now I am going to meet someone who got diagnosed
when he was 40. He got a book called the Little Rain man, of
which taught adults about autism. I read the book to understand more
about Lenny. I find a lot of symptoms in their that just
described to me and I told mum. I went to a diagnosis and then it
turned out I had Asperger's syndrome. How are you dealing with
it at school? It is OK. I used to get bullied at school when I was
your age. Basically, people did not understand me, they did not
understand what was going on with me. I did not like school. I did
not have many friends at school. I find it hard to get on. I felt as
though I did not belong on this earth, because you just feel like
you think differently and you look at things differently. Basically, I
found it hard. Are you working? have worked at four places and 22
years. It was hard work. People did not understanding. I would get on
with the job and then somebody would hide my brush when I was
speaking    sweeping up. My brother sometimes messes up my room and
that annoys me. Alike my room very neat. But I do not really let my
mum tidy my room because she puts things in the wrong places.    I
like my room. I had a really nice experience meeting Tony. He is one
of the best people I have ever met. He should be given a really massive
award for being Tony. I have learnt a lot of strategies and a lot of
very good things from meeting him. For Asperger's and autism in
particular, at the more people understand about the traits, at the
more unlikely people hour to get a diagnosis. Once the shame is taken
away, I also think people are much more likely to see    seek counter
diagnoses so they can get the help and advice they need. A lot of
people have learned from dizzy, a lot of people in mainstream schools.
   daisies. She cannot go to my school because there is so much
moving around and she has difficulty walking. We are taking
her to Cockfield Park and she will enjoy it there, hopefully.   
Cockfield Park. This is his school for children with severe and
complex learning disabilities. They stay from 11 19. One third of them
have a diagnosis of autism. I said good morning to everybody here and
now we're going to saying hello to everybody in our new class one.
Hallow, Dizzy!    how low, Daisy! It filled me with excitement for
her. The school is geared towards independence and branching out. I
think she will be very happy. has enjoyed being in class,
exploring the school, being outside at playtime. You can tell she is a
bit tired. Every family has the challenges. Our Rosie is happy and
outgoing. For most Asperger's people, their social skills are a
problem. With her, her social skills a fantastic! And the fact
that we're all disabled, and that could make it any buddy's life
really difficult. We are very happy family. A lot of families like us,
they have difficult lives. But we just get on with it and our lives
In recent years, and Occupy Wall Street have made an astonishing
comeback after their numbers were almost wiped out in the 1970s and
1980s.    otters have made a comeback. We tried to film a family
of Potter's and we knew it would not be easy.    a family of otters.
Hidden away in the corner of East Yorkshire is an unlikely nature
reserve. It is a place where modern industrial man comes face to face
with a spectacular array of wildlife. This little known site on
the River Hall is part nature reserve and part water treatment
works. The 300 acre facility has a mix of woodland, marshes and
lagoons that are surrounded on all sides by intensely farmed land.
This place supplies about 85% of our drinking water. But it also
plays host to a vast array of wildlife. It is best known for its
birds, with over 160 species regularly seen each year. But there
are plenty of other animals hiding away. One of the most prized assets
is a family of extremely camera shy otters. We're going to try and fill
done. These daylight pictures of offers were filmed in Somerset and
a rare because the animals are mostly nocturnal and wary of humans.
Otter numbers are now back any increase after reaching an all time
low in the 1970s due to pollution and the loss of habitat. With only
one family living at the top of this river, they will be hard to
find. Luckily, the site Ranger is something of an expert. Haiti you
know that otters are using this area?    How do you know? They will
always use the same routes. This trail is one of them. They're
making a very regular report. They have virtually wore no it out.   
warned it out.    warned it out. This is offer faeces. It is quite
brittle but filled with tiny little fish bones. This is a giveaway that
they have been using this area? This is proof positive. To try and
encourage otters to settle in the nature reserve, they are being
given a helping hand. Houses are being dug into suitable sites.
Otters like to nest in underground chambers. They like easy access to
water. It is quite a quiet area where nobody normally walks. It is
a nice quiet spot. It might need to go one diagonally. And we will
shifted round a bid to match that all up there.    shift it round a
bit. It could take two years until they get used to it. They're not
going to be too sure about a new feature. They could view it as a
trap. For an offer that finds this, it is a pretty good home, isn't it?
It is, yes. So the best thing we can do is just leave it be? Yes.
and down to business. Our aim is to try and get these otters on camera.
How do you propose we film These Animal Mike? One option is to film
at the old fashioned way with night vision gear. The other option is to
use camera traps which take a picture every time the subject used
   moves past it. Fingers crossed, it will be quite tricky. It will
pick anything up to a 10 metre range. Hopefully, anything that
does go past, we should have a reasonable chance of getting it. So,
all we have to do is wait for the dark and hope for some otters.
we start to use the light, or are we have the use of these night 
vision binoculars. We can use these to get a view after the hours of
darkness. It could be about 10:30pm. The light has pretty much gone. We
are switching to infra red cameras. Hopefully we can see things going
past. We scour the marsh area for any signs that otters might be
about. After several hours, nothing. There is nothing tonight,
unfortunately. Let's go and check the camera trap. We pick our way
back through the dark to where we set the camera, but sadly, the only
thing it has captured his us coming to check it. We have not seen
anything tonight, but we will not give up. We're going to be said
that traps and come back at a later date and hopefully pick something
up.    reset the traps. It has been about two months since we were last
here. In that time, there have been some reported sightings of offers.
We just have to hope that one of them has been through one of our
camera traps. A loaf. Hello. Good to see you again. We are going to
NT become a track    trap and see what it has picked up in the last
couple of months. Quite a few of our regulars are very keen and have
been very successful with sightings. Fingers crossed. Let's see what we
have got. We load the camera's card on to a computer, and it is just a
question of what it has seen. There's the tale of a pheasant.
There is a our offer! There is another one. Look at that! Probably
one of the cubs, I would think. This is probably one of the
youngsters on film. He is probably about six months old. It is just
one glimpse from two months of filming, but it proves there fear
still on the reserve. The NDC some other footage from when they were
younger.    then we see. Here are three cubs. That is fantastic. To
get if you like that, it does not matter how many hours we need to
put in. Richard has also managed to get some rare footage of otters in
daylight on his video camera. can just see them preaching like a
group of dolphins. It is the same family from the camera trap. That
is fantastic. They are actively hunting the reed bed. I suppose you
have to be prepared night after night after night. Proof positive
that the Offer's exist. If you want to see them, you need to have a lot
