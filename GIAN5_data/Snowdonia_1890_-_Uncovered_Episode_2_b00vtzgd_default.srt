Look, there it is!
  Come on then. Let's go and have a look.
  I can't wait.
  Neither can I.
'We're in Snowdonia,
'heading to a very special place on a very special mission.'
'Here, two brave families have given up the comforts of the modern world
'and are living just as if it were 1890.'
'But our challenge is to find out who really lived here in Victorian times
'and to uncover the evidence that tells us what their lives were like.'
'It's proving to be quite an adventure.'
'Five miles from the town of Caernarfon, high on a mountain moor,
'something very strange is going on.'
'Two families   the Braddocks from Abergavenny and the Joneses from Denbigh,
'have stepped back in time to take part in a new TV series.'
'They've given up their cosy houses, warm clothes and modern gadgets,
'to live in neighbouring cottages, just as if it were 1890.'
Treat them as you treat a man. Firm!
'we've been keeping an eye on them too.'
  We know they died.
  Because there's a "D".
'We've been looking at the evidence   the maps, photos, books and objects,
'that help us understand more about what life in a house like this
'would really have been like back in 1890.'
'And from what we've seen, it looks as though the TV series
'is actually pretty close to the truth.'
But what was life like away from home all those years ago?
  What was school like?
  And work?
  What did they do for fun?
And where can we find the clues that will help us find out more?
'While the families have been out, we've been poking about their houses.'
'But the biggest clue as to what life was really like here in 1890
'wasn't in the loft or on the stove.
'It's a document we've unearthed in the local archive.'
We've found an important piece of evidence here.
This document's known as a census and it dates back to 1891
and tells us who originally lived here in Tal y Braich and what they did for a living.
'The census reveals lots of amazing facts.
'Believe it or not, in 1891,
'there were two families living in Tal y Braich.
'11 people, one tiny cottage.'
'One of those families was the Hugheses,
'and the census shows that both the men of that household
'worked as quarrymen.'
'We know that there were slate quarries very close to Tal y Braich.
'One of them was called Moel Tryfan.
'This is where the 2010 men and boys are working in the TV series.
'It might well have been where those original residents of Tal y Braich worked.'
Just getting to the quarry could be a hard slog in the countryside.
There were no cars or buses, so for most men,
the only way to get there was on foot,
come rain or shine, for miles and miles, over hills and mountains.
And they had to be there on time.
Otherwise, well, they just wouldn't get paid.
The quarry is closed now, but all around you can still see
the evidence of the work that went on here.
'Huge chunks of rock were blastedfrom the mountain, than hauled down,
'split into slates and shipped all over the world.'
'We're on our way to see former quarryman Bobby Jones,
'to look for evidence that shows what life for quarry workers
'would really have been like back in 1890.'
'By the time we get to him, the mountain weather's closing in
'and we're really glad to find some shelter.'
So Bobby, what is this place?
This place is called the cabin, or "caban" in Welsh.
The cabin was a very important place in the quarry for the workmen.
For coming in out of the cold during winter.
You'd get a nice fire
and you'd warm yourself ready to go back afterwards.
'I wouldn't fancy going out again in the freezing cold.'
There's some good stuff in here. You've just got to find it.
Stop complaining. Try and get some decent stuff, will you?
'But the 2010 men and boys have no choice if they want to earn a living.'
'I was wondering though, what evidence is there to show
'what a quarryman's life was really like back in 1890?'
We've got some pictures here. Can you tell me a bit about this one?
That's a picture of a rockman drilling on the rockface.
He's dangling on a piece of rope that's tied at the top,
and he puts it round his leg there to make sure he doesn't fall.
He's drilling a hole in the rock face.
After drilling the hole, he'll put black powder in and blast it.
  There were no harnesses back then, were there?
  No. Nothing.
  He'd be hanging on the rope.
  So what about this one here?
This one is a different one.
He's got a standing platform and he's with a hammer and chisel
splitting the rock that has been blasted.
It doesn't look very stable, does it?
It was a very dangerous job. Very dangerous.
A piece of slate could come and hit this platform down.
So this is obviously very strong evidence
that this was a working quarry back in 1890.
Oh, yes. It was a dangerous occupation, being a rockman.
'All this talk of accidents has made me think there may be more evidence.
'I've come to the Gwynedd Archive in Caernarfon.
'It's full of fascinating old documents.
'Just the place to find out more about quarry life 120 years ago.'
We've been up to the quarry
and seen how cold and tough it must have been back then.
But what evidence is there to show how dangerous it really was?
Plenty. First of all, there was a quarry hospital in many areas.
This here is from the Dinorwig Quarry's Hospital
and it's a record of the in patients.
Those who were injured badly and had to stay in hospital.
Some of the injuries were truly terrible.
They tell us who the people were, where they were from,
when they were admitted, what was wrong with them,
when they left the hospital.
If indeed they did, because some of them died.
  How do we know they died?
  Because there's a "D" in this column here.
It says, result, and "C" means they were cured, and "D" means they died.
And the remarks here tell us what exactly the accident was.
So here, "Piece of slate fell on his head from gallery above."
That often happened, especially after blasting.
There would be rocks loose.
It happened in the winter as well, when the ice got into the crevices.
They were very serious injuries.
I've seen some pictures of how they used to quarry
and this is obvious proof of how dangerous it was.
Here's Ryan Thomas from Llanberis, who fell.
"His face striking the ground."
Another one here. "Jammed between two wagons as they were pushing the slates around the quarry."
Another one here. "Slipped on ice."
So there were all sorts of different dangers there.
And this man died from slipping on ice.
Carys has been looking in the archives and has found stories
about men who died in accidents while working in the quarry.
I wonder if we'll be able to find more evidence in here?
'Mynwent Hermon, Hermon Cemetery,
'lies in the shadow of Moel Tryfan Quarry.
'It's no surprise that almost all the gravestones here are made of slate,
'but I'm looking for one particular stone that tells a very sad story.'
'This is the grave of John Parry, who according to the inscription,
'was killed in a quarrying accident aged just 41.'
It just shows how dangerous life in the quarry was.
'There are graves like John Parry's in cemeteries all over North Wales.
'Testimony to the terrible human cost of the Victorian slate industry.'
'The rewards for doing risky work in the quarry weren't great.'
The account books for the quarry show that men and boys were paid very little.
'A quarryman in 1890 might earn just four shillings a day.
'That's 20 pence.
'After paying household rent and union dues,
'there wouldn't have been much left over.'
'And there was one other thing that cost money   school.
'To make matters worse, it wasn't much fun when you got there.'
Before we proceed,
I want to make sure that you remember all the rules.
You do not speak until you are spoken to.
We must behave ourselves at all times. Do you understand me?
Yes, Sir.
You do not yawn in class, boy!
Sit up straight.
So here we are at the school.
I'm a bit scared now, seeing what that teacher's like.
  Well, you're going in first, mate!
  No, ladies first.
  No, after you.
Come on.
What time do you call this? Come in and stand by your desks.
I said stand!
Now you may sit down.
That was pretty scary but we know you're not as fierce as all that.
But what was school really like back in 1890?
School was pretty difficult, I would imagine for children in the 1890s.
The reason we know that is because a number of things
have survived from the period.
Things like these exercise books.
Most of the information comes from the school records of the period.
Things like school log books,
where the headmaster used to note down what happened in the school.
So I think, girl, that you should be going down to the local archives to look at those.
While you, my boy, must practise your handwriting.
Now then Kyle, I want you to copy this sentence
and fill the whole page.
'I have to say, I don't envy Kyle one little bit.
'While he's hard at work, I've come back to the Gwynedd Archive
'in Caernarvon to see what the old school records reveal.'
Sian, we've seen how tough life was
for the children back in school in 1890.
But is there any more evidence we can look at?
Yes. This log book is from Rhostryfan British School,
which is only a few miles from Tal y Braich.
Perhaps the children from Tal y Braich went to this school.
It was their local school. It wasn't very far away. Who knows?
It suggests there were some fun things going on in school.
They were taught songs, for example.
Here we see that sewing was taught for the first time.
But it gives you an idea as well of the whole society and culture.
We see here that there was a half day holiday
for the National Eisteddfod of Wales, which was held in Caernarfon.
So perhaps many of the people from this area
would have gone to the Eisteddfod that day.
There seems to be a bit of an obsession about the word, "absentee". What was that all about.
Sometimes the children were kept home because they were ill.
There was a lot of illness around.
But sometimes, they were kept home to help
because there was a lot of farming work to be done in these communities.
So I suspect there were several reasons why the children didn't always attend school.
So this gives us a much clearer view of what life was actually like
in the community, not just in school.
'I think Carys had a lucky escape.
'I'm starting to find school 1890s style pretty hard going.'
I may get good handwriting, but it's pretty boring.
  Was school really that boring back in 1890?
  I'm afraid it was.
It was the three Rs. Reading, writing and arithmetic.
Those were the three main things, but pretty boring stuff on the whole, I must admit.
What would happen to children if they misbehaved?
I'm afraid they would get a taste of this.
  How do we know that?
  The punishment books have survived,
in which the headmaster would have to note down the punishment that was given out to each child.
I think Carys had better look at those when she's in the archives.
In here, some old books which I can show you.
These are punishment books.
They come from the end of the 1800s and beginning of the 1900s.
And not just records of punishment, but corporal punishment.
So these are people who are physically caned in most places.
"Caned a few times on the hand." Same again here and there.
This one here, "Beaten a little." We don't know any more than that.
But in most of these cases, that's what happened.
The children were caned, and that could have been very painful.
'I couldn't help wondering what the children had done
'that was so bad that they were beaten.'
The things they did weren't all that bad.
  Look at this girl here.
  Ellen Williams.
March 21st, disobedience, so she was caned on both hands.
Here she is again on April 11th, a few weeks later,
caned several times on the hand for,
"Taking the cap of W.J. Roberts and filling it with gravel."
Not such a terrible thing to do, but she was beaten.
There's one here for just calling after the head teacher
when he was on his bike.
For that, they were caned the next day.
There's one other example here. John Jones.
"Counting with fingers after being told not to yesterday."
For that again, he was caned a few times on the hand.
It must have been very hard.
I think I'd better go back and check on Kyle because I've left him there all alone.
Jack, Jack, Jack. Pick up your blotting paper, please.
Wipe that off the floor. Suck it up, don't just spread it out.
Put the blotting paper down and let it be sucked up into the paper.
If you slouch about, that is what happens. Do not lean on your desk.
  Do you understand?
  Yes, sir.
Ink is not cheap, boy.
'One thing was puzzling me about the school.
'All the lessons and text books seem to be in English.
'But our 1891 Census shows us the children could only speak Welsh.
'How did they cope in class?'
Most children found it well nigh impossible to stop speaking Welsh
and speak nothing but English.
Here we have an important piece of evidence from the period
to show an attempt made to try and prevent the children speaking Welsh.
It would have been worn around the child's neck.
Whoever had it last, at the end of the day,
would have been punished in some form, maybe the cane.
Whoever had it last, how did they get rid of it?
If they heard somebody else speaking Welsh, they could pass it on.
Not only did it make the children ashamed of their own language,
it also taught them to snitch on one another.
We do not speak Welsh in school.
So...
You must wear that to remind you.
'As somebody who was educated in Welsh, it makes me quite upset
'to think of what local children went through at school.'
'But life in 1890 wasn't all bad.
'We've come to the Museum of National History at St Fagans in Cardiff.
'It's just the place to find out what Victorian children did after school
'and they got to have some fun.'
How would we know what kind of games children played with in 1890?
There are lots of ways to find out.
In the museum, we have a big archive full of old books and photographs.
You can see the types of toys that would have been played with.
Things like rocking horses, dolls houses, tricycles.
Was there a difference between the toys the rich and poor children had?
There was a huge difference. Richer children had different toys.
These would have been the types of things they'd have played with
if they had mothers and fathers who had more money
to buy them expensive bikes or dolls.
Compare these to this scooter which was made around 1900.
It's very hand made looking and again here, the see saw.
It was made out of a barrel and a long piece of wood.
'But rich or poor, the Victorians loved their rules.
'This book of advice told children that marbles are fine
'so long as naughty boys don't start throwing them.
'But football is dangerous for the legs and best avoided.'
These are the type of toys children would have been familiar with.
They would have been homemade or made by the blacksmith.
I'm stressing out.
And backwards.
There we are, well done. Well done.
  Perfect.
  Well done.
'There was plenty of fun to be had in 1890.
'Even if the modern children aren't always impressed.'
The games from 1890 are more or less just wood and extra material.
They get a bit boring after a while.
'We've seen what work, school and play were like in 1890.
'But there was another aspect of life that was just an important.'
This old book is a clue, the family Bible.
Over here, the Ten Commandments. I guess they were very religious.
'I know exactly where to look for more evidence.'
All over Wales, we can still find buildings like this   chapels.
They often have their names and the year they were built written on them.
Let's see if I can find any clues inside
about how important religion was for people back then.
The nature of God's light, God's light is greater than the sun
and anything else he has created.
We may know that his light will overcome our inner darkness.
  It's a pleasure to meet you in this amazing, beautiful building.
  And you, my friend.
Are there any clues inside that tell us what chapel was like in 1890?
In 1890, this was a central part of their lives.
There weren't any concert halls in a village like this. It was only the chapel.
Everything happened around the chapel.
Originally, the place was so popular that people had to come early to find a seat.
So, they got over that by deciding to rent a seat to a family.
You had an annual rent to pay the chapel, so to speak.
It's a bit like a season ticket in today's football stadium.
'The numbers on the pews are in the old chapel record book.
'They tell us who rented the pews, and how often they came to chapel.
'Three times on Sundays.
'So what was it they were so keen to hear?
The great preachers became so famous that they were like pop stars.
They weren't just actors who were trying to fake something,
they were people who sincerely believed that it was important
for the people in front of them to hear the word of God.
  The great preachers of their age...
  ..would vary the tone.
So that one minute, I could speak softly,
and I could hold you in that position
of wondering what I'm about to say next.
The next minute I could suddenly RAISE my voice!
So that you are pinned against the back of your seat.
  "Until you hear the word of the Lord strongly..."
That was how dramatic the old preachers were.
'Like pop stars, the best preachers didn't come cheap.
'The records show that some charged over two pounds to preach.
That was two and a half weeks' wages for a quarryman.
What role would music have played in chapels in 1890?
Music was an important part for worship,
but it was also an important part of their cultural life.
Whereas in the church only the choir sing, in a chapel, it was for the whole congregation
to express their love to God and their sense of praise,
by enjoying singing His praises.
'I was wondering, though, how did chapelgoers learn to sing so well
without any musical training?
Here is an interesting piece of evidence
as to how people learned to sing in 1890,
when they couldn't really read music as we know it today.
It was an easy thing to take this piece known as a modulator,
which taught you to go, Doh ray me fah soh lah te doh
I'm sure you've got a better voice than me. Would you like to try it?
I will give it a go.
Doh ray me fah soh lah te doh Doh te lah soh fah me ray doh
Of course, most of the male voice choirs learned to sing this way.
In fact, most of their music, to this day,
is written in soh fah.
'Unlike school, services in chapel were held in Welsh, the congregation's mother tongue.
'Religion was vital in keeping the Welsh language alive
'during times of great change.'
  Nice to see you.
Hello, how are you?
'As well as services, chapels held Sunday Schools.
Special lessons for children and grown ups about religion,
music and even reading and writing.
Once a year, the Sunday School would organise something special.
'The Sunday School outing was a big day.
'One of the few chances people had to get away from the grind
'of daily life.
'But getting away was easier said than done.'
'Sunday School trips were sometimes made by horse and cart.
'But a big change was on its way to the countryside.
'It's got the makings of an ideal day out for the families.'
Back in 1890, this was considered as the modern technology.
It was fast, noisy and a lot of fun.
It was the steam train.
'The coming of the railways transformed large parts of the Welsh countryside.
'Old maps show how the first lines were built to link slate quarries
'to the local sea ports.
'Soon, though, passenger trains were allowing local people
to travel further than they had dreamed possible.
'The countryside was opening up, and would never be the same.'
This trip was probably the furthest some people went from home. They wouldn't have travelled far.
Because you had to walk everywhere,
ten miles would have seemed like a huge amount of distance back then.
A ride on the train would've probably been exciting, and something to save up for as well.
'A lot of old railway lines are gone now
but sometimes you can still see clues as to where they used to be.
Look at this flat ground and this old tunnel.
This is an old abandoned railway line which is now a cycle path.
'There was another piece of technology at this time
'which transported people in a completely different way.'
There was no films and cinemas, and certainly no TV.
But every once in a while, something very exciting would come to town.
The very latest entertainment, the 3D cinema of its day  
the magic lantern.
'Here he is, Bonzo the Wonderdog!'
'The magic lantern used a lamp, lenses and coloured glass slides
'to make the audiences laugh, shudder and gasp with delight.
'We have to shout, "Hup, 'Arold!"
  Up, Harold!
  'Yes!' There he is!
'The moving pictures of the cinema were still four years away.
'So, for an isolated rural community, in 1890,
'this was their only chance to have a glimpse of the world's wonders.
'Finally, the wonderful city of Rome.
'Day into night.
'Thank you and goodnight!'
Having not had any entertainment for three weeks,
something like that was quite nice, like going to the pictures.
So, yeah. It was good. I think the kids enjoyed it as well.
It's a really exciting day, here.
The families are coming out of their houses after living in the 1890s for the past three weeks.
Now it's time for them to rejoin the modern world.
It must have been a fantastic experience.
I wonder how they found it.
I learned a few things about life here.
One of them is, definitely, it's a lot harder.
We're lucky. Back in 1890, you're more or less on your own.
I'm pleased with myself that I can say I lived as an 1890s child.
And I've loved it.
'If there was anyone still alive who lived in 1890,
in this time, I would shake their hand very hard.
Because they have obviously been through
the hardest time ever.
So, Kyle, comparing it to the evidence we've discovered,
do you think the TV series really shows us what life was like
for our great great great grandparents?
I think it does. It's as close as we're going to get to time travel without using a TARDIS.
'And remember, wherever you live in Wales, there's evidence about the past waiting to be discovered.'
'So go and have a look.'
