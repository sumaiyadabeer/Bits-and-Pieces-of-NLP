This is not a fairytale, come and play the game.
If you want to take the Tower, you have to say his name  
it's Wiley, Wiley Sneak!
Whoa!
It's off to the Tower, you'll be up against each other.
Sabotage the game, but do not blow your cover!
I am waiting for you, kiddies!
Because only one will escape and the rest...
You're trapped!
I am the mystical fortune teller   Medazla and I can read your minds!
Ah, not really!
It's me   Caretaker.
I am trying some "predictacating"!
I pinched this from the One Eyed Watcher.
I predict I will be very handsome. Hmm, true!
I predict that Fluffy will bite me. Ow! True.
I predict that these Unfortunates will be nothing but trouble.
Up they come. This winch rope is older than me!
I should have got a new one last century. Ha, ha!
This next batch of Unfortunates are from Eastbourne.
There's Sophie who is an Eskimo.
Aaron   who has a job as a toilet flusher.
Rebecca   she looks like she is regretting that kebab.
Harvey   he collects castles.
Dani, whose boyfriend is a cheese baguette.
And Grahame who is a supermarket security guard.
There's no turning back now!
This is my Watch Tank.
This is where I see everything that goes on in the Tower.
Hundreds of years ago, bobbing craft began arriving.
Each one filled with Unfortunates,
ready to take on the Voice and her Tower.
Imprisoned at the top they work as a team to pass the challenges
and escape each floor.
But...one of them cannot be trusted!
On each floor, a new Saboteur is chosen...
  You are the Saboteur!
..and helps them to ensure their team fail each challenge.
Floor by floor, it's a battle against their friends.
Only one will escape with the Key Of Freedom.
And the rest remain...
Trapped!
Floor Six   Poisoned Harvest.
These berries might look guzzlesome but looks can be deceiving.
Welcome to the mystical wood,
where trees burst with juicy weedleberries.
To pass this challenge,
they must collect berries and put them in each other's baskets.
They must be careful as purple berries are poisonous.
If two baskets are found contaminated with poison berries,
they will fail.
So, who is the one who can't be trusted?
It's time to pick the Saboteur!
'Grahame, do not react.
'You are the Saboteur.
'It is your job to ensure your team fail this challenge.
'You can do this by making sure two baskets contain
'a poison berry at the end of two minutes.
'Be careful! You don't want to be detected.
'Do not panic! I will guide you through your Whisper Clip.'
Grahame is the bad apple this time, can he turn the challenge rotten?
Unfortunates, this is Poison Harvest.
To pass, you must collect all the good weedleberries
without contaminating more than two baskets.
Let the challenge begin, now!
'Grahame, you have to contaminate two baskets.
'Remember, you have time.
'So, wait for the right moment then strike when no one is looking.
'First of all, look like you are helping the team.'
  Stop dropping it!
  'OK, brace yourself!
'When it is safe, sneak a purple berry into your hand.
'That's it!
'Right, whose back is turned?
'Rebecca!
'She didn't see that coming.
'Now blend in with the others, give them some encouragement.'
Come on, hurry up!
'Right, remember you still need to contaminate one more basket.
'You must be careful, no one must see you.
'Quick, I can see it in your hand, get rid of it!
'That was a bit risky!
'60 seconds!
'Two baskets contaminated all you need to do is keep your head down.
'Help your team mates, put some good berries in their baskets.
'Well done!'
Come on, Sophie!
'Talk to them.'
  Quick!
  I am.
'You are a team player, aren't you, Grahame?'
'Is that a purple berry in your hand? What are you doing?
'Why did you contaminate Aaron's basket again?'
I can't see no more.
'Concentrate on picking the red berries!
'I said the red berries, not purple berries.
'You don't need to contaminate any more baskets.
'Grahame, you really are playing a dangerous game.'
There are some over here.
'Time is nearly up, don't take any more risks.'
Sophie, out the way.
  'That's it!'
  Any more?
Your time is up. You have failed miserably!
Looks like the team have failed but has the Saboteur been seen?
You must now vote for who you think the Saboteur was and why.
Sophie, who do you think the Saboteur was and why?
I think it was Grahame
because he kept putting purple berries into our basket.
  Aaron.
  Grahame.
He'd not show us the berries when he put them in,
he looked around to see if anyone was looking when he picked them.
  Rebecca.
  I thought it was Grahame because he smiled.
  Harvey.
  I think it was Grahame cos I saw him picking purple berries.
Dani.
I think it was Grahame because I saw him pick up a purple berry
and put it into someone's basket.
Grahame, who do you think the Saboteur was?
I think it was Harvey
because when I asked everyone to hurry up, he wasn't saying anything.
You have voted for Grahame.
I can now reveal the Saboteur was in fact...
Grahame!
Grahame, although you sabotaged the challenge you were detected
therefore you will be not be leaving this room.
  The others are free to pass to the next floor.
  Ah!
Grahame, why do you think the others voted for you?
Well, because I was that obvious
that they noticed that I was picking the purple berries.
Poor Unfortunate, Grahame.
You're trapped!
Grahame, got a bit carried away there.
The trick to sabotaging is to be all sneaky like.
Floor Five   Septic Sewers.
Urgh! Raw sewage, my favourite smell but not for the Unfortunates,
it gets right up their nose.
Ah, the Septic Sewers.
To pass this challenge, Unfortunates must plug up the toxic gas
escaping from the drain.
It's causing a right old stink.
When the drain is complete they'll be sucked up the pipes.
Someone will be sneaking about.
They must plug up the drain before the time runs out or they will fail.
It's time to pick the Saboteur.
'Aaron, do not react.
'You are the Saboteur.
'It is your job to make sure your team fail this challenge.
'You can do this by making sure the drain is not complete at the end.
'I will advise you when it is safe to leave your pipe
'and unplug the stinky gasses.
'You will have five seconds to unblock the drain.
'When you first touch a plug, I will guide you.'
  I am so excited, I could snart!
Can Aaron do it?
Unfortunates, this is septic sewers.
First, you must complete the drain by the end of two minutes.
Let the challenge begin now!
'OK, Aaron, concentrate on completing the drain.
'It is important that you blend in.'
  I've got it!
  Quick.
'Drain complete.'
'Now, come out. Remember to be quick and quiet.
'Pull out some plugs.
'Get back into the tunnel, quick!
'You must not be seen.
'Go, go, go!
'They are finding this too easy.
'This time pull out even more plugs.
'The coast is clear. Out!
'You are doing really well but you need to pull out more plugs.
'Out, work with your friends.
'Look like you're really helping.'
  Go on, Dani.
  Get it!
'Drain complete.'
'Now, out. This time take as many plugs out as possible.
'That's it, one more, another one, keep going.
'Excellent. Get in!
'Now out, now!'
Oh, no!
Give me that one!
'Drain complete.'
'You need to point the blame at one of the others.
'That's it, go on.
'It looks like someone else could be the Saboteur.
'Come out.'
I cant reach!
'That's confused them.
'Now, out! This time throw the plug out of reach.
'They'll never find that. Hold it.
'Don't be the first one out.'
  Where is it?
  Where did it go?
  'It's working.'
  Where is it?
'Oh, no! Dani found it.
'Time is running out. You have to be quick.
'You must pull out a plug!
'Now get back in, quick!'
Oh, gutted!
Your time is up.
You have failed miserably.
Oh, nicely done.
But has the Saboteur been spotted?
You must vote for who you think the Saboteur was.
Aaron, who do you think the Saboteur was and why?
Harvey because he keeps coming late when all of us were coming out
and they normally ended up on his side.
Rebecca, who do you think the Saboteur was?
I think it was Dani cos all the pieces came out
on her side or in front of her.
Harvey?
Dani, cos I heard a little rolling in the tunnel next to me.
Dani?
I think Harvey because I heard something from the tunnel next to me.
Sophie?
I think it was Rebecca cos loads of plugs kept rolling into my bit.
You have voted for Harvey and Dani.
Ooh, get the draw straws out.
Whoever draws the short straw will be trapped.
Harvey, you have drawn the short straw.
You are the unlucky one.
I can now reveal the Saboteur was in fact...
Aaron.
Sly and secretive, that Unfortunate will be a tough one to beat.
Harvey, you will not be leaving this room.
The others are free to pass to the next floor.
P...Trapped!
Harvey, how do you feel about being trapped?
I don't mind. I've got some trolleys to slide about on.
Poor Unfortunate Harvey.
You're trapped!
Oh, that was a close one.
But not for the Saboteur.
Aaron was sneakier than a wily sneak in a pair of new sneakers.
Floor Four, snake attack.
That snake is starving. It once ate a whole Unfortunate in one go
as a starter.
A strange wall faces the Unfortunates.
One of them must make it safely from one side to another
choosing which holes to put their hands in.
They must choose wisely because the wall
is home to a hungry child eating python.
She'll be waiting in one of the holes for a little snack.
It's simple, if they get bitten three times
they fail.
But it's not just the snake who'll be a slippery customer.
Who will the voice choose on this floor?
'Sophie, do not react, you are the saboteur.
'It is your job to ensure your team fail this challenge.
'I will tell you where the snake is.
'Use your powers of persuasion but be careful,
'you don't want to be detected.
'I will guide you through your Whisper Clip.'
If Sophie fools the team, one of them could be hiss tory.
Unfortunates, this is snake attack.
To pass, you must avoid the child eating python.
Let the challenge begin now.
'The snake is in the top hole.'
I think this one.
'Agree with Dani.'
Yeah, go with Dani then.
'Here it comes.'
Ow!
'Brilliant, Dani led you to the first bite.
'Bottom hole this time.'
How about the bottom? Somewhere down the bottom.
I don't know. Choose your own one.
I don't know.
Middle or top?
'OK, let them have this one. Good call.'
Yeah!
'Try and look pleased. Don't give the game away.
'The snake is in the middle hole.'
  The middle.
  'Keep persuading them.'
  Go for that one.
  Yeah.
  'Watch out!'
  Oh!
  Thanks(!)
  'Well done.
'If they pick the bottom hole then they fail the challenge.'
What one? Bottom?
  'Agree with her.'
  Yeah! The bottom.
  Bottom one.
  Really?
I'll take Dani's advice.
'Brilliant. She thinks it was Dani's choice.'
Ow!
'You have failed miserably.'
I think the Saboteur did well good.
But will it be enough!
You must now vote for who you think the Saboteur was, and why.
Sophie, who do you think the Saboteur was, and why?
I think Dani, because she kept on making all the decisions,
and she got a couple wrong.
Aaron?
Dani, because she kept on picking the ones what Rebecca didn't want to
and they were wrong.
Rebecca?
I think it was Dani, because she was quite loud and making the decisions.
Dani?
I think it was Aaron, he wasn't saying very much.
You have voted for Dani.
I can now reveal the Saboteur was in fact...
Sophie!
Oh! A successful sabotage, and they kept their identity secret.
That's how to play the game.
Dani, you will not be leaving this room.
The others are free to pass to the next floor.
Dani, why do you think the others voted for you?
Because I was saying too much, and I got all three wrong.
Poor Unfortunate Dani!
You're trapped!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ooh, Rebecca put her hand in the world, but Dani got the bite.
Floor Three   the One Eyed Watcher.
Oh, the One Eyed Watcher is a strange circus sideshow.
When he says he'll keep his eye on ya, he means it.
Roll up, roll up for the One Eyed Watcher.
He'll be keeping one eye on the Unfortunates,
and his other eye on the table.
To pass this challenge, Unfortunates must follow his eyeball and find it
under the gold cups three times.
Get it wrong three times, and they will fail!
There's only three, so who will it be?
It's time to pick the Saboteur.
'Sophie, do not react. It's you again.
'It's your job to ensure your team fails the challenge.
'You can do this by making sure your team pick the wrong cup.
'I will tell you where the eye is each time.
'It's up to you how you use this information.
'I will guide you through your Whisper Clip.'
A meddler in their midst, but can Sophie convince them?
Unfortunates, this is the One Eyed Watcher.
To pass, you must find the eye three times.
Let the challenge begin...now!
'OK, Sophie, in this game, you must use your powers of persuasion.
'The eye is under cup number one,
'avoid it.'
  Um...
  Two?
I think it was one.
I think it was two.
'Yes! Agree!'
  We'll go for two, then?
'Hmm, well done!
'Can't wait to see their faces!
'Good acting, Sophie!
'Here we go again. One down, two to go.
'The eye is under cup number two. Ask one of the others.'
Rebecca, what do you think?
  I think it was two.
  I think it was two.
'Oh no! Let them have this one.'
OK then. Go on, Aaron.
'Remember to look pleased!'
'This time, do whatever it takes to make sure they don't find the eye.
'It's under cup number two.'
I didn't see that.
I think that was two.
OK, two.
I do think it's two.
  'No.'
  It's one.
I think it slipped under one.
It might do, I don't know.
Go for one? Or three?
I think it's two.
I think it's one, because it slipped under.
Choose one. Yeah, go for two.
'Aaron is not listening to you. Don't back down.'
  We should go for one.
  One, Aaron?
  Go for one.
  Yeah, one.
'Excellent.'
It might work. Cross fingers.
'Look concerned.'
Please, please, please.
Ooh! I'm sorry.
I knew it.
'Avoid the eye this time, and they fail.
'It's under cup number three. You can do this, Sophie.
'But be careful. Aaron may be on to you.'
I reckon it was two.
'Brilliant! Agree with Aaron.'
Um, I think Aaron, cos you was right last time, and I was wrong.
We'll go for number two.
'Sneaky!'
'Well done.'
You have failed!
I think that all went rather well.
Or did it?
You must now vote for who you think the Saboteur was, and why.
Sophie, who do you think the Saboteur was and why?
I think Rebecca, she was a bit quiet and wasn't making many decisions.
Aaron?
Rebecca, she kept picking ones when we were going to pick other ones
what were right.
Rebecca?
Sophie, because she kept picking the wrong ones.
You have voted for Rebecca.
I can now reveal the Saboteur was, in fact...
Sophie!
What a crafty Unfortunate.
Rebecca, you will not be leaving this room.
The others are free to pass to the next floor.
Rebecca, how do you feel about being trapped?
Quite sorry, because I wasn't actually a Saboteur.
Poor Unfortunate Rebecca! You're trapped!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Poor Rebecca just didn't keep her eye on the ball.
Or rather, her eye on the eye.
Floor Two. One way out, and there can only be one winner.
It's the Fight For Freedom!
To win the Key of Freedom, Unfortunates must answer questions
on their time in the Tower. It's simple.
Win and they'll escape.
Lose, and they'll be trapped!
I'm so excited, I could marry a monkey.
Unfortunates, this is your Fight For Freedom.
The Unfortunate with the most correct answers will be the winner.
You have 60 seconds to prove yourself.
Let the challenge begin...now!

That's scary.
Sophie and Aaron, your time is up.
Sophie, you answered three questions correctly.
Aaron, you answered two questions correctly.
Sophie, you are the winner. Congratulations.
Aaron, how do you feel about being trapped?
Quite sad, but at least I got this far and I'm having fun.
Poor Unfortunate Aaron.
You're trapped!
Sophie, you have won your freedom. Take the key and leave the Tower
before I change my mind.
Yes!
I predict that Sophie has escaped from the Tower.
True. I predict that you lot will come back next time.
True!
It's the One Eyed Watcher!
Oh, and he wants his turban back.
He's going angrified with me. I should hide.
And of course, you too.
Well, you wouldn't want to get... trapped!
