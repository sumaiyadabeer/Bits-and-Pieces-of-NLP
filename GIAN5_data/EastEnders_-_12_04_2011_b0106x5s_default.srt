No...
Oh, love 'em!
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am running so late!
There's been a mix up with the flowers, and they've sent the wrong wine for the reception.
What does it matter what wine you get, long as it's over 12%?
I said not in the house, Mum!
Ain't lit it yet, have I?
  I see your house guest's still here.
  Yeah, don't I know it!
I really wanted to enjoy tonight, but I've still got so much left to do.
I haven't even started to get Oscar ready for Greg's mum yet...
And breathe!
I will get Oscar ready. Then we'll sort everything out.
You are going to enjoy tonight. Or else!
Yes, boss!
But first things first, eh?
  How's your mum?
  Excited.
  You are all right about tomorrow, ain't you?
  Why wouldn't I be?
Lauren, I'm fine.
Ron, please! It's Shirley and Phil's night off, one of the barmaids has called in sick.
I would not ask, but it's Tanya's hen night...
I haven't been there in ages, I wouldn't know where anything is.
And what about James?
  Dot can look after him.
  You trust her, don't you?
  I can't!
  Nothing's changed.
So she doesn't want to work all night, I can't blame her for that.
I Just thought it would be better.
She'll be back to her old self, she will.
  She needs time, all right?
  Well, how much time?
Dunno. I've got to go. I'll see you later, yeah?
I think I will go out tonight, if it's all right with you
Oh, yeah?
  Why the sudden change of heart?
  I want you to have a good night without stressing about me.
You deserve it.
There she is!
There's the woman I married.
  What you doing here?
  Come to pick up the stag.
All right, I got some special T shirts printed up.
Nice one. Get it out.
  Here you go, I'll show you my one.
  Mate, I can't wear that!
  Why not?
My name's not Gregory, it's Greg.
I know. But it's like the film,   Gregory's Girls? Gregory's Guys!
Ian, it's just a bit, a bit much.
Does that say Gregory's Gays?
I've got some stag antlers as well.
  Maybe we could all meet up later?
  I don't think so, Ian.
  It's bad luck.
  All right, fine.
I'm sure we can go down the new lap dancing club in town, give us a group discount, won't they?
Go. I trust you! You have a nice time.
See, this is why I love you.
  Just think, this time tomorrow you'll be Mrs Jessop!
  I can't wait!
He's got the brawn.
  Shame there ain't much upstairs.
  Mum, you don't even know him!
The older you get, the less of a mystery men are.
He's an open book... and it's the big print kind.
Don't worry, I'm going outside.
  I am calm.
  You're calm.
  I am calm.
  Calm.
I ain't had time to ask to her yet!
Look who we've got here.
Oh, I didn't know you were baby sitting.
He was sprung on me, weren't you?
Jack seems to think I've got nothing better to do with me time.
Still, never let it be said that I'm one to shirk me family duty.
  Now, you look after him, I'll go and see what Jim's up to.
  Dot?
He doesn't really know me, does he?
Well, you're ever so good with children, Whitney.
And I ain't much use with one arm, am I?
Now, your Aunty Whitney's going to look after you.
Are you his aunty or his cousin?
It's hard to tell as far as Jack's concerned.
I'm clean, right? I'm staying clean.
  I've heard it all before, Rain.
  Straight up. I'm not even drinking.
And I'm seeing a counsellor.
And she reckons that it's important that I reconnect with the family.
That's why I'm staying at Mum's.
  You never said.
  You never asked.
It's your wedding tomorrow, and your family should be there.
You're still a Cross deep down, or had you forgotten that?
Can't you just stay a bit longer?
Don't want to be mistaken for the stripper, do I?
  You know what those hen parties are like.
  They'd have to get through me first, won't they?
Ron!
You came! Oh, Ron, you look gorgeous!
  Oh, thank you.
  You both do. Me and Jack'd better watch out.
See ya. Behave yourselves.
This is great, innit? Us lads, off the leash, out on the lash, eh!
  Didn't Jane give you your marching orders?
  No, it was the other way round.
  Either way, he's doing a good job. Cheers.
  Yeah.
  Oi oi!
  Here's the boys! How you doing?
  What have you got on your head?
  There you go.
  Are you having a laugh?
  No?
  Are you aware that your T shirt's on the wrong way round?
  Er, yeah.
  Well, come on then, what's it say?
No, it's all right.
We've got a duty!
She ain't going to have a night to remember with Jane Beale and my sister.
  They'll have her reading books.
  Are you invited?
These are my invites, those are yours. We're women!
It's our right to give our sister a good send off.
Besides, I don't want to be the only one gatecrashing.
  Well, I'm up for it.
  Thank you.
  Alfie needs me here.
  At a stag do? Oh, please, give the man a break!
Hey hey, I'm staying out of it!
Kat, come on. One night's not going to hurt, is it, eh?
All right. But no ogling the strippers, getting drunk and doing your elephant impression.
Hey, you can stop laughing. I normally save that impression for you, don't I?
And get these cleared up.
Or Nellie will be packing his trunk and saying goodbye to the circus for the foreseeable.
  I'll get my face on.
  Oooh! Have fun, all right?
  You all right?
  Yeah. I just saw your missus at the R&R.
  You two back on track then?
  We weren't ever off track.
  Weren't you?
All right. Let's just say, I think we're over the worst of it. That's for sure.
  You look nice.
  Likewise.
Blimey, Max! The years ain't been kind to your bonce!
Lovely to see you, Cora.
Charming as always. All right, Rainie? Surprised to see you round here.
I wouldn't be too judgemental if I was you, Max. Glass houses and that.
  Uh... Right, I've got these jackets for you two.
  Oh, yeah.
All set for the big day?
  Yes, thanks.
  No last minute wobbles?
No, this time I know I've got someone I can rely on.
Reliability, cos that's the foundation of all the great love stories.
Ignore him. Go on, you're already late.
Tell Greg not to get too drunk, will you?
I've got plans for him later. Here, Mum!
Oh, it's my hen do, I'm not drinking, this is just water, promise, sir...
Her old man chased me all the way down the Mile End Road.
I've still got the dressing gown!
Hang on, hang on. He changes that story every year.
Cos last time you were telling, you were wearing the geezer's boxer shorts.
Max! Come on, join the party.
Here you go fellas, a special drink for a special occasion. Known as the Stag Stingers.
Guaranteed to put hairs on your chest. Just ask Mo.
  You tried giving me that, it tastes like aviation fluid.
  If you can't handle it.
  Course we can. Down in one, eh lads?
  Come on then, boys, down in one!
Go, go, go... What do you reckon?
  Tastes all right to me.
  I shall keep 'em coming then.
Jane used to hate me having cocktails. Reckoned I turned into a wreck after one. What does she know.
  You want a drink, mate?
  I'm all right. I'll stick with scotch.
Scotch for my man here, please!
Mum actually wanted me to join 'em.
Can you imagine? It'd be like going on a night out with them Loose Women.
Nan's still got that same scary look she had on my eighth birthday
when she threw up all over my Happy Meal.
Awww, you seeing Jay?
  You know, dressing up like Jodie won't stop you getting ID'd at a bar.
  We're staying in, actually.
And we need the place to ourselves, so could you go out? Please.
  Wait, you're not going to...?
  Oh, what is the big deal?
  You were the one who said act like a sophisticated woman.
  Abs!
  No lectures, Lauren!
  All right, fine.
I'll go see Whitney.
Take it.
Well, he might not bring any. Boys are pretty rubbish like that.
If he steps out of line, you call me, yeah?
When's the stripper getting here? Hope you've got a fit one.
I haven't booked a stripper. It was on Tanya's orders!
Yeah. Why would I want to ogle some stranger when I've got prime beefcake back at home?
I don't care what quality the steak is, everyone wants a dirty burger now and then   ask your ex.
  Ladies, can I get you some more drinks?
  Yeah, we'll have another bottle, please Ron.
Nice to see you out and about, it seems like ages.
This is my sister, Rainie.
Me mum, Cora. This is Ronnie.
  Hello.
  Phil and Shirley in tonight?
  No, that's why I'm helping Roxy out.
  How's James?
  Yeah, he's fine, thank you.
  He's good.
  Oh, I bet he's so cute! Have you got a photo?
  No, I haven't. I'll get the drinks.
What about we get this party started properly.
  Flaming sambucas?
  Yay!
On second thoughts, it could be a fire hazard, the amount of hairspray she's got on.
  You're not exactly light on the lacquer yourself, love.
  Woooo!
  That lot all right?
  No, not really.
  I think there's going to be a fight between Tanya's mum and Vanessa.
  Really? My money's on Nana Kray.
  No one told me Tanya invited Kat.
  I didn't. Or Kim. Or Mo.
Sorry we're late.
I picked up a few stragglers.
Oh, yeah, I see that. You know what? The more the merrier.
We ain't missed the stripper, have we?
  There ain't no stripper.
  You're having a laugh?
  No.
  Might as well go home then!
  Well, sorry it's not up to your standards and all that!
  We're here now, ain't we?
  You all right?
  Yeah. I'm fine.
Hey, hey, baby
Oh ah, I want to know...
Alfie, another large one, please.
What does Tanya see in him?
What, apart from youth, good looks, money, popularity, and a six pack...
Why don't you marry him?
He's a good catch, you've go to admit.
I know what Tanya wants, and it ain't that.
She likes a challenge, not a lapdog. You know, where's the edge?
And the danger? If Greg's happy getting her on the rebound, that's his look out, ain't it?
Can we have a word...alone?
I didn't mean any of that.
You know what, mate? I ain't even bothered.
In fact, I'm nothing but grateful to you, Max.
See, if you hadn't spent most of your marriage to Tanya lying, cheating,
generally being a terrible husband, you and her might still be together.
Really, I ought to thank you. Cheers.
Typical Max. Spends so much of his life looking back,
he can't see a good thing when it's in front of him.
Who is fitter though? Vanessa or Tanya?
I'm not going there!
That's right.
  Cos you and Tanya had a fling didn't you? Dirty boy!
  Oi...
Hey hey, fair play, there's no point comparing the bodywork
when you've only taken one for a test drive.
It's got nothing to do with that. Vanessa's not my type.
It's like Ronnie and Roxy. Ron's got all the class, Roxy's all brass.
  Is that right?
  Look, I ain't saying there's anything wrong with her, she's just not my type.
You want a laugh, no hassles, then Roxy's your girl.
But it takes a more than a winning smile and banter to land a woman like Ronnie.
  Tanya wins!
  Always took a good drink, my Tan.
Remember that time you got arrested
for necking Thunderbird down the social club,
  then nicking a kid's bike?
  All right, Mum. All right!
I have seen you in a whole new light.
Talk of the estate for weeks.
I didn't know you grew up on an estate, Tanya.
Anything wrong with that?
Look, don't matter where you come from, with class, you either got it or you ain't.
Me and Denise, we've always had it, innit it, D?
  It's that tequila. I'm not having no more.
  I am!
Pre wedding jitters?
I have not got the jitters actually!
I know that Greg's the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.
Aww, that is so romantic!
Can't be any worse than her first husband, could it?
I need the loo.
That's her new dress!
Oh, sorry darling, it was an accident.
Well, sorry won't cut it, love.
Here Kat, tell her!
It's all right, Nan. Can I help you?
  Your mum's all right.
  Yeah.
So, tell us about this estate you grew up on then.
Let's have a dance. Ronnie can you put on something a bit older  
  Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Spandau?
  Who?
  I'll see what I can do.
I tell you what, why don't you join us? It might cheer you up a bit.
Come on. I ain't going to get in the queue. Can you just let me in?
Not tonight.
  Popcorn?
  Come and sit down.
Have I told you how great you look tonight?
Have I missed anything important?
Oh, no.
I can't really get into it, to be honest.
Um, did you want to watch something else?
Not really.
  I'm a bit tired, to be honest.
  Oh.
Not that tired, though.
  I can't believe Grandma hasn't even got a DVD player
  cable.
If you ask me, she's got the right idea.
I mean, all them channels used to drive me mad.
You'll be taking up knitting next.
No, I won't.
Listen, we could listen to music.
Yeah. Or we could go out.
You're getting old before your time, sitting in here.
I hope you're partial to spaghetti hoops, Lauren.
Cos I've managed to rustle some up.
Now, have you found anything nice for us to watch on the telly?
When the working day is done Girls, they wanna have fun...
Roxy! Come on, come on, come on!
Girls, just wanna have fun
Wanna have fun, girls
What is it with you? You've had that face on you all night.
In fact, you've always got that face on you!
What could possibly be wrong with your life, eh, Ronnie?
You've got a beautiful baby, perfect.
And you walk around with a face like that.
You wanna be in my head.
No, scrap that.
You don't wanna be in my head.
Know what I used to wish for, my Tommy died?
I used to wish that it was your baby that died instead of mine.
Yeah, I did.
You have got no idea what you've got! None!
Everything all right?
Oh, forget it.
You will never understand.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah. I mean, if you are?
  Yeah. I'm sure, yeah!
  Great.
Can we...just take it slow, though?
Yeah, course.
Like... Like slower than that?
  Why don't we just watch a bit of telly, have a cuddle? We don't have to do this today.
  Don't we?
Not if you don't want to. You ain't got to do anything you don't want to do, Abs.
One, two, three... Oh, no, I'll never get round the board at this rate.
  I'll go!
  No no. No, I'll go.
And I'll bring you back a nice cup of cocoa.
All right, fine! Next time we're gonna go out.
Good. So how about tomorrow, then, my mum's wedding?
Hey! Where you going?
Come back!
Roxy...
  Yes?
  Do you mind if I go a bit early? I'm just missing James. I've had a really good time,
  but you can manage on your own, can't you?
  Yeah, go on. I'll see you tomorrow.
Tanya? Tan?
I'll just get some fresh air.
Tanya?
You all right?
  Tan?
It's OK. It's all right. It's OK.
Sorry.
Tanya?
D'you want me to take you home?
I'm fine.
I was just, you know, just trying to help.
Hm. Let's go back inside, Tan.
  Calling it a night.
  Oh, you lightweights. One more for the road?
'Ey, make sure you don't get sick outside!
Oh, get him home...
  Has Michael gone?
  Looks that way, mate, don't it?
So much for my big night out.
  What happened to you?
  Just get me a drink, will you?
Kat. Time to go.
Oi, service! Hello?
Never seen Tanya that drunk before.
Bet she never let Max see her like that. What a turn off.
  Tanya, I don't think you should have any more.
  I'm fine now.
  But you were sick outside!
  Sometimes you're such a stick in the mud.
Why am I the bad guy all of a sudden? Is it because I interrupted you and Maxy outside?
  Don't be ridiculous!
  I don't even know why you give him the time of day.
  Are you jealous, is that what this is?
  Where did that come from?
Yeah, I saw you, with Greg, just drooling. Practically had your tongue hanging out.
  Shut up!
  Yeah, I'm sorry that you and Ian have split up, all right?
But you wanna find yourself your own fella.
Well, you... you can just find yourself a new matron of honour, Tanya!
Oi... Jane?
  No!
  Jane!
  No!
  Jane!
  No!
What do you want?
The same as you.
If you don't go away I'm actually gonna call Jack.
No, you won't.
Why'd you run off and leave him holding the baby?
  That's none of your business.
  All right.
Why'd you nick that photo of me?
Why is it, then, whenever I'm near you... See?
  You shake like a leaf?
  Just stop it.
Stop it.
You still haven't rung Jack.
You playing hard to get just makes me want you more.
Night night, beautiful.
  There we go.
  She all right? HE CHUCKLES
She will be once she sleeps it off.
Ahhh. D'you have a good night, darling, yeah?
In case you're interested, I managed to get rid of all those cocktails, so we are quids in!
Room spinning, is it? Look.
Got this just in case, OK? All right.
I want it to stop, Alfie.
I know.
All right. Come on.
You get some sleep, all right?
There you go.
Jane...
Jane, I love you.
All right, Ian.
Listen, Ian's on the sofa. He's pretty out of it.
Don't wake him up, all right?
  Right.
What happened?
Me and Tanya, we had a row.
Ohhh... Listen, you two'll both make it up. You will.
  You're both too nice to hold a grudge, aren't you?
  Oh, Greg.
You know, Tanya...
Tanya doesn't know how lucky she is, having you.
Oh...
  Oh, I'm so sorry, Greg. I shouldn't have done that.
  Er...
Yeah, maybe...forget about that. All right?
I'd better be off. All right?
All right, babe?
  I'm gonna go upstairs.
  I'm not tired yet.
Yeah, well, I am.
Um, is Abi watching TV up there?
I assumed she was asleep.
"Interception!" KNOCK AT DOOR
  What's all this? What's all this?
  Dad, don't!
  Max!
  Nothing even happened!
  We didn't do anything, all right, Max?
  Dad!
Do you value your life? Do you?
Get out my house! Go on, toe rag!
Bell ya later, Abs.
  What's all this? What d'you think you're doing?
  I'm staying at Mum's.
  No, you ain't!
  Maybe you should let her go while you calm down.
  What, am I talking to you?
Abs, come here! You're not going anywhere!
I didn't mean to do that.
Abs?
Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime...
Abs, don't be like that. I didn't mean to do it, did I?
Abs, don't be like that, just come back here!
I hate you.
  I'm staying here tonight.
  What happened?
Nothing happened, Greg. None of your business, that's what happened.
Well, it's my business. Someone gonna fill me in?
  Max?
  We just... We just had words, that's all.
  What's he done?
Go to bed, Max, you're wasted.
  Shut up, Cora, look at the state of you. You can't talk, can you?
  Oi.
All right, get inside. Go on, inside.
  Lauren, inside.
  Yeah, in a minute. I just want to talk to Dad.
V, go home, I'll see you there in a minute. I just want a little chat with Lauren.
Why do you always do this?
Can't you stand anyone else being happy?
  You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
  Yes, I do.
I mean, you hate seeing Mum with Greg and you want her back.
But it's too late, Dad, she's made her choice.
Promise me that you won't do anything to spoil tomorrow, that you'll let her have her big day.
Please, Dad, promise me.
I can't.
