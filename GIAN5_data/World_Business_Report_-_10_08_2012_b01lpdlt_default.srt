economic weakness. And a scandal. Can the interest rate problem be
fixed? We will tackle that later today.
We will catch up with Rico Hizon shortly. Let's talk about the
shares in Manchester United which started trading in New York today.
Masses are united is the richest football club in the world.   
debts. To bring it to the US is certainly a unique choice but it
shows the connection to they    the brand. The second half of the club
will go back to its own nose. The fans want the money spent on the
players.    its owners. 50% of the problem is going back to the people
who own it. I think all of it should be used in the club. Some
may look at New York as an unusual choice but one reason for selling
shares in the US is so the family can retain f the club
through their shares which have ten times more voting power than those
available to the public. That would have been possible on the London
Stock Exchange. That is a worry for this investor, already concerned
the shares are too pricey. After selling 10% of the shares they will
still have 99% of the voting power, issues.
world. The US financial markets are another game altogether.
Let's head to Asia. Further evidence of the slowing Chinese
economy with export figures weaker than expected. Great to see you and
I mention the word weaker than expected but who are we kidding? We
are talking about a plunge in the trade growth? Absolutely. That is
why it is moving markets. It was a huge disappointing, these July
trading numbers. Exports have risen just 1% from last year, and the
weakest rise since January. There was a forecast for a 6% rise. This
was the weakest pace of export twice in the past year. We were
hoping for a 7.2% increase. The wide margin as to a bad set of
monthly reports which came out from producer prices. Faltering demand
from the two largest customers of China, the US and Europe, is the
major culprit. The Commerce Minister of China says it will be a
major challenge for the mainland to meet its growth target of 10%.
Thank you. Given we had disappointing numbers from China
yesterday, all eyes will certainly be on what Beijing will do. We will
talk to you saying. Let's touch on some of the other stories. They
could be a switch in strategy at Yahoo!. The new chief executive may
revise their plans to pay shareholders millions of dollars
from the sale of a stake in another company. The previous management
had promised to reward shareholders but that I may not go ahead.
Gordon price has hit a record. The price of corn hit a record of $8
for every bushel. That has already added to a rise in June. There is
concern the food crisis of 2008 could be repeated.
Japan's sales tax is set to double. Parliament will vote this Friday.
The plan is to raise the tax from 5% to 10% by 2015. The Prime
Minister says the tax rise is essential to reduce the debt burden.
Let's move on and talk about the interest rate scandal because it is
certainly causing a lot of damage to the banking industry. Let's
cross to the top executives of Barclays. Investigations are on
going to see if other banks will also be setting the interest rate.
This is a benchmark for trillions of dollars of loans and other
products. It is said by the banks themselves to submit rates at which
they would learn to themselves. The banking industry cannot abandon
this interest rate. I an ice pick into the chief executive of a
company and he will present his initial thoughts on this scandal.
Interesting stuff. Douglas Keay was a trader at Morgan Stanley in the
early 1990s and chance up. We talk about this scandal at the moment   
and joins us. Until 2008, you wear it in the industry in the early 90s
and have written that back then the interest rate did not appear to be
what they should have been. started trading 1991 and
regulations, when I first came across them, I was shocked. I talk
to my colleagues and they thought it was humorous but I was so naive
to think the rate was actually accurate. Explain how they
manipulated these figures? Under the trading scheme I could see all
of the office. I could see where light for was says selling each day,
the official rate. It was different from the actual rate being traded
in the market. What is interesting is that we talk about the London
rate, but if this has been going on for a couple of decades, surely
there must be others? Do you think there are others around the world
who were in on this? I cannot say but what I can say is that inner
London, for example, the Bank of England is clearly involved    in
London. The highest authorities? Yes. Correct. I know you do not
want to speculates about these initial thoughts on the report
because that comes out later today. But how do you fix the problem?
They are talking about having the rate based on monthly rates which
is a huge step in the right direction. That is what it should
be in the first place. Yes. appreciate your time. Thank you.
We should also just note that Barclays has named David Walker as
its new chairman. He was formerly an official at the Bank of England
and the Treasury. His first task will be to find the new chief
executive following the resignation of Bob Diamond. Now a look at the
markets. Rico Hizon said that the Chinese numbers are in dismal
territory with poor export growth. The growth number came in just 1%
