On the on the road to promotion but can Huddersfield keep hold of their
sensation. He won't be sold it's not possible. The Wednesday fans
her definitely into Milan. changed everything. Good players
coming end   brilliant. Good evening. It seems like it's
been a long time, but we're back for the long run in   and with me
for day one, is the former boss of Scunthorpe & Sheffield Wednesday
Brian Laws, and the man who led Hull City into the Premier League,
Mr Phil Brown. And throughout the series you can get in touch via
twitter. Tweet me directly @guymowbray or the producer would
love to pretend he's got friends too, get him via @bbclkoyl. Get
tweeting. But there's only really one place
we can start this week. I'm sure you've seen the news over the
weekend about Dean Windass, our friend on Late Kick Off, my friend,
who's revealed that since retirement he's been struggling
with depression. Indeed on two occasions he even attempted suicide.
You're his manager at Hull, the news shocked me to the course. As
put to him yesterday and he's doing OK but it is an ongoing situation.
I was as shocked as you were. I got a phone call when I was walking the
dogs to say had I seen the front page of the people. Obviously, I
bought and read the story. That picture that you showed of Dean in
front of the fans   his beloved France. He was born and bred in
Hull and supported them as a kid. You can just imagine him being a
bomb    a wants that. We thought of the moment he jumped up and saluted
the fans, it was a typical Dean Windass prank. This one was not a
keeps cropping up   a common topic of conversation for sportspeople,
what happens when it finishes? is the sad part. Nobody understands
and less you are in the sport. Dean has been in the sport from day one,
born through it and had many years of success and enjoyment. It is
such an adrenalin rush. It is not like any other industry. When you
come out of it and it stops immediately, where is your
adrenalin rush. It is like a drug and you need it. I think he missed
that. He has not gone into the management side, which is second
best. He cannot play, coach or manager. Been just cut it short and
is not involved any more. That has not helped him at all. There aren't
enough coach jobs for everyone so something must fill the gap.
think the media work he was doing at first filled a gap. His face was
on TV and people were listening to them about football but you have to
go home at the end of the night and back to the family. Your family and
friends are the most important people. When you have finished your
fit bolt, they are the most important people. Deane has to
understand, what made him as a player. He had tough times, he was
bent by Brian Horton in the early days. He went back on the building
sites and one his opportunity to come back to fit all. He has gone
from good times to bat times to that magnificent moment at Wembley.
   football. Howdy come down from that and where do you go? He has to
understand he is a strong character and he will come through this.
has friends. We know you're watching and we send you nothing
but best wishes. On we go, to the most talked about
striker in English Football outside the Premier League. Huddersfield
Town's Jordan Rhodes has scored more hat tricks this season than
I've scored in a lifetime of five  a side! Rob Jones has been to see
him to discover how he does it. Huddersfield Town are right in the
middle of the leadership battle. Huddersfield's charge to the
championship is spearheaded by a strike could Jordan Rhodes. He has
been crucial this season and been putting up some impressive numbers
The chance for a    transfer window is in full swing and roads is the
hottest property. Premier League clubs are circling and surely every
player has his price? Jordan Rhodes has been linked with every club
outside Manchester and his boss believes the speculation is helping
his game. As for Jordan Rhodes himself, he claims he is taking no
notice of the headlines. What was said a what gets written about me
or any of my team mates, or anyone associated with Huddersfield Town,
is for someone else to write about. It is for them to comment on, not
me. I am sticking to what I am trying to do and what I love doing.
All parties involved in taking care of Jordan Rhodes remain united. The
striker says there have been no discussions with the chairman
regarding his position. We'll just gearing up towards the same thing.
I do not think the manager or the chairman has had conversations with
any of the other Huddersfield squad in the changing room, so it is not
for me to be different. After five goals the week before, he drew
apart    a surprising blank last Saturday. They found salvation in
the form of Irishmen behind me. His goal lifted them up to third. But
for the manager, the key question was whether further inquiries about
Jordan Rhodes? I have had lots. and the chairmen are continuing to
stand firm? Me and the chairman and Jordan. Nothing has changed. He
will be here on 1st February. We have had the conversations, we know
what is being said and we trust each other. We know what is going
on and we have covered everything. Jordan's goals could well prove the
difference between promotion and another near Ness. His chairman
says his value is out on the pitch. Promotion is important to us. He is
an important cog. Promotion is the most important thing for us. We
have more of a chance with Jordan playing for us than not. Those
interested parties, the majority are Premier League clubs, are they?
They are. But he cannot be sold, it is just impossible. Huddersfield
seem to have the determination that that their most valuable asset is
going nowhere in the January sales. That is great ear for the fans. How
great is he? Anybody can scold goals and a regular basis but they
have a prize asset there.    score goals. It is fantastic to hear the
chairman say he will not go. He will goal eventually but their
ambition is to get out of this division and he is vital to that
cause. We have seen him a few times this season and he is a natural
goalscorer. A very level headed lad   unlike his father! He is like his
mother. Certainly, Huddersfield and in a great position. It can hold
onto them, get promotion and talk about it later. That must be great
to hear the chairman like that. absolutely. He has good people
around them. He has good back rooms staff advising him. As Brian says,
the advice coming to Jordan from his father Andy must be keen. His
career has just taken off. Which you want to move now? Or progress
with your own club, get promotion and get that with your CV and try
your luck in the championship. You never know. He might just settle
into Huddersfield for the championship. They are all kinds of
goals in there and team play as well. His touch is first class. His
awareness is then a kid. He is not just a goalscorer. We talk about
touch and the fact he is a level  headed lad, but his finishing is
from all angles. He can use both feet. He doesn't just blasts them
in. He is a natural goalscorer and has a great future. He was let goal
from its which quite quickly, anyone's you let him get away too
easily? Probably Bobby's a morale. I might still be manager and we
might still be in their Premier League. We talked about Jordan's
dads and that leads us on nicely to her next article.    our next
article. It's just over a year since Milan Mandaric took over at
Sheffield Wednesday. Last season was a struggle at Hillsborough,
first under Alan Irvine and then as his replacement Gary Megson got
himself re acquainted with the place. This year the Owls are in
the thick of the promotion battle, alongside Huddersfield and
Sheffield United, and the visitors on Saturday were league leaders
Charlton Athletic. Paul Burland went to watch it for us. The 21st
century has not been kind to Sheffield Wednesday, relegated from
the Premier League in 2000. There is genuine hope that under Milan
Mandaric and Megson, they have the right team to get them back to
where they feel they belong. I am very happy to be here. I have
a lot of good people on the field and good management of the field. I
have said over and over, tremendous support from the supporters who
really appreciate and you do not full these people. They know who's
who and they trust you and get behind you. They have a reason to
trust us. We were nowhere and now Milan
Mandaric is comment and it is brilliant. The ground is full every
week. It is one of the best relationships we have had a while.
The fans talk to them. A what would you say to the chairman? Well done.
Keep going. I am is desperate as every when you say today, as this
community to get this first step back to the championship. Everyone
you see today. Then we can go from there. This belongs    his club
deserves to be one of the top teams in England. You cannot be happy
until you get there. Milan Mandaric has a reputation as a difficult man
to please. He replaced Alan Irvine with deep next in. Milan Mandaric
offered him the job at Portsmouth as well, which Megson turned down.
He is a great man as a human being. Things did not work Kennet but he's
one of the nicest football people I met as a person. I just wanted him
to be successful. As much as the media accuse me sometimes that I
fire managers but it is not my pleasure to do that. I do not like
to fire people. I like to have good people. It takes some work. You
have to make changes. I have hired Gary for the third time so we will
You always take over a club that plays in blue. Yes, that is
interesting. My grant it daughter said that. She said will you take
over a club that has the red colour? As long as I am here,
things will be OK. We will work hard together. Marvellous. We will
talk Wednesday in a moment and Milan may not want to talk about
United, but we do, as BBC Radio Sheffield's Paul Walker starts his
League One round up with an catastrophe for Sheffield United.
Richard Creswell put them ahead in the 55th minute. Evans got his the
18th to make it too and it was wrapped up by Lee Williamson with
10 minutes to go. United now three places ahead of Huddersfield.
Scunthorpe United got themselves ahead at Colchester, but were
pegged back with his penalty equaliser. It has been a tough time
in the division for Chesterfield. They fell behind before the break,
but after the break, they got an equaliser against Orient, which
leaves them are seven points from leaves them are seven points from
safety. Here is how it looks in League One,
with the two Sheffield clubs and Huddersfield set to battle it out
through to the end. Could they all go up? Charlton are surely the flaw
in that idea. At the other end, Scunthorpe are three unbeaten now
and just above the bottom four on goal difference. Chesterfield are
seven points from safety. A big blow for Sheffield Wednesday at the
weekend. They had been going along ever so nicely and then we turned
up with or cameras! Yes, they're talking about it stability, as you
heard there, which was not the case when I was at the club. Their home
form has been fantastic. When you get the likes of 30,000 supporters
there, they will come through you thick and thin. They have got the
right man in charge and there is a real buzz about their place. I am
really delighted for Sheffield Wednesday. You mentioned the
stability. How to do you feel when you see the current chairman
talking like that? Times have changed. You talk about a
rudderless ship. It was like you been on a management course, where
you are involved in not just the football side, but all the other
aspects of the business. In was very tough but enjoyable. But now
you have someone who is in it. It is the stable club and they have
money. It is a club which is going and only one direction. Danny
Wilson doing very well at Sheffield United as well, Phil? And the goals
are beginning to fly in yes, just talking about stability. We were
talking their about Jordan at Huddersfield. But Evans is now
doing that at Sheffield United. Maybe Jordan roads should stay at
Huddersfield. Three goal up and maybe two will go up automatically
and the other in the play offs. But maybe of Jordan stays are
Huddersfield, he could maybe take the club into the Premier League.
All of these clubs are big enough to be there. Now look at
Chesterfield. They are really struggling the division up. I do
not think anyone would have contemplated that at the start of
the season. Chesterfield were runaway winners last season and
that so many goals and them and I thought there was no way they would
struggle in League One. In the new stadium, as well. We are all
surprised by how they're doing. Coming up, Barnsley young and old
go head to head. And we've got the rest of the goals involving all our
Football League clubs. Time for a look at the Championship
action. Neil Morrow talks us through it, starting with Phil's
old club Hull City, where an old boy was officially taking over as
the first time as a full time manager of his hometown team. It
was at a winning start for him. Leeds fell behind early against
Crystal Palace. United were handed a lifeline just before the break
after falling behind, when Palace were reduced to 10 men. Roberts not
asking on as the second half substitute and clinched a point for
the Elland Road team. Doncaster manager Dean Saunders got the best
news he could with the news that Billy Sharp was staying. It was a
scoreless draw, but that was a good result against high flying Cardiff
city. Barnsley it got an impressive 2 1 victory over Leicester.
The table... Hull sixth and Leeds down three
places to 11th after this weekend's results. We are talking play offs
and the fight to be in them again this year.
Barnsley in the bottom half, but closer to the play offs than
relegation, points wise. Doncaster staying positive and so they should,
after a great display against Cardiff that should have got them
So, Nicky Barmby it has made the step up to be a manager. He did
well as the caretaker manager. How well will he do? He was always one
that I would talk to it in the dressing room. He had a great
career with the likes of Everton, Tottenham and England. That stays
with you as a player. As a manager, you would be foolish not to tap
into that experience he had as a player when you are a manager. He
was coming up with suggestions Here, There and everywhere. We had a good
changing room when he was in it. We are talking about Dean Windass and
Nick Barmby as the took long gone talents and look at the contrast
between them. You will, as buying has been wishing Sheffield
Wednesday, his old club, the best, I am doing the same thing when it
comes to halt city. He has got some quality in this dressing room. At
this level, it is very good Foreign midfielder. Yes, a few of their
victories have been just by the single goal, but they have been
very precise in their finishing. When you are winning, even by a
narrow scoreline, it becomes the nice habit. Peterborough hah the
higher scoring team in the championship. A Leeds united would
take the victory from anywhere at the moment, only one victory in the
past six games. Yes, but Crystal Palace are in such good form
themselves. They are no young team who everyone thought would be one
of the contenders to struggle. But they have let their round. They
have done ever so well in the cup competitions. So Leeds were going
to play a team who were brimming with confidence. The pressures of
last year are now beginning to mount on top of them. There was
huge expectations last year. I think that most people would have
settled for consolidation in the championship last season, but they
did so well that the pressure has been on them since they won this
season. It is a huge club. Great result for Barnsley on
Saturday, thanks to two Andy Gray goals. Time now to put two of their
other players to the test. Who knows more   a good young one or an
old good one? Only one way to find out....
Head to Head. I am David and I am a goalkeeper. I am a striker. Start
the clock. Who is the smallest player in the squad. David Perkins.
How far is it to get to Elland Road? 17 miles. We Super League
club played some home games at Oakwell? Widnes. What is the
capacity of the ground? 21,000. What is Dickie Bird was famous for?
Reuben has a social life, Preecey   get out more. You were far too
proud about winning that! Right, onto League Two, which sees
of form of late and twice the lead on Saturday. With only minutes to
go, it was one one and Bradford seemed to have stolen the points
with the late goal two minutes from time, but a late equaliser deep
into injury time made it 2 2. Swindon Town got two first half
goals, and the second half when did not do enough for them to get any
points out their game. The Millers are clinging on to a
top half place. Four points off the play offs though, that is all.
Bradford now five points away from peril, thanks to only losing one of
their last seven league games. The Bantams, maybe not flying yet, but
How often does this happen. He had been taking absolute belters as the
next player from the fans before the game. But you just know he is
going to come back and haunt you. Yes, it happens all the time. He
did a muscle good and then he goes and scores. My albeit park in his
they have. I worked under him. Bradford are pulling away nicely
and are getting to the middle of the table. You just have to keep
positive light about Bradford city. There is a big game tomorrow night
for Chesterfield   Oldham Athletic at the B2Net in the first leg of
the Johnstone's Paints Trophy Northern Final. Two games away from
Wembley. And do not forget, you will get the
tuning into your local BBC radio station.
That is us about done for the first programme, but before we go,
