We'd need to have a fixed number of beds in Darwin, ringfenced for cardiac trauma work.
  Stop Plastics taking our beds.
  Exactly.
  Ms Naylor is no longer available.
  Then ask Greg. He's a good surgeon.
  He's a liability.
  Sorry, I...
  You're late.
  Dan, you just don't get it, do you?
Just one thing   I'm more than capable of looking after myself.
  Love you.
  I love you too.
Come on, Blighty! You can do better than that!
  The ball's the wrong shape.
  Focus, please!
  Not this time, tater head!
  Aaah!
  Ah yes! And once again, ladies and gentlemen,
500 years of history overturned!
  Woo!
  Is there no chink in your armour, you miserable Hibernian weasel?
Come on, nine one.
  Technically speaking, you're...
  All over the shop.
  Exactly.
  I mean no moves, per se.
  Luck of the Irish.
  Must be.
  Thank you.
  Bit raw, are we?
No.
Nursery run.
  Hey! Big Daddy!
  Just taking my responsibilities seriously.
And she let you drop him off? All on your own io?
The thing is, a fella can be great on paper...
tick all the boxes. But once you get him on the field,
Mr once, twice, three times an orthopod...
then it becomes about something different.
Then it becomes about heart... About drive...
About determining your own destiny...
Go on, then, what is this big secret?
What drives the dastardly Mr Douglas?
Simple. Always know what you want. And if you can't win...
..don't compete.
Sister Williams.
I can take it from here!
  Oh! God!
  I am so sorry!
  Are you all right?
  And they wonder why the NHS is floundering.
  We need to get you into ED...
  WE don't need to do anything.
I am perfectly capable of dealing with my own problems. And YOU need to look where you're going.
  Your emergency department, please.
  Follow the signs.
  Thank you.
  Guilty.
  I'm sorry?
Only one reason for flowers like that. Guilt!
  Bailey! You found him!
  Sleeping rough, I'm afraid. Glove compartment.
Daniel's been in bits!
Good morning. Again.
And these! Well, thank you.
So did you get what you wanted?
Oi! Yes, thank you.
Right! Well, see you upstairs then.
  Where are you going?
  Just an errand to run. AAU. Man about a dog!
Patient for you, bay one.
  Oh! You wouldn't do that to a naked man, would you?
  You're late.
I have a whole thirty seconds on the clock!
Aw, come on...
I have to at least get a shower.
Please?
  Ordinarily, I would jump at the chance of taking on your workload in addition to my own...
  Pretty please?
But this guy seems to be in a bad way and unfortunately...
he appears to be looking for you.
So who is he?
We don't know.
Beautiful...
Merry Christmas, Mr Hamilton.
  Ooh, it's so exciting! Where's he taking you?
  I dunno.
  Ooh!
  Chip shop.
  Oh, stop it! I love secrets.
It's not a secret. It's just dinner.
  But...
  For heaven's sake!
  It's just a date.
  Well, if you'll excuse me, ladies, I've got an itch called work that wants scratching.
It's all so romantic!
D'you think... Mr Hamilton...
is he, like, could he be...
might he be...The One?
Believe me, I am light years beyond all of that!
You're not that old!
He's very weak. We've got him on oxygen and IV...
So where'd he pop up from?
Train ticket's from Manchester. But so far no luck with the hospitals there.
Catheter mark. Recent.
Manchester, huh? They seek him here, they seek him there.
  Sorry?
  The renowned Mr Douglas. Doctor D's expertise!
How're you, Cal?
Thanks for that, Mr Levy.
  There's too much mistrust in the world!
  There's just something about her.
Nonsense! You old cynic. She's just activated your shoulder chip is all.
  What?
  Rich daddy with influence so you automatically assume she's got a black heart.
  No, I don't!
  And that she deserves to suffer.
  I'm telling you, she's not what you think she is.
  She's a good doctor.
Gracious, Nurse McKee!
Surely you're not disputing the authority of Doctor X Factor?
God, no. Perish the thought.
At any rate, even if I agreed with you...
are you going to tell Sir Fraser his daughter's services are no longer required?
  Never fear, cavalry's here.
  I wish you wouldn't do that.
We thought you were way too busy with your waxworks.
Cancellation. So I thought this would be a golden opportunity
to knock this dump into shape.
Right, Senior Staff Nurse McKee? What have we got?
Good. Can you wiggle your fingers for me?
Marvellous.
  All right, so what's going on?
  I'm sorry?
  Everyone's acting weird.
  Not a clue what you're on about, I'm afraid.
  You see!
  Hmm. Funny girl.
It's not just her.
What do people know that I don't?
  Dan!
  Uh! It's impossible to keep anything under wraps in this place.
  It's supposed to be a surprise.
  What is?
Excuse me.
You work too hard.
  Hm?
  You spend your time looking after other people.
  That's my job.
So I'm going to look after you for a change.
Hold on! Wait a minute! What do you mean?
We are going on a luxury break.
  A magical mystery tour.
  When?
  Tonight.
  Tonight? For how long?
  Two days.
  Two days? I can't.
Why not?
Well, Daniel? And there's work.
Packing?
All under control.
  Trust me!
  I said I can manage!
It's not my bloody legs that are the problem!
  So you guys go back a bit, right?
  School days in Dublin.
We played soccer together.
  We were the main men, weren't we, Cal?
  Greg.
Of course. I'm sorry.
We were. Stars of the show.
So did they tell you what was wrong?
No,
we didn't stay long enough to find out.
You discharged yourself?
Why?
We wanted to come here.
See your man.
  Oh, yeah?
  We heard you were the best.
You did, did you, who from?
His mam.
OK, can also book Mr Bryan in for an echo, ECG and chest X ray, please.
Andy, we are going to get you sorted.
But I am going to have to take that away.
This!
OK. We'll see what the tests reveal, then take it from there.
  Good to see you again.
  Cal!
Greg.
Likewise.
  Cal?
  Callum.
  So that's what the "C" stands for!
  It's nice. Why'd you change it?
  I outgrew it.
Clarice Parker, 62.
Dislocation of the left shoulder after a fall.
Hello, I'm Dan Hamilton, the orthopaedic consultant.
  Suspected fractured collarbone.
  That is a humdinger! How did it happen?
I fell down the college steps.
  The college?
  I'm a lecturer.
  Ooh, golly! What in?
Modernist literature.
Eliot, Woolf, Joyce...
  More of a sportsman than a scholar myself, I'm afraid!
  We can't be good at everything.
OK. I know you're in a lot of pain
but we need the X ray results before we decide the best course.
  Do you think you can be a brave girl for me for a teensy while longer?
  Yes, Doctor.
So what did you mean, you've got everything covered?
This...luxury break.
I meant that Sacha is going to take Daniel. Which, incidentally, he's very excited about.
I had a quiet word with Hanssen.
  What?
  Booked you a couple of days off...
and Daniel helped me pack!
  Great!
  He's good.
I don't mean to sound rude, but how on earth do you know what to pack?
Maybe I'm little more observant than you're giving me credit for.
And I took advice.
This is Mr Phillips,
who's had severe abdominal pain, aching limbs and diarrhoea.
Possible gastroenteritis.
That catheter bag needs to be emptied.
< What?
Eh, Mr Levy, I wonder if you could take a look...
Hello, I'm Michael Spence. I'd shake your hand but I'm a little busy.
Hi. Mr Levy, I wonder if you could take a look
  at the patient in bed eight. I'm concerned about his temperature.
  Certainly.
Who is that?
That is Ms Hutchison. She's...
She's our new F1.
Oh, come on.
  I can't! He'll kill me!
  You don't have to tell me anything. Just answer yes or no.
Is it nearby?
Is it far away?
Is it a car journey?
A train journey?
Oh, God.
And it's really nice! I mean really, really nice.
Yes, can I help you?
X rays are back.
Clarice Parker? No fracture and she's requested a closed reduction on the ward.
Brave lady!
Going to need all hands on deck.
Yep. Two minutes.
Chantelle!
He LOVES you!
You know, I was wondering. Do you not think she might be
just a little out of your league?
If you are suggesting, Eddi, that my interest in this particular F1
is anything less than a professional nature, then...
Ah, well! Speak of the devil.
Ms Hutchison, isn't it? We haven't been properly introduced.
I'm Michael Spence, the Lead Consultant General Surgeon here.
Hi.
I've...heard all about you.
Mr Levy was suggesting since I'm around anyway, I could take some time out and mentor you.
Great! That would be...great.
Excellent. Well, there's no time like the present.
I believe a patient has been sent down from ED?
Thank you very much.
And, of course, Mr Spence has been fully appraised as to the sensitivity of the situation?
Oh, of course.
  Hi.
  Hi.
So, Sam? I'm Michael Spence, Lead Consultant. This is our trainee, Dr Hutchison...
  I understand you came off your bike?
  Oh, man. You've got to be kidding me.
  Is there a problem?
  Er, the accent. It's put on, right?
  No Mr Douglas?
  He sends his apologies.
Andy, we've had some of your initial test results back
and it seems that you have atherosclerosis...
It's a kind of blockage.
  A chalky substance...
  Builds up in the arteries. Yes, I know.
When will he be back?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Your ECG also shows some compression...
I know what I need.
Coronary artery bypass graft, yeah?
I had...
  my first heart attack when I was 24.
  I see.
So who's going to do it?
We don't know yet.
But it will be done today.
Is there anyone we should call?
We were best mates, you know.
Did he tell you that?
No, he didn't.
OK, deep breath for me...
Deep breath...
wait for it...
  Oh, God!
  Aha!
Bingo! Good girl! Right!
We need X rays to confirm the reduction and she'll have to be kept under observation
in case of arterial compromise. But with a bit of luck,
things should start to pick up!
Excuse me.
  You OK?
  Yeah!
  Sure?
  Yeah, just got stuff to do.
  Chrissie...
  Dan, I'm fine.
  Excuse me...
  Can I help you?
  I... I brought these in
for Clarice Parker. I heard she was here.
  I'll take them for you.
  It's just a few odds and ends.
Toothbrush and the like. I didn't pack it myself.
  And you are?
  Clive Beadle.
  Not her husband, then?
  Good heavens no! She's...
She's a colleague.
We're in the same department.
  I'm Romantics.
  Right.
Could I ask what happened?
I believe she slipped on some steps.
  Steps?
  Yes. Why?
Oh, no reason!
Well, thank you for your time, nurse.
  Don't you want to see her?
  No. She would only be embarrassed.
  You fool!
  That'll be the day.
  Don't they train you people at all nowadays?
I was only trying to take her pulse!
Now listen to me. I don't care how much pain you're in.
You do not abuse a member of my staff. Do you understand?
  I'm sorry. Bad day.
  Right. It happens to the best of us.
  What's that?
  Someone thoughtfully packed a few things for you.
Someone. Who someone?
You!
You have the nerve to come in here!
  Ms Parker, please!
  Viper! VIPER!
Oxygen, now!
  Hi.
  Hi.
Hi, Greg Douglas, CT.
Listen, I need to arrange a transfer...
You're aware that despite having dropped to fifth in the emission rankings,
your homeland remains a clear number one
  in terms of per capita production?
  No signs of guarding.
  And that your genocide record is the worst in the world?
  And clearly no signs of breathlessness.
Maybe that's why you left?
Any vomiting?
Lack of bowel control maybe?
I told you   just this headache.
And the...stomach thing.
Why don't you tell me what happened exactly?
Some idiot in a Volvo.
  Veering around all over the place.
  He hit you?
Just...glanced off me,
but enough to, you know...
send me flying.
OK! I'm going to order a head CT to rule out trauma and an abdo CT...
We're going to take care of the bloods.
  Bloods?
  Lulu, will you pass me a couple of syringes, please?
Is that really necessary?
Too small, too small...
Dr Hutchison, will you do the honours?
Her? Has she...
done it before?
Let's find out.
  Calm down, just calm down!
  Get your hands off me! Will you let me go!
What the hell is going on?
  Transfer to St James.
  Help me!
Please! They want to take me away. You have to help me.
Stop, stop!
There's obviously been some kind of mistake. Give me five minutes.
Five minutes!
She tried to get out of bed and blacked out.
Mm. Don't like the look of that arm. Could be a torn artery.
  I think we need to get her into theatre as soon as.
  Shouldn't we order a head CT in case?
That just loses us time. She slipped on steps. No mention of head trauma.
  Could be a bleed, though?
  No, the blackout's down to the arterial problem, believe me.
Sister Williams? It's about Ms Parker.
There's someone else here to see her.
What's going on? Andy, they're moving him.
  Ah. He's being transferred.
  Have you completely lost it?
Have the last six weeks just passed you by?
ITU is backed up all day. St James's have a slot available in two hours.
But we need the op! You know we do.
My first responsibility is to the patient and judging by his notes I think it best that he transfer.
  End of.
  Fine! But if you had spent more than five minutes talking to him,
you'd know that he is both mentally and physically too weak to be moved.
  Look, he's my friend.
  Well, take care of him then!
The decision's made. Please...just let it go.
  He doesn't want to leave.
  He doesn't know what's best for him.
He wants you as his doctor. He came here looking for YOU. Greg!
We've already lost beds to Plastics. Defer enough cardiac cases will be that many more nails in the coffin.
Please, I'm asking you...
as a colleague, as...
Please, don't send our patient away.
Doesn't add up.
What, you mean you think he's faking it?
No bruises, no grazes, just a headache and a stomach pain?
He was hit by a car, though.
Apparently.
  Hello, AAU.
  Why would you make up something like that?
  OK. Yup. I will do.
Thanks. Bye.
In case anyone's interested,
that was Chrissie. The police are on their way down. Apparently they've identified the driver.
Hi.
  Oh! Hello.
  We thought you'd gone. You OK?
She's tough going, isn't she, your colleague?
35 years I've known her.
Believe me, she doesn't get any easier on close acquaintance.
  You're not flavour of the month, are you?
  Difference of opinion. Work matter.
Clive, can I ask does Clarice has any relatives we could contact?
Not that I'm aware of. Why?
Is she all right?
She blacked out after shouting at you...
and the police are here.
They found her car buried in a tree on campus.
I saw. That's how I knew to come.
When you said she slipped on steps I... I didn't like to contradict in case...
well, in case...
I got her into trouble.
Why do you think she lied?
Look, apologies, but I must get on.
You're leaving?
I doubt she'd want me around.
It's just that we're worried about the blackout.
We think that she might have done more damage in the crash than we thought.
I really don't think there's anything I can do. I'm sorry.
And there's something else.
Whilst she was driving, the police think she hit someone.
Thanks, lads, and apologies again.
Keeping those slots filled, Mr Douglas?
Busy, busy, Ms Naylor.
OK! We have ourselves a slot.
Chantelle, could you...?
Where is she?
  Who?
  Ms Parker. Bed five.
Scans, I think.
Why?
Chrissie sent her.
  Problem?
  No.
  Just wondering why you sent my patient for a head CT when I asked you not to?
  I'm sorry?
That shoulder is severely compromised. I told you I had to get her into theatre.
When we found out she'd been in a car crash, I thought it necessary to rule out a cranial bleed first.
  She showed symptoms, she needed surgery.
  She's been delayed by a couple of minutes.
Not if we miss that slot!
For God's sake, we're not detectives.
Will you please just let me do my job?
And would you please try and think outside the box for a change?
What's the point when you've so clearly got it covered?
  Jac said that you changed the rota?
  No.
  You're not down to Andy's op.
  It's fine. It doesn't matter who does what!
  Actually, it does, because he won't sign.
He says he wants you to do the op and that he's prepared to wait.
What's going on, Greg?
Nothing. Nothing's going on!
Look, can't you see? He's just...playing you.
Just playing the victim.
  Don't you think you're being a bit harsh?
  He's a ligger! A user!
Always has been. Always will be. He can hold out as long as he wants. I'm not going near him.
Good.
Nice tension.
Sam Wardle's test results.
Huh.
Samuel!
So I have good news. Your head CT has come back clear.
Uh huh. So I can go?
Well, it seems not. Turns out we found something else.
I don't understand what.
  From the...accident?
  Unlikely given that it's a 9mm kidney stone.
  But I...?
  It's possible to be asymptomatic in these cases.
Although, believe me, if it had passed through the ureter you'd know about it. So, Dr Hutchison...
blood tests reveal no underlying risks, what would you recommend?
  Surgery.
  Surgery?
  Exactly.
  Just to throw it out there, it could be managed with drugs.
  Yes, that is an option, Mr Levy,
but given the size of it, I'd rather not risk it passing.
  Lulu, how would you like to join me in theatre? First nephrolithotomy?
  SHE's going to do it?
  Course not!
She's going to watch.
Michael, I...
What now, Mr Levy?
It's fine.
He wouldn't actually consider letting her get hands on, would he?
Maybe if he knew who she was.
Seems to me, he's pretty keen to hang himself whoever she is.
Three weeks ago.
In Dublin.
I thought...
..you might want to know.
Why?
Why would I want to know that?
Why could that possibly be of any interest to me?
  Eh?
What are you doing here, Andy?
I'm sick, Cal. I need help.
You could've gone anywhere.
You could've stayed put.
What do you want from me?
Answers.
Please.
I need answers.
Nothing!
Do you understand me?
We have NOTHING to say to one another.
I need some help in here!
  Any news?
  Theatre's still busy.
I'm sorry.
I just wish you could let me do my thing. Let go a little.
  I thought it was for the best.
  Did you?
  What d'you mean?
Just that I think maybe you might be allowing other matters
  to cloud your judgement slightly.
  Are you calling me unprofessional?
Of course not! You're just clearly not comfortable with me
  taking the reins.
  What does that mean?
  Well, most things do tend to be on your terms, Chrissie.
  That's not true!
Maybe I don't like being kept completely in the dark every time about things that are
  personal to me.
  I was trying to do something thoughtful.
I know and that's lovely, but come on...
booking me time off with my boss? Arranging childcare for my son?
  I would never assume that I could book you two days off work without telling you.
  That's different.
  Is it?
  Oh, c'mon, don't give me that look. You know it is.
We have different jobs.
Look, it's clearly not the day for us. I'll cancel the hotel.
We can rearrange or...
whatever.
Look...
..I don't know what's gone on with you two in the past.
But this patient's dying.
Andy's going to die if we don't do something.
He was bad news.
Used to lie all the time.
Borrow money, never pay it back.
We all got sick of it.
The lot of us.
Then one day I caught him stealing...
..from his mam.
They were nice people so I told.
When he found out...
..he kicked the living hell out of me.
We were 14.
I was in hospital for two weeks.
That's the man you want me to save.
Because that's what you do.
It's up to you.
But whatever happened then, you're a surgeon now.
And you're the only one he'll accept.
I'm so sorry to mess you about like this. KNOCK AT DOOR
Clarice Parker. Head CT.
Listen, Sacha, I have to go.
But thank you.
So...you going to tell him it's clear or am I?
I'll do it.
Nurse Williams! I wondered if I might have a word?
Just give me five minutes, please?
Imagine. Injuring your own student...
A child, virtually.
Someone you're responsible for.
In loco parentis' so to speak.
All right, Sacha, what am I missing?
Michael! Mr Spence.
I think there's something you should know.
How does it feel? Any pain?
  OK, how about now?
  Pssst!
OK, bear with me one second.
Quick, close the thing.
I lied!
About the accident. I lied.
I'd...had a bit of...
You know.
Major essay deadline...
wondering what to do...
when this car pulls out up ahead of me...
  swerving all over the place...
  Sam, the thing is, this stone they've found...
well, it's potentially very serious.
I mean all sorts of possible complications.
  OK, then I want the drugs! The ones the other bloke mentioned.
  Sam. Mr Levy...
Well, no offence, but he's only a registrar.
Mr Spence is the superior doctor by far. If he recommends surgery,
then that's what you should opt for. Otherwise...
So if I were you...
I'd sit tight.
Oh, c'mon, stop looking so worried! I appreciate the heads up, I do,
but there is no way I'm going to jeopardise my career or the innocence of an F1,
no matter whose daughter she is or isn't. Seriously.
Right.
We are trying to organise a new theatre slot for you as soon as possible.
Bad day?
Happens to the best of us.
I should never have got in the car.
Not in that state.
Rage.
  About what?
  I was up for interview today.
For a professorship. Mr Beadle, in his wisdom, decided I was not up to the job. He was going to tell them.
Why?
Fear.
Men are threatened by the strangest things, don't you think?
How is the young student?
  All right. As far as I'm aware.
  I don't remember anything.
What's going to happen to me?
I don't know. It depends what he decides to do.
I'm sorry.
I knew you'd come back. You always did.
Comeback King, eh?
D'you remember that...speech you always used to give...
about drive?
14 years old and giving pep talks.
I always thought it was your da' talking.
  Or...
  I'll do it.
Thank you.
The op.
And then that's it.
Thank you. For letting me assist.
  Thought he might be going to bail there for a second.
  Who, Sam?
Take the drugs option after all.
But all it took was some gentle persuasion...
  Very nice.
  It's a gift.
  From a colleague.
  I'm guessing not Mr Levy.
No. From Sunil, my partner up on Plastics.
Wow. Must be pretty lucrative.
Plastics.
It gets a bad press but it's serious stuff.
Oh...
I'm sure it is.
You know what? I think we need to talk to our patient.
  You're the last person I should be talking to.
  I think I'll cope.
I've been an idiot.
Shome mishtake surely?
I thought I could just let it happen, you know, take it as it comes.
But he's right. I can't let anything just happen.
Ten years I've been here.
Ten years of having my life scrutinised, analysed, gossiped about...
And what if this isn't right either?
What if he's not the one?
I don't think I can go through it again.
I think you'll find you probably can.
I've yet to see you give up on anything.
I'm tired. I'm just so tired.
Chrissie...we've had our moments.
But I can genuinely say there is no one I'd rather see happy.
Whoever it's with.
So if you think there's a chance of that...
I would suggest you do more than just dip your big toe in the water.
Or else.
  I'm scared.
  That's normal.
  Everyone's scared here most of the time.
  No, I...
  All set?
  Yeah.
You mean...you didn't?
No...the alternative can be just as effective.
My colleague will explain.
Is this how it works up on Plastics?
If a patient expresses a preference for a particular course of treatment,
then we are obliged to comply with his or her wishes.
Coercion, of any kind, is not an option.
Sorry, Lulu. That's just the way it is.
Too schmaltzy to say you're doing the right thing?
Definitely.
What's that doing here?
Oh. Talisman.
Thought he could do with all the help he can get.
Greg?
Yeah. I want that out of here.
They took her off to theatre about half an hour ago.
Nurse Williams... I really do need to talk to you.
It's quite urgent.
Are you OK to do this?
Let's just get on with it, shall we?
So...have you sorted out your differences yet?
I don't know what she wants.
Maybe she just wants to trust you know what you want.
OK...you seem to have everything covered here, so if you'll excuse me.
It's her heart.
  What?
  Clarice has a heart condition.
She's had it for the last couple of years. Symptoms   dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath
and regular blackouts.
Hence the car crash.
Probably.
She's refused to see anyone about it.
Looks like we've had a lucky escape.
We need to get her closed up as quickly as possible.
Thank you, Sister Williams.
Damn it...she's going into SVT!
Heart rate's rising.
She's going into VF.
Paddles!
Charging...
and clear!
And again. Charging...
We need someone from Darwin! NOW!

  Hi, Chrissie.
Yes, he's here.
Ok, well, I'll come down.
  Damn it!

Chrissie, I'm going to have to hang up.
Greg!
OK, knife.
  Dan!
  Please. For once. Could you just trust me?
If you can't get on board, I suggest you leave.
We need to find the source of the bleed! We're losing him!
Greg!
Nicked the mammary artery taking the graft.
OK, where are ya?
OK, there you are. Ligger clip.
  It's not holding!
  Greg, I'm gonna have to take over.
I need you to step aside, OK? Step aside.
Come on.
Right, more suction.
Don't move.
OK, where are you?
Where are you?
Gotcha.
I need you to stop the ventilator for a moment.
4 0 prolene.
The damage seems pretty extensive.
They said something's happened.
Clarice went into cardiac arrest during the operation.
There was no one from Cardiology available.
She'll be all right, won't she?
Why didn't you tell us earlier?
She was going to...cut all contact. That's what she said.
If I mentioned it to anyone, we'd never speak again.
She's the most pig headed, opinionated, cantankerous, foul tongued woman I have ever met.
I've loved her since the moment I set eyes on her.
Please...
don't let anything happen to her.
100% oxygen and adrenalin.
  I'm losing her.
  Just take your time.
  I can't put enough pressure on the heart.
  You can do it.
I need more room between the intercostal space.
I can feel the left ventricle.
Well, if it isn't Doctor Death himself.
Hey Mischa, this is the old guy I was telling you about.
The one I'd be suing if he hadn't put in a good word for me with the rozzers.
Have it. You might learn something.
Oh, hey Sam, just out of curiosity...
what was your objection to surgery?
You lot are all the same. Plough on in there, guns blazing, thinking you're God Almighty, stuff it up.
Then change your mind and decide you want out after all. Why would I sign up for that?
All right, Sam, it was good to meet you. I hope your day improves.
Oh, it will.
Believe me.
Hey, Sam! Those drugs we gave you? You should probably take a look at the pamphlet.
Under rare side effects? I'd hate for anything to detract from your night's enjoyment.
OK, everyone, I am needed urgently on Plastics.
But I'll see you all tomorrow.
  Am I fixed, Doc?
  More or less. Few hitches, but you pulled through.
Where is he?
I want to thank him.
I'm sorry.
It's what I expected.
Look, the past isn't going to disappear just because it suits you.
The past?
What you did to him, the fight, it took him a long time to recover.
That's what he told you?
We were kids. He survived, didn't he?
These came for you. Some hospital north of Manchester. Apparently you requested them.
Poor sod must've spent half his life in hospital.
'You see, the thing is, a fella can be great on paper,
'tick all the boxes. But once you get him out on the field, it becomes something different.
'Then it becomes about heart, about drive,
'about determining your own destiny.'
Call a crash team! Ambi bag!
Page Mr Douglas!
Outside the box. You were right.
If you'd walked away like I said you should, she'd be dead.
Thank you.
For trusting me.
Having Daniel is the first time in my life I feel I've got something solid,
something real.
Like I'm running the show for once.
  I'm...
  Determining your own destiny.
You were right, what you said about me.
It's true.
But I don't know if I can do anything about it.
Your lucky day.
You lied.
What did you tell her?
I told her you put me in hospital.
It was supposed to be me, wasn't it...
the star of the show?
The big bucks.
Cal...
..what happened...
..I can't...
It won't go.
It won't leave me.
It's always there...in my head.
I can't shake it.
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't you?
Don't you?
I'm sorry.
Greg.
Mates?
I saw Pale kings and princes too Pale warriors, death pale were they all
Who cried, "La Belle Dame sans Merci
"Thee hath in thrall!"
I hope you're not intending to bore me with that twaddle for the rest of the night.
Of course not, my dear. I wouldn't dream of it.
I saw their starved lips in the gloam
With horrid warning gaped wide
And I awoke and found me here.
You cancelled then?
Couldn't organise an omelette in a hen house.
Not to worry. It's only money.
I can't believe you got Chantelle to help you pack.
Chantelle? Please. I know I messed up but give me some credit!
You didn't mess up.
Been making notes for weeks.
I'm not going anywhere, you know.
I get it wrong sometimes because...
Well, I've never felt like this about anyone else.
But I'm in it for the long haul.
Have you still got those train tickets?
It'd better not be full of lacy underwear.
Give me five minutes?
Hey, you might want to call Sacha.
  All right?
  Yeah.
  Drink?
  No.
Thanks.
I think I'm going to head home.
  What's this?
  It's an X ray of Andy's collar bone when he was 14.
Remember? When he got beaten up and spent two weeks in hospital?
I have to go.
Why did you lie to me?
Because I want you off my back.
Can you not get that?
I want both of yous off my back!
Wow!
Shall we?
  No!
  Oh, yes!
Ya ta ta, ta da da...
