Hello and welcome to Wednesday's It Takes Two. I have three fine
couples. They have their chins up and they got happy at the weekend,
Kimberley and Pasha are here. I will be doing a bit of jive with my
next couple, Lisa and Robin. They are not in Kansas, no, they
are in Shepherd's Bush. Vincent and Dani are here. As the winter nights
get darker and draw closer, what do we need more than a man to warm us
up, he is here, it is Ian Waite. This is It Takes Two. Please
welcome Zoe Ball.
That's it. Is that that it? It is really bad. Hello and welcome to It
Takes Two. It is Hallowe'en week and we get a look at what ghoulish
surprises we can expect from our couples. Hoping their performances
are a killer. Here is a recap of Beauty, glamour, light, lovely, you
really captured the spirit of the song. Wonderful.
Kimberley, great attack. Beautiful light steps always such a pleasure
to watch. I liked it a lot. It is such an
improvement. Well done. Seven.
Seven. Eight. Yes! Good news.
I have got further to go, but we have improved. On wards and upwards.
Please welcome Kimberley and Pasha.
Congratulations on 29 on Saturday. Top score. You must have been
chuffed to bits? Yes, we were really happy that we got our
highest score. Highest score yet? Yes. Right up to
40. What a difference a week makes because last week, a nightmare for
you, not even that bad as far as we were concerned, but this week it
was so much better. What changed in a week? I think I really wanted to
go out there and enjoy it on Saturday night. That was the main
aim in my head and I think I did that. There is still things that we
can work on, but we had fun, didn't we? The secret is to make her smile.
Make her smile a lot. As long as you smile, it is fine.
That dance and the music, it lent itself to that. When you are doing
something serious and you have got to be aggressive and Mr Len
Goodman's comments firm, but fair. How important was it to really
impress him this weekend? It was important to me that I could
obviously prove that I tried and that we had, you know, we improved
and he said that we had so that is good.
How pleased with Kimberley? She was amazing. It is the beginning of the
journey. Could you say beginning again.
Beginning of the journey. Bruno gave you an eight, he said,
bruty, glamour and light. Did you do celebratory star jumps? That was
our first eight. We were excited. Last week, you were busy with your
day job. How is juggling Girls Aye Aloud and Strictly going? Both
things are fun and I'm getting on with it and hoping for the best.
I am hoping you will get confused and Pasha will appear instead of
Nicola. Have you thought any of the girls
the moves? Cheryl used to help me because she used to do ballroom as
a child. She says, "This one has to be like this and that one has to be
like that.". We don't doubt your singing. We know you are very good,
but you are a human beat box. Look Aye.
Zzzzz. Dumb. Ay yo yo. It is so good.
It was great.
This week, Hallowe'en. You have got a bit of a theme. We do, yeah.
We have got a bit of character acting going on this week.
Who will you be? I will be Little Red Riding Hood. Who is he?
Grandma? I think we are going to go with something wolfish.
Is he scary as a wolf?
OK, you may need to work on that a bit? He is not really scary.
It is the paso doble. How are you finding that? Well, when we are not
laughing, it is coming along well. It is all about character.
As soon as he starts trying to be the scary wolf, I start laughing.
Are you going to have big teeth?
Are they going to give you fury ear as soon as. We are We are working
on it, but I started growing hair here. They said in a full moon or
hair. Hairy knuckles as well. It will be great. Give it up for
Kimberley and Pasha.
It is time now to fin out how our seb our celebrities are are coping
with the demands of Hallowe'en week. One man can tell us, yes, it is Ian
Waite time! Please welcome the handsome Ian Ian
Waite. Look at you in your fancy white
shoes. I was going to wear black. First, Hollywood week and now
Hallowe'en week, we are being spoilt? It is one of my favourite
weeks. And the dressing up. Yes.
We are going to look at the girls this week. Coming from her lovely
Mary Poppins performance, American smooth. Is this going to be
romantic? It is a short clip and all we see is some pivots. I am
going to use my graphics, my wonderful graphics. One, two, three,
four. Four points. Four points. First of all, point
one, lovely hands. She is finishing off her hands. Good point. Number
two, she has a lovely poise lifting up her chin and nose in the air.
Good centre. She has a a strong core and point four, she is
pointing her foot. It is all good for Fern.
In a standing position anyway. Denise and James are doing the cha 
cha cha. Another Latin, I imagine she will be great? James has given
her difficult choreography. Very fast footwork. I have stopped it
here to show you, this is difficult to show, but during that dance, she
is not straightening her legs all the time. I would like to see her
get her heels down on to the floor which will help her snap her legs
which will help her snap her legs back. She needs to straighten her
knees. Can you just do that again. Look at
that, ladies and gentlemen. That is dance brilliance. Robin is looking
unimpressed. It is going to be difficult.
Victoria and Brendan are doing the tango. Is Victoria take to go it   
taking to it like a duck to water? There is difficult choreography.
The professionals are stepping it up this week. What I wanted to
point out was this section here, look at that. Look at that space
between them. The only problem with giving more difficult choreography
to the celeb celebrities is that you you start, problems start to
occur like gapping. I am going to put that here. You are getting
carried away. We need a few less of those, thank you very much.
They can work on that. Let's move on to Kimberley and Pasha. What are
the points in a paso doble? A lot of shaping. There is this bull
fight story that has to go on and there is a lot of flamenco. I have
slowed this down because they have fantastic transitions because Pasha
is clever with the use of arms. She turns away and look at the attitude
and he looks frightened. I don't know what that is. I have no idea
what that is. Look at you. It looks like it could be a good
dance for Kimberley. Lisa and Robin are are doing the
Charleston. Are we liking this, Ian? I am liking this dance. They
have got typical, humorous Charleston steps which are great.
This is going to be a splen dus, slapstick, show dance, all the Ss!
Dani and Vincent are doing the cha  cha cha as well. How is this
looking? Again, it is quite fast this dance. A lot of content in
there. But what I wanted to point out was her lovely close. In places
it is neat and tidy. She just needs to be faster on the foot.
It is looking good. We will discuss the boys later on. Him and his big
white shoes, it is Ian Waite.
A good night on Saturday night for all three of our guests with all
coming joint third in the leaderboard. Here is a reminder of
Dani and Vincent's foxtrot. You did it so beautifully.
Flawlessly moving. Sweet, I really, really loved it.
I loved the routine. I thought you did a wonderful job, vintant Corry
      Vincent choreographing that. There was control in your gliding,
it was smooth. Take those red shoes and walk down
that Yellow Brick Road straight into next week because that was
great. Seven. Six.
Eight. Eight. I am over the rainbow!
magic slippers worked. They did work!
They did work! Please welcome Dani and Vincent.
Congratulations on another super,
smashing, great performance on Saturday. It was so romantic.
Everybody loved it. Did you love it? I loved it. The Wizard of Oz is
my favourite film. I loved playing Dorothy and the little dog, Betty.
Are there teeth marks in your arm, Vincent? He looked like me a little
bit. A little brother from a different mother!
Vincent third on the leaderboard for the third week running. Are you
pleased? Two little sausages moving around the floor. We did so well
and she made me so proud. It was a complicated routine, but it was so
effortless and and beautiful. Beautiful.
And also a rare thing for a professional to get singled out by
the judges. Craig usedted word word "brilliant." Have you gone home and
rewound that and rewound it? I have. To get a reward from one of the
judges, especially from him, it is good.
Online, a lot of people were disappointed that Darcey only gave
you a six. One viewer said, "Six seems low. I would have said seven.
." Does that make you miffed? not really. Her comments are really,
really good and six is a good mark for the third week, isn't it? We
don't mind. Maybe next week, she will give us a seven and that would
be great. Noted. How much Did the magic ruby
slippers, his gift, help you? other shoes were killing my feet.
They really were slippers. Vincent was struggling with them a
bit last week. My little Dorothy, I have got
some... What have you got? Magic ruby shoes.
My little Dorothy, I have got some magic...
I think this magic ruby slippers. I bought her some magic ruby...
These magic ruby slippers. These magic ruby slippers. Why can't I
say? Some magic ruby...
Magic ruby shoes are going to help your dancing, yes.
Slippers. Some magic ruby slippers.
I think this magic ruby... I think, you know, you know what I
think... I think these magic ruby slippers are going to help my
dancing. Can you use that?
Can you say it now? No, magic ruby slippers.
You did it! In your face.
There is a lot of fascination with your tattoos, Dani. Can you stand
up and show us. Can you talk us through it? Leg up, lovely.
This Is a fairy. Can we see it? How old were you when you got that?
was 18. Is there a legal age for tattoos? The other one is like a
bow. Have you got any Vincent?, I have
got one made in Italy in my mind, but I will have to do it on my
little body. This week, OK, Holly, it is a
Hallowe'en theme and you have got a theme. What are you going to be
doing? We are dance to go Scooby  Doo.
Oh wow. Who are you going to be playing? Well, we're still thinking
about it, but I think I might be Thelma.
Not Not Elma. Are you going to be Shaggy? I might
It is the cha cha cha. How are you finding it? Hopefully by Saturday
it will work nicely. It is speedy? It is really, really
fast. Good luck. Dani and Vincent.
Time now to check out the boys. It
is the second dose of Waite's It is non stop, Ian is back. Thank
goodness. We are going to start off with Sid tonne because sadly Ola's
mum has taken ill and we send lots of love to Ola. We have not much
footage of Sid training. We will talk to him tomorrow about his cha 
cha cha. Michael and Natalie did the cha cha cha on Saturday, did
you enjoy it? It was better than the jive. He He loves his ballroom,
Vaughany. A massive improve: They have done the most hours. His hold
is really good in most places. The only thing I wanted to point out
was he does lift his shoulder as you can see and he needs to keep it
flat and he also needs to keep it back. Can you demonstrate for us?
Don't bring it forward like that. Cool. It is a common fault in most
beginner dancers, but it is a difficult thing to do.
Colin and Kristina. They are doing the salsa. I imagine this might be
scorchio. I wanted to point out, I am loving the fact, he is using his
his hips really well. I wanted to point out his facial expressions.
Look at that face. Come on Col! Is this a good thing? Or will it be
something Craig will pick up on? prefer a sexy, smouldering look
rather than a wincing look. would we rather see Colin's face?
Maybe a mixture of the two. Thanks very much!
Did you like the salsa? He has more to show. He needs to bring out the
personality more. I am liking the tango. He has strong arms. He is a
gymnast. I would like to see him a bit more compact. Remember our
tango? How could I forget. More compact and keep it contained.
OK. I have missed you. Do it again. Knees are down. Thank
you very much. Can I just stay there? That was good.
Nicky and Karen will also tango. is looking better. I am pleased
with the beginning of this. But it is basic, but he looks good. The
problem with Nicky, as soon as he starts rotating, he is turning his
head iwards. Where should his head be? Straight
most of the time unless he is in promenade position. He needs to
lower in the knees and he needs to... Last week, he was lower in
the knees and that could be good here. Also, the top, if I can draw
it, he needs it maintain the shape all the way through and we will
give them these. Ah, that's beautiful. Hopefully we
will create a a spell to make Nicky dance much better.
Richard and Erin will paso doble. At times good and at times
mechanical. I would like to see him be more consistent and more shaping
here. I would like to see him creating shaping. Create the
shaping all the time. Always this big circular shape in paso doble.
Oh, look at that. A bit of flamenco.
Could you give them some flamenco lessons? Three three years I have
done flamenco. It is like this. It is a bit like ballet, but a lot of
curved arms and clicking cas tonne castonets.
It is a treat to see you. Give it up for Ian Waite.
I don't care what the others say, I
like your shoes! Saturday saw hanky panky on the dance floor as
Lisa and Robin treated us to a good jive. Here is a reminder of what
jive. Here is a reminder of what happened.
I I get very excited watching you darling. I can't tell you, you
really sell a number. Brilliant. Vibrancy, vitality, light on your
feet. You give a good time no matter what!
There were plenty of hanky panky going on, but I have got to say,
you are a goer! It was missing the spring and the
bounce in that jive, but still I really loved that performance.
Six. Seven.
Eight. Craig
Craig has
Craig has been
Craig has been so
Craig has been so kind to us. not not being kind, he is just
saying what he sees. Please welcome, the artists   Lisa
Please welcome, the artists   Lisa and Robin.
Is this the new little look you have got going on here? I am a geek.
The hole week I am not to take these off.
They are meant to be no glass in there, Robin? I am not allowed to
take them off all week. I don't understand why, but I'm going with
Good work, team. We just see your reactions when you were coming out
of the studio there. Did you love it, Lisa? I really, really did and
the whole Hollywood thing being an actor, it was like let's go to
Hollywood. I really enjoyed the routine. It was fun and fast. Yeah,
I got a lovely hair style. Two and a quarter hours to create that
little monster! What did you do during that time?
Talked a lot. Bruno said it had vibrancy and vitality. Craig said
brilliant. Does it surprise you when the judges come up with such
compliments? Craig has blown me away. I want to take him to the pub
and say thank you. He would be well up for that? He is really kind.
That's really good because that makes you drive on and you want to
do well and Bruno is just gorgeous, isn't he? What about the other two?
Len is correct. He keeps, you know,
he has a technique and he took that on board and I want to get the
footwork right. I am not here for a laugh, I want to nail the steps as
well. Darcey gave you a six for a second
week and said it lacked spring and bounce. Did you think that was a
fair comment, Robin? Watching it back, there was, there there could
have been more bounce action within the jive. I was more proud of that
Lisa sold it 150% and that was more important on that night and week by
week, the technique will get better, but it won't happen overnight.
They are growing on me, the glasses actually. I almost forgot who you
were for a minute. In the dress rehearsal, you had a woopsy moment?
Yeah. Thank goodness it didn't happen on the night. The leap frog
frog where Robin Robin goes over my head, I forgot to bow my head.
Nasty? Yes. I was in a lot of pain. The crown
jewels weren't feeling too good for a while.
You should wear a box to protect you. It might not be great for
Lisa's head. Last week, you were saying it would be difficult to top
the choreography of your cha cha  cha. Did you manage it? Were you
happy? It went down well. It was come complicated than the cha cha.
This week, however, we have gone one step further.
You have gone one step further. First of all, you like Dani, Lisa
have been saying your shoes have been hurting you a little bit?
Robin had no sympathy? No sympathy. It has changed.
Meet her in the middle. Look at this little VT.
Right, if I could could trade my feet with you for like 30 minutes,
you might have more sympathy. I can do it with heels on.
Fine, I will show you how to do it in heels.
One, two, three, four, five, six, One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six...
I am very impressed, I must say. Point proved.
You may have worn ladies shoes
before, Robin.. Do tell. Do tell. I am giving Kristina a run for her
money. Has it made you think twice about
complaining?. It falls on deaf ears every time I complain. I have got
flatter shoes. It hasn't gone unnoticed that you
might have a crush on Robin? What? Never.
He is quite cute. Hello. He is amazing. We have got a little gift
for you. We have had this made up. This has taken a lot of labour. It
is your very own Robin Windsor calendar. It is pretty special.
Some of the pages are a little sticky. August, that's when your
birthday is, isn't it? Yes. That's your birthday shot. I love T
thank you. What's your next dance. You are
doing the Charleston this week? You love it? When I got offered
Strictly, I said, "I just want to get to Charleston week." It is
loads of fun. That's what we like doing and it is another quick one
again. They are getting quicker and
quicker, Robin. It seems to fall like that and
there was nothing quicker than this, whatever happens, if we go another
week, it will be slower. There is nowhere else to go.
There is There is no petrol left. Good luck this weekend!
That's it for today. Thank you to all my guests. Tomorrow Nicky and
