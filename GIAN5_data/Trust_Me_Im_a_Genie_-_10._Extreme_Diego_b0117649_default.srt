Three wishes set me free
Trust me I'm a genie
Wish one
And on that first day I got my very own cafe.
Ta da!
Wish two
That was cool I got me own swimming pool
Hee hee!
But then I dropped the magic can
And it filled with sand
And the words got jammed
Wish three
A total catastrophe
The genie raved and ranted
But no third wish was granted
If one more wish comes true Then I'll be free from you
Trust me I'm a genie.
Woah! Woah!
Ha ha, yeah!
  Look!
  Cool moves, Diego.
Ha ha! Give yourself a round of applause.
Newsflash!
Here in Oasis, excitement is mounting
as nominations pour in for Extreme Sports Champion.
Top movie star, Rita Van Hump, who are you backing for the title?
Why, who else but Sam Sahara?
Oh, ho!
Whe e e!
Woo hoo!
He's a real daredevil, and the handsomest man in Oasis Wood.
But you're handsome too, scoopy woopy. Mwah!
So, Rita's backing Sam Sahara.
But it's not too late to send your vote
for your favourite extreme sports champion.
Sam Sahara, Sam Sahara, na na na! What's so special about him?
Exactly. All he's got is wealth, fame and good looks.
It sure would be good if someone else won for a change.
I wonder who that could be, though?
Yeah, who?
You dumb hump!
I can hear the crowds cheering you now
as you step up to take the award.
Grarrgh! Grrr!
Woo hoo!
Woo hoo!
Mwah!
  That's it. I wish to be extreme sports champion.
  Yeah!
I call upon the powers that be to grant this wish and set me free.
A camcorder? How's that going to help?
Diego, ain't ya heard of the Internet?
All we got to do is video you doing extreme sports,
then post them on CamelTube.
Thing is, what are you good at?
Gulp!
Hey, well... lots of things. I mean, I can...
  Eh...
  Got it!
I've got it! Cool moves with a tray. You can do extreme waitering.
Are you sure these wings you made are going to work?
Of course. Just until you're over the pool.
Should be spectacular. Hee hee hee!
Wa a ah!
A a ah!
Hey, they really do work.
Oh!
Ooh, Oh! Woah!
That's cool, Diego. Keep going.
Woah!
Arrgh!
Uncool, man.
Diego, are you OK?
Right as rain, thanks.
This is weird.
You should be in little pieces
and so should this.
But before, the camera was running.
Here, drop this when I tell you.
Woah!
It's a magic camcorder.
It makes whatever you film indestructible.
  So, how does that help?
  How?
Because now you can try something dangerous.
Yeah!
Yeah, I want a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese.
Take one, extreme tightrope walking. And action!
Oh, promise these are vegetarian piranhas?
Course they are.
Trust me, I'm a genie.
Woah!
Wa a ah!
Arrrgh!
A a a ah!
Pretty extreme,
but not extreme enough.
Take one, extreme video gaming. And action!
Go!
Arrgh!
Wa a ah! Arrgh!
Woah!
A a a argh!
Wa a ah!
Nice try. I'd say we're getting there.
Take one, extreme rock dancing. And action.
Pizza! It's for Larry.
Woah! Waaargh!
Arrgh!
It's amazing. Thanks to the camera.
Ha ha! Hm, not bad.
Let's take a look at the footage.
Look at that, will you? The wish is in the bag.
I'm here in Oasis,
Sam Sahara is thrilling the crowd with some even more amazing stunts.
This is unbelievable.
Sam's wind walking thousands of feet in the air while juggling of awards.
And wait! Can it be? Is he...?
Ladies and gentlemen, I wasn't expecting this
so I don't have anything prepared.
Yes, he is! Sam Sahara is rehearsing his acceptance speech!
Looks to me like we've got to up our game.
Get ready for the most spectacular extreme sport of all time.
Extreme Ming vase juggling.
Ride the rocket powered quad bike, juggle the priceless Ming vases,
jump across the ravine and parachute down with the umbrella.
You're invisible when the camera is on you.
Any problems, I'll be on the radio.
Oh, Diego! The batteries have run out!
You're no longer indestructible!
Aaarrgh!
  Larry! Do something!
  Huh?
Hang in there, Diego!
Wah! Woah! Wa a ah!
Aaarrgh!
Er, you did upload all the other footage we got, right?
Wa a ah!
Hi, guys. Hey, that was a great stunt, Diego.
I got it all on my camcorder too.
Yay!
Ladies and gentlemen,
We have a winner for extreme sports champion.
Just check out this fantastic footage.
Well, it's been great, old pal.
Your wish has been granted. Now, I'm out of here.
Yes, in a dramatic, last minute upset,
favourite Sam Sahara has been beaten.
By a new extreme sport star, the winner of Extreme Sports Champion is
Larry!
For his fantastic demonstration of a whole new sport,
extreme pizza eating.
Hey, cool.
Wa a ah!
No o o!
Diego?
Are you OK? You've been up there for ages.
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm practising for next year's Extreme Sports Champion.
Really? Which category are you going in for?
Extreme TV watching.
