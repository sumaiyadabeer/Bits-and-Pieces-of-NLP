the so called Old an experiment has On Newsnight Scotland, Alex Allan
says the SNP want to use renewable energy to reindustrialise Scotland.
The major parties are mad keen on renewables. But are they making a
terrible mistake? Also tonight, is there anything politicians can do
for communities left high and dry as the tides of heavy industry
recede? We will be reporting from deepest Ayrshire.
Good evening. Even if you take the most optimistic view of today's GDP
figures, there is little doubt the economy could do with an extra lift.
The SNP think it is renewables. They talk about reindustrialise in
well. But the idea is contentious in industry and is needing to an
increasingly heated debate. An economy now back in the recovery,
or stagnant for the last six months? Does the Prime Minister
think it is a mark of success or failure that the economy has flat
lined over six months? It is clearly a success that the economy
is growing! First quarter figures for the UK economy show growth of
0.5%, compared to a contraction of the same amount in the previous
quarter. In terms of year on year growth, it amounts to 1.8% of GDP.
It means the underlying growth is broadly flat, according to the
Independent Office for National Statistics. It also means the
figures are very open to interpretation. Ed Miliband!
Speaker, what world is he living in? What extraordinary complacency!
Isn't it the case that it is his cats that are too far, too fast?
That they are holding back growth in the economy? He said, and the
shadow chancellor said, there would be a double dip recession. They had
find it in themselves to welcome the growth in the economy? At the
same time, his coalition partner, Vince Cable, told the Commons
Business Committee that bank lending to small businesses, a
major drive of the economy, was still alarmingly low. It is one of
the most difficult. The figures from the Bank of England last week
showed very disappointing and negative lending. It is clearly
very disappointing indeed. I wouldn't try to pretend anything
else. The UK construction industry says it is suffering badly from the
downturn. Projects like the M74 extension are especially welcome.
Alex Salmond says that George Osborne should take a leaf out of
his book. Get some capital investment into the economy. Get
the construction sector moving. That is what we have been trying to
do in Scotland. I'd strongly advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
follow that course across the UK as a whole. You can't get an economic
revival it you have a depression in your construction sector. All of
the Scottish parties are emphasising the importance of jobs.
The SNP in particular is claiming it is possible to use renewables at
sea and on land to reindustrialise Scotland. At the same time, while
all of the main parties are aware that green energy has huge
potential, they question the viability of the nationalist aim of
having 100% of Scottish electricity generated by renewables by 2020. 80
today spilled over into the letter pages of the Scotsman.
I am joined by two signatories of the letters. Donald Miller has
spent a lifetime in power companies. David Maxwell is the managing
director of Steel Engineering. It makes steel for renewable
industries. Donald Miller, what do you think is wrong with this idea
of seeing renewables as basically the next big industry for Scotland?
Well, the letter which I signed to the press yesterday reflects the
growing concern of many professional engineers in Scotland
about the excessive amounts of renewables which the Government is
proposing. We are not against renewables, per se. But we think,
and we have good reason to believe that, that the hundred % target or
even 80% target is quite unrealistic. It is impractical. The
costs would be extremely damaging. Not many people realise that
electricity customers are already paying a hidden subsidy in their
electricity bills for nuclear electricity. In effect, that
doubles the price of renewable electricity, directly, in the
hidden subsidy. In addition, there are other costs involving the back 
up generation for when the wind does not blow and also the huge
costs on transmission. Just on that, as I understand it, nobody is
suggesting that when they say all Scotland's demand should be met by
renewables, nobody is suggesting, as I understand it, that they
should not be coal fired power stations, gas power, nuclear, as
exist at the moment. It's simply that the renewable generated would
be equivalent for Scotland's demand, and Scotland would export power. So
that they slowed problem will not be a problem? That is true. The
Government have belatedly realised that they do need some back up.
They are proposing something like 200,000 megawatts of back up
generation. But that is another question. They are relying on
carbon capture and storage, huge quantities. This is an unproven
technology. The costs are uncertain. They will certainly be higher. To
plan on that, for a Scottish service like electricity, we think
it is imprudent and folly. You were involved in this. Making renewables.
The cost is something that is not talked about an awful lot. I
presume that renewable generation is only viable at the moment
because the British government puts a renewable obligation on the
electricity companies, they have to buy some of this stuff? It is more
We manufacture for both the oil and gas and renewables. The
manufacturing costs are the same. I you suggesting that if it is
scaled up, for example Elita city coming from of short, which is the
next thing    offshore. That it could be as cheap? I think as
technology improves it will. We are currently making a second version
of all wave machine which is cheaper. We have made design
changes and it isn't    and it is more efficient. We are on to the
next generation of machines. The stench    it is the same in the
North Sea. It is cheaper to extract oil now. This target, is that you
are all? It is very ambitious. I'll concede that. People like Alex
Salmond would say it is good to have ambition. If you only achieve
80%, fair enough. Can I make a point? We are all in favour of
doing these developments and having reasonable amount of wind power up
and so on, but marine energy is going to be very difficult. The
Government have really    recently published a plan about energy in
Scotland going right through to 2030. I think they have taken a
more realistic view here. They are proposing that marine Energy, a
tight and wave, will amount to only 5%. That does not include wind
energy. We can calculate the costs of this very easily. Based on the
Government's plan for 2030, the cost to the consumer and to direct
subsidy alone is 2000,    to hunt up    �2,250 million per animal.
�2,250 million Pat annum. Paid for by consumers in their end at    in
their elegist to bills. In addition, there is back up generation...
get the figures. These costs are astronomical. But David Maxwell's
point is that the more at this scales up, like anything else, the
costs come down. They do not come down. The subsidy is fixed for
decades ahead. There is no real prospect... There will be marginal
improvements but technically, the industry opinion is that these will
be fairly modest. We do not see anything that is going to change
the Big Picture. David Maxwell, I am curious, if Scotland was on its
own, or would any of this work? Does not all costing rely on as
being part of the National Grid and on the UK as a whole being are the
consumers of the renewable energy that can produce? Yes, of course. I
think it has to be on the UK as a whole. We need the UK Government to
get behind this and invest heavily in it. I am coming from a slightly
different perspective. Are we rely on gas from Russia and the Middle
East. Just recently, if anything has proved anything, you have a
little bit of trouble in Libya and oil prices jumped up. This will
continue. It will get more and more prohibitive. We are all for reliant
on their energy at the moment. My view is that I would like my
grandson's to draw up and live in a country that was self sufficient in
energy.    grow up. Government's plan proposes 12,500
megawatts of renewable energy by 2030. That is twice Scotland's
demand. They will need to export huge quantities to England and
still to import huge quantities when the wind does not blow. I have
spent decades exporting. Very profitably too. I know that these
would be distressed sales. And yet we would have to buy at a premium.
That is exactly what has happened in Denmark. Denmark has the highest
wind energy in Europe and has to sell its elegy overseas at an
awkward prices.    its energy. And it has the highest carbon footprint
and the highest energy prices. Last we can I just say, and I have
discussed this with the Confederation of British Industry
in Scotland and they had authorised me to say you tonight that they
have concerns    the concerns I have expressed tally exactly with
their concerns. I can also say that the renewable Energy Foundation
says that    the organisation that is designed to exploit renewable
energy sensibly says that they agree. I think we should do the
same as Tyne and America are doing at the moment. Of the eddying it,
so should be.    Tyne and America. It has called the third Scotland.
Across the country, there are communities that are left high and
dry up by their long gone industrial you have. Our
correspondent has been to Ayrshire to ask what hope they can hold out
New Cumnock has problems. They are far from unique in post industrial
Scotland. Some here have hope. Cumnock is a treasure in a jar of
clay. The treasure is the people. The treasure is the beautiful
countryside. The heritage and history and the potential of the
place. The jar of clay are at the buildings. I am sure you know that
the fields have been gaining on the houses, and that is increasingly so.
The population here has been in decline for years. Hundreds of
houses have been demolished. Leaving roads to nowhere. I used to
do a paper round here in the 1970s and 1980s. As you can see now it
has are rolled with grass on either side, there is nothing here.    I
These when you come up's glory days. It had the Peps and the Test at   
textile industry. When the boys left the school, they just
automatically went to the pits. It was all that is there for them at
that time. When I left school I got a job. I left on the Friday and
started on the Monday. I got the chance at a shop down the road. But
in the factory you were making more money. New Cumnock's industry of
mining and textiles are long gone. This man is a former at label cut  
  councillor. These days he says he is no party affiliation. There is
no single job here. This is how dreadful it is becoming. The people
are leaving for jobs, so there is getting less and less of a
population every year. You feel there is no way out. You are in a
vortex. There used to be well over 9,000 people living in and around
this time. Now the population is approaching a third of that. This
story is nothing new. The story of the Scottish working class is one
of transients. The move to where the workers. Indeed, the only trace
that has left behind his one man's brother's name on this war memorial.
More than 100 men from New Cumnock died in the First World War, but
ultimately it was Pete closures    pit closures which did for this
time. These are problems familiar in many coalfield communities.
would be good if there was something for the younger
generation. I think that is the biggest problem. It is drugs and
alcohol. It is the same all over. Through years ago, came perhaps the
ultimate indignity. The Scottish Government's statisticians took
note of this community's reduce size and downgraded its to a rural
area. The town hall still stands, but it is no longer town. It is
being hollowed out. We feel as if we're being deserted by everyone.
We haven't to a massive co  operative buildings due for
demolition. There is a hotel due for demolition. We that the town
hall which they are going to demolish as well. We are going to
have an awful lot of car parks. A lot of empty spaces. Someone said
it was a one horse town, I said it is a 100 car town and no horses.
This family came to New Cumnock as part of a wave of immigration from
Spain. Now, like so many others, France's Lopez has moved away. All
the has his memories of how it used to beat houses round you. When I
got to the end of my paper round here, there was a row of houses
down there. All the doors would open as if someone had pressed a
button and all the miners would come out. At the same time, there
were six or seven red double decker buses that would take into the mind.
That was just the day shift. You can imagine, you had the night
shift. There were men at all times working in the minds.    in the
Industry is now as much of this town's past as that memories of
Wallace and Bruce. So what Obi its future? Scotland is peppered with
communities like these. They are like a high tide mark that was left
behind be at their    after the Industrial Revolution. What can
politicians offer for communities like these?
Are I am joined now by Andy Milne. And here in Glasgow by Ross Martin.
Ross Martin, let me ask you a pint    blunt question. Do you think
that these communities    that we should be realistically talking
about what can be done to revive these communities? Places like New
Cumnock for example, they are geographically quite isolated.
still have a pattern of settlement across Scotland which was designed
around the industrial revolution. What we need to do is ask the
question of what is the role and the function of these places. What
is this place for? Why is the place which people call home, why does it
exist and does it provide a function for the rest of the Air
Show.    a share. Does link to the community? The mining industry was
an industry which to place in a relatively isolated rural setting.
Because communities are changing, you were talking about the
renewables centre, different for up    different functions and purposes,
at different reasons to accessed emerge as their economy changes.
What is your answer to your own It needs to find its role in
Ayrshire. Ayrshire needs to get its act together. They have three
councils pulling in different directions. If they worked closer
together, they would be able to find how each town relates to each
other and how the main towns relate to smaller places, and how the
smaller places work with that. practical terms, if you are sitting
watching this and you say, I would just like there to be jobs round
here, what is the answer? Gone are the days of begin sternal    big
internal investment. You need to look at the town centre, does
retail exist? Maybe not, maybe you'd do away with that and you
turn it into a dormitory town for work elsewhere. Maybe you turn it
into a tourist town, a specialist town in the way that you seek West
Kilbride has turned itself into a specialist area. Each of these
towns, each of these places, the people in each of these places need
to be encouraged and enabled to drive a future for themselves. If
there is not a future for themselves, they need to get out.
Andy Milne, do you agree with that would do you think that we need to
give up on places like that? Well, I certainly don't think we should
be giving up on places like that. These are places that have built
modern Scotland as it is. The benefits they have always enjoyed
that have gone on in terms of work in these places. But Ross Martin's
point is that, if you like, you could take the moral reasons for
supporting people that live there, and of course it is true that they
were part of the Scottish Industrial Revolution, but that is
long gone. Ross Martens' point was that there is no particular logic
to these types of towns and villages being where they are in
the 21st century. There is a logic for the people there. People have
affection for the place, identity with the place. I think it was
interesting in the film that there is reference to Co Op buildings,
for instance. Their opportunities across Scotland and in communities
like that for new enterprises to flourish among people living there
who still have a sense of identity with the place, its engine of
affliction.    a sense of affection. I certainly take the point of the
importance of having a strategic plan across the area. For people
that want to remain in the areas where their roots are, it's
important for people. It's about work, place and people and those
three things together. Ross Martin was saying, you've got to find
something like tourism that they can build on, create yourself as a
centre around a college, a Prince of    a branch of a university.
What options do these ex mining towns, not just in Ayrshire, places
like Fife, what options do these places have? They have options in a
shared identity of their history. It may be about tourism, it may be
about levels of co operation, social enterprise, and I get
distressed to hear when people talk about the demolition of fine
buildings in town halls, co  operative buildings, when there is
clearly a need for worker. There is work in the refurbishment of the
buildings, in the delivery of services for the local community.
Clearly, all of this is about engendering a sense of belonging,
enterprise, enthusiasm and identity with a particular place. The key, I
think, is that it has to happen alongside good levels of public
services for people in those areas. Good levels of transport
infrastructure, good opportunities for people to choose to live where
been throwing public money at urban regeneration for 30 or 40 years. It
really hasn't worked. You saw that first hand, the wasted money,
throwing good money after bad in regeneration projects. The irony,
Gordon, is that we have two a huge advantages in Scotland. We know
what makes Towne's work. Secondly, we have political unanimity across
the whole of the parliament in terms of the importance of towns
and town centres. They played with the regeneration fund, �60 million
out of 33 billion. If they had serious investment, brought in
private sector investment through organisations like the business
improvement districts... If you take these towns and put extra bus
services in, it doesn't do anything if there is not some sort of
private economy to provide jobs for people and things for them to take
the bus to? You need to develop the mixed economy that Andy was talking
about, private sector, public sector, all of them coming in.
Town's function like schools. Date function at their best when they
have comprehensive catchments. We need mixed communities, a mix of
policy suggestions and changes. will have to leave it there. A
quick look at tomorrow's front pages, starting with the Telegraph.
