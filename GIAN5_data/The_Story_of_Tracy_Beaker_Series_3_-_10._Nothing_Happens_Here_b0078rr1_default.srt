I can make my world come true All my dreams will see me through
  It doesn't matter What may come my way...
  No, no
Believe me now I will win some day.
  You can't have those until you've finished your chores.
  I have.
  Nearly.
  She hasn't even started.
Blab!
I finished mine.
Want me to water the veggies?
Suck up blab!
Hello, Earth calling Cam!
..Then we'll paint the car yellow and have snake pies.
  What?
  I had a pet stone once   it wasn't as boring as you!
Oh, I'm sorry. I was thinking about New York.
  What a place! And the writing course...
  Blah, blah, blah!
If it was that great, why haven't you written a bestseller yet?
I don't know what to write about.
Hello! You could write the adventures of Tracy Beaker.
The Amazing Tracy Beaker! Beaker The Bold!
Tracy In Space!
  A children's book based on...
  The most interesting person you know.
  They said write what you know...
  Like I said   me!
  I know about kids in care.
  M E   me!
I'm going to write a book about the Dumping Ground.
That'll take you less than 10 seconds!
Nothing ever happens here!
  Tracy.
  Why can't I tell anyone?
If the kids know I'm watching them, they won't act natural.
Their natural state is barely breathing!
  Agh!
  James!
Shh, keep your voice down. Oh, little brother.
  What are you doing here?
  I need to lie low. Don't tell anyone.
  Huh?
Bazam bazoo!
Marco! Why do we have to do all the work around here?
Oh, look, you can call it The Dumping Ground Kids Do Chores!
What's she twittering on about?
Cam's looking for ideas for her book about the Dumping Ground.
  I've got millions of ideas.
  You'll need illustrations.
Thanks(!) I don't want a pile of mad adventures.
Don't blow a valve   I'll write some proper stories.
  Quick, follow me.
Come on!
Social workers! I left their stupid halfway house for good.
  You ran away?
  Yeah, I have. I nicked a few quid off them.
  Why?
  It's stupid, but I needed to get here. Have you any cash?
  A little bit.
  I'll get a job straightaway.
  And a flat.
  Are you going to take me with you,
like you said you would? I knew you'd never let me down.
Why didn't you tell me about Cam's book?
Why don't you get bored on another planet in a distant galaxy?
Carry on like you would if I wasn't here.
  That's a lovely photo of you.
  It's to put on the cover of your book.
What book?
  You want to be in it, too?
  Not in it   ON it. On the cover.
So mums and dads can see how nice I look.
Somebody nice will come and take you home one day, I'm sure.
  Only if you put my picture on the cover.
  Let me get this right.
You're writing a book about Dolly?
  About everyone who lives here.
  Thanks, Dolly.
Agh!
  Who are you hiding?
  You're hurting me!
  Good!
  Agh! Get off!
  I will when you tell me.
  It's a secret!
  That's never stopped you before!
  Tell!
  Ow! Get off me, Jackie!
Can't I get any peace to be creative?
He's my brother, James! Now, get off!
And you're running away with him?
  Are you mad?
  You kept running away to your grandpa!
  That's different.
  I was never meant to be here in the first place.
  Nobody is.
What do YOU know about running away?
What kind of hiding place is the summer house?
Magic wand   make Teddy go!
Hi, Cam.
  I wrote my story down for you.
  Justine phoned you about the book.
It's about a beautiful girl trapped in a care home doing all the work.
And a prince rescues her?
Don't be wet! A family fostered her and saw her hidden talents.
They sent her to university.
They tested her brains. The results were amazing.
She went on to be a famous vet.
  Put my name above yours on the cover.
  Yeah.
I know! Why don't I disappear?
Writer of book, here!
Abracadabra, writer disappear!
  I swallowed a fly. All better now.
  Sure?
  Who are you?
  Never mind that now. Come on!
Here's the famous author!
I'm going off the whole idea.
  Hi! I've written a story for your book.
  It's me who's...
It's about this Dumping Ground girl, who everyone fights with.
She has lovely hair, unlike that grub who says she isn't pretty...
  This duckling grows up to be a swan?
  No. She gets her own back.
Have you thought about making it a recipe book?
Caring Meals For Kids   recipes by Duke.
  Thought you'd turn up here sooner or later!
  Who's she?
  Who told you?
Jackie, Jackie   you can't keep anything from the Beaker!
So you plan to take Michael to live happily ever after with you,
  don't you?
  I'm on the road   I can't take a little kid with me!
  You weren't going to tell him!
  You haven't thought this through.
  Where do you think they'll look for you?
  I needn't listen to this!
You do if you want us to help you.
  Why would you help?
  You may be big, but you're still a kid in care.
  Tracy knows.
  You may as well announce it on TV!
  Look, there's a problem.
  Your brother's sorry, but he can't take you with him.
  You're lying.
  He doesn't know how he's going to live.
  We'll manage.
  You won't.
  James'll look after me.
  He can't even look after himself.
  It's true.
  He can't take you with him.
  Get out!
You should stop him before he gets in trouble.
I hate you both! Tell him I don't want to see him again!
Well, um, that went well, I suppose.
Yeah, you've been a great help(!)
  If you're writing a story for my book...
  No way!
  Too much like work.
Thank goodness. I'm getting so...
But you can interview us about how bad life is here.
I'd like you to put in action   a car chase, an explosion or two.
  Sign here.
  What?
In exchange for our ideas, you'll give us half the profits.
I don't think you'll find a better offer.
It'll be a bestseller. People love books about suffering.
MOBILE RINGS Who's that?
  Our social worker.
  What's she doing here?
  Your social worker must've rung her. Go.
  Tell Michael I'm sorry.
Tell him yourself.
You have to go back to the halfway house.
Here's my pocket money. I've been saving up for months.
Give them back what you stole and say sorry. They'll understand.
  You'll have to get a job and save up and...
  Got it all worked out?
  I'll blab on you.
  He's the biggest blab in the Dumping Ground.
  Jackie!
  Jackie, Tracy, Michael! >
  Go! We'll keep Elaine busy!
OK, boss, but I will be back for you one day. I promise.
You better.
Let me past   I've important business!
But, Elaine, um, me and Jackie wanted a little chat with you.
I didn't come for a chat   I came here to see... Cam!
I heard about your book.
Cam!
  What's going on?
  She doesn't know!
Come on.
I've boxes of case histories and I can easily go and fetch them...
I just did some illustrations for your book.
Now, would everyone just stop giving me stuff for my book, OK?
  It's MY book!
  Oh, I forgot.
I mean, I forgot to tell you I decided
not to pester you with my stories.
Look, I just want to write a little book about normal people.
What   and no suffering?
No explosions, no skulls,
no horror, no adventures, definitely no fairy stories!
  Just my own little book about the Dumping Ground.
  Like I said,
  why? Nothing happens.
  She's right.
  It should be a cook book.
  Oh...!
I can make my world come true All my dreams will see me through
  No, no
My dreams will turn things All around
With a smile upon my face I can see a better place
  It doesn't matter What may come my way...
  No, no!
