Charlie!
Lola!
Charlie!
Oh! Oh!
I have this little sister Lola. She is small...
and very funny.
When we play Who Can Sit Still The Longest...
..Lola always has to win.
Mmm.
I've won!
  But I didn't move.
  Oh, yes, you did. Yes, you did. I always win.
Always, always, always!
Hmm!
I can stand on one leg longer than a flamingo.
Mmm.
Mmm!
I can run faster than a speedy, speedy cheetah.
And I can bounce higher than a bouncy kangaroo, Charlie.
See!
I've won! I've won!
I've won!
But do you have to win everything, Lola?
Yeah!
I've won!
'Hmm! I know. I'm better than Lola at the spoon game. So I say,'
Lola, how about a game of spoons?
Um, yes.
  I'm winning.
  No, you're not.
  I am!
  Not!
  Am!
  Ah! Charlie, what's that?
  What's what?
Lola, have you cheated?
Charlie, I've won.
'So, I thought,'
What about a game of snap?
Now, you do remember how to play snap, don't you, Lola?
  Yep!
  You need two cards that look the same.
Then it's a snap.
It's two cards that look exactly the same, then it's a snap.
  Three.
  ..Eight.
  Two.
  ..Five.
  Four.
  ..Six.
  Three.
  ..Five.
  Seven.
  ..Ace.
  Nine.
  ..King.
Snap!
But you can't do that. They have to be the same.
And a queen is not a king.
But queens are married to kings, and they both wear crowns,
and they live in castles. So it's a snap.
Hmm! It's not snap. You just made up a story.
I've won! I've won!
  Want to play again, Charlie?
  Hmm!
How about a game of...
  snakes and ladders, then?
  ..Ooh!
'There's no way Lola could cheat at snakes and ladders.'
So, you go UP the ladders and DOWN the snakes.
Ladders up, snakes down.
And then the one who gets to the top is the winner.
Do you understand?
I do understand. Yes, Charlie.
Six! One, two, three, four, five, six.
Up the ladder.
That's a three.
One...two...three.
Snake!
Lola, what ARE you doing? Snakes are for sliding DOWN.
It's the rules.
Oh, Charlie, everyone knows snakes AREN'T slippy and slidey.
Oh, they're easy to climb.
Oh, oh.
Da da!
Hey, Charlie. Look at me. I'm winning.
Six again. Yes!
One, two, three, four, five, six.
A ha!
Oh!
Charlie, Dad says you are not allowed to climb a ladder.
Not until you are 23.
Sorry, up the ladders and down the snakes. That's the rule.
Nearly there.
  Oh!
Four. One, two, three, four.
Snake!
Hard luck, Lola!
Now you've got to slide all the way down to the bottom.
I've won!
Oh, dear. Come on, Mr Snake.
We can do it.
I've won!
  I've won! I've won!
See, I've won!
You can't win all the time, Lola.
Yes, I can, Charlie.
Oh!
I've won! I've won!
'So then I thought of something that Lola could never, never win.
'When Dad took us to the park, I said,'
Lola, how about a race?
Oh!
It's once around the bendy tree...
..then two big swings on the swing...
..down the slide...
The first one back to the bench is the winner.
But, Charlie, I'm only little.
I haven't been on the big slide yet.
  Well, if you don't want to win the race, Lola.
  Oh!
..Steady, go!
See you at the swings, Lola.
Um...
Oh!
There!
See you at the slide, Lola.
Oh!
Yeah!
Ye es!
  Charlie!
  Huh?
  Charlie!
Can you help me?
Help me!
Help!
Oh! All right, Lola, I'm coming.
Hold on.
Whoo!
Look, I'm winning!
Not for long!
Yeah! And the winner is Charlie! Charlie! I've won!
I've won! I've w...
'And then I think, "Oh, dear." Cos I remember Dad saying,
' "Charlie, you must give Lola a chance cos she's so small." '
Oh! Ah...
'And I say...'
Are you all right, Lola?
'Do you know what Lola says?
'She says...'
That was fun!
But... But...I won.
Charlie, you don't have to win all the time, you know.
Are you asleep yet, Lola?
Yes.
How can you be asleep if you're talking to me?
I'm sleep talking.
OK, the first one to fall asleep is the real winner.
Charlie, I've won!
Charlie?
I've won!
No, I'VE won!
I've won.
