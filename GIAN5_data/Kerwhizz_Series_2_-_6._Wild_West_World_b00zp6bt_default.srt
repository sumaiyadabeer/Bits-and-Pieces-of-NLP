  Hi, Kerwhizz kids.
  Hello, Kerwhizzitor!
Howdy, partners. I'm Kerwhizzitor,
your quiz controller on this Wild, Wild Western of a show!
Don't I look swell in this cowboy hat?
Ah. Well. Do you want to meet our crazy Kerwhizzical teams?
Yeah!
Who will you be rootin' tootin' for when our contestants hit the floor?
Please welcome them all. Ninki and Pip!
I'm Ninki, I thinki that I'm the best.
With my hot pooch, Pip, we'll beat the rest!
Twist and Snout!
  I'm Twist.
  I'm Snout.
  We're cool, we're neat.
  Will skill...
  And sprouts.
  We're the team to beat!
Kit and Kaboodle!
  I'm brainy.
  I'm zany.
  We're Kit and Kaboodle.
  I'll electrify you.
  I'll use my noodle!
  Hi, teams.
  Wow! Look at Kerwhizzitor, Snout!
  Er...is he wearing lipstick?
  He's wearing a cowboy hat!
Which means... I think today's race is in the Wild West!
Wild West? Where? Where? Where's the Wild West?
  Rawr!
  The Wild West of America. It's a beautiful place.
A place where you teams will race!
But only after some questions.
  Oh, yes. To win Mods...
  For our racing Pods!
  Darn tootin', Kaboodle!
  Kerwhizzitor's talking different.
Darn tootin', Snout! He's talking Wild West!
Darn tootin'!
Teams, it's time for Kerwhizz question one,
where we meet that tricky toad...
Natterjack!
Today he's Sheriff Natterjack.
Check out his super shiny sheriff's badge!
Whoa! Look how he sparkles.
Style! A sheriff's badge!
Teams, do you think you can match Natterjack's natty badge
with one of these?
Is it the same as the green,
the red,
the yellow,
or the blue?
What do you think, Kerwhizz Kids?
We'll soon see if you're right! Start the Kerwhizzical clock!
Time's up. Which badge matches?
Team Ninki says...
  Red!
  Team Twist says...
  Red!
  Team Kit says...
  'Boodle and I say...
  Red!
What's your answer, my clever Kerwhizz Kids?
If you said red, you're well ahead!
All our teams were correct.
A sheriff's badge! I've always wanted one.
Then I can catch baddies!
I've always wanted a sprouty badge, so I can catch sprouts.
Snout!
Teams, it's time to turn to Natterjack question two.
Take a look at this.
  Wow!
  What is it?
  It's a Wild West wanted posted!
Right, Twist. A wanted poster of the Kerwhizz Gee Whizz gang!
Ooh!
Oh, yeah   ooh!
There's the Kool Kat Kid, Little Jack Natter and Arizona Pong!
Bet you they're baddies!
Teams, Kerwhizz Kids, look at these silhouettes.
Which silhouette is shaped like these three mean geezers?
Is it this, the yellow,
this, the green,
this, the blue
or this, the red?
Do you think you know the correct silhouette? Start the clock!
Tick, tock, stop. Who has the sharpest eyes today? Is it you?
Team Ninki says...
  We say yellow!
  Rawr!
  Team Twist?
  Yellow!
  Kit and Kaboodle.
  Uh oh!
We thought it was the blue silhouette.
What was your answer?
If you said blue, that won't do!
If you said yellow, clever fellow!
Well done, teams Twist and Ninki.
Er, Kit, why are all those characters wanted?
They've probably done something very naughty, right, Kerwhizzitor?
  Perhaps, Kit.
  They look really bad!
I wouldn't like to meet THEM in the race!
I would. I'd be a sheriff and catch them! I bet I would!
  Teams! There'll be no race if we don't get on with the quiz!
  Yeah!
We need to win the best Pod Mods to help us come first!
Rawr, rawr! Rawr, rawr!
Pod Mods! Pod Mods! Pod Mods! Pod Mods!
Today's Pod Mods will be just what you've WANTED for the race.
The team that wins the quiz will have first choice of...
a buffalo nickel to help you through doors,
a lasso to catch things   that could be yours.
Whoa! Style!
  and a sheriff's badge.
  The best by a mile!
Snout! We MUST get the badge! Then I can be the sheriff.
You'll need to answer all the questions correctly.
  Someone else wants the badge.
  I love that badge, Pip!
It'd look great on me!
A ha! Burping Herbert's in town! I think he's in the mood for food!
Herbert! Surely you're not going to eat any of these.
Look, Kerwhizz Kids. There's a cowboy hat,
a lasso, a smelly sock,
a saddle and a tumbleweed.
  Tumblesprout?
  Tumbleweed!
  Looks sprouty to me!
Look again at the cowboy hat,
lasso, smelly sock,
saddle and tumbleweed.
Uh oh!
Herbert WAS really hungry!
One of the objects has gone, but which one?
Was it yellow, a cowboy boot,
red, a cactus,
green, a cowboy hat
or blue, a horse?
What did our dotty dinosaur chomp on?
Start the Kerwhizzical clock.
Tim's up, so let's take a glance and find an answer.
Teams, what do you think Herbert chewed?
Green   the hat!
Yellow   the cowboy boot!
We said yellow, too!
What do you think? Herbert?
What snack's behind your back?
Well, fancy that! It's the cowboy hat!
Team Ninki, you were correct!
  The sheriff's badge is almost mine!
  Grrr!
  Rawr.
Don't understand it. Tumblesprouts are much tastier than hats.
Tumbleweeds, Snout! And they're not tasty, either!
And we're not winning the quiz!
I so want that badge!
Keep trying. Do you know which team's got most
correct answers so far?
Team Kit have one correct answer,
Team Twist have two
but with three answers out of three, it's...Team Ninki!
Eww!
Urgh!
Watch out   there's a pong about.
It's...
King Pong!
Hello there, Your Smelliness.
This is the round where you can win the extra special prize...
The Mystery Mod!
Pip, Snout, Kaboodle, this round's for you!
Keep an eye on these prickly cacti.
King Pong will pop out from behind them all very fast.
But which of the cacti will he hide behind last?
Let's play...
Hunt The Skunk!
Which cactus is King Pong hiding behind?
The red, the green,
the yellow or the blue?
Do you think you know?
  Pip says...
  Ruff!
  Snout says...
  Green!
  Kaboodle says...
  Blue!
What do you think? King Pong, come out, come out, wherever you are!
Well done, Kaboodle!
King Pong was behind the blue cactus!
Kaboodle, you're brilliant!
I am, I am, I am!
Now, this prize could help you run and run.
But it could spoil your fun.
Do you want it in today's Race World?
Y y y y y yes!
I think she wants it, Kerwhizzitor.
It's yours Kaboodle.
Do you want a sneaky peek at the prize?
It's a large cowboy hat.
It may keep the sun out of team Kit's eyes,
but it's so big, it may cause them a nasty surprise.
  Ah ha!
That sound means it's time for...
Kat Kool's Sound Round!
And here's Kat Kool now.
Just listen to his cool tune.
He's playing the banjo!
Listen again.
Now, teams and Kerwhizz Kids, listen to these four tunes.
Which one sounds the same as our Kool Kat's banjo?
Is it this, the red?
This, the green?
This, the yellow?
Or this, the blue.
Do you think you know? Start the Kerwhizzical clock!
Time's up!
Which of these was the banjo, please!
Team Ninki says...
It was the red note.
Team Twist says...
Red!
Team Kit says...
Red!
And you say?
Kat Kool, play your tune once more.
You're a brainy head if you said red.
All our teams got that question right. Great listening!
Yeah!
But which of our tuneful teams has won the quiz?
Hot dog   with four correct answers out of four,
our top twosome are Ninki and Pip!
Yeah!
How did you score?
Did you get four?
However you did, you're all great Kerwhizz Kids!
Pip, we have first choice of Pod Mods!
You do, Ninki!
So which Pod Mod will you choose?
Let's rustle up those Pod Mods!
Pod Mods, Pod Mods, Pod Mods!
You can have the Burpalo nickel.
Oooh!
The lasso.
Oh!
Or the sheriff's badge.
Wow! Anything, but the badge!
Sorry, Twist, I just have to have the badge.
It's so shiny... So me!
Oh.
I wanted the badge.
You came second, in the quiz.
Which Pod Mod would you like? Sheriff, or no sheriff,
I still want to catch the Kerwhizz Gee Whizz game.
That means I'll need the lasso.
The lasso is yours, Twist.
  Kit, you're left with...
  The Burpalo nickel.
It looks like a coin with an animal on it.
That's exactly what it is.
Look for a sign in the race that looks like it
  and you'll know exactly what to do.
  OK, Kerwhizzitor.
Without further ado, let's build those Pods and add those Mods!
We know where we're racing today, Kerwhizz Kids.
Reveal the Race World!
Wow!
Howdy! Let's have a rip roaring,
rootin' tootin' look through wild west world.
From Cactus Junction it's a rough ride down the Tumbleweed Trail
to Tin Pan Canyon. Then it's straight shootin'
through the Old Pine Goldmine
Two laps of the track, teams. Round and back.
  Ready?
  Ready!
Ready!
Ready!
Yipity kay go!
Oh, teams, remember to look out for the Kerwhizz Gee Whizz Gang.
They're wanted.
  I sure hope we don't run into them, 'Boodle!
  Me too!
Uh oh, there they are.
Meanwhile, our three teams hit Tumbleweed Trail.
Tumblesprouts!
No, Snout, tumbleWEEDS!
Now keep an eye out for those pesky bandits.
Pip, look!
A Burpalo ranch full of 100%, grade A Burpalo.
Moo!
I love Burpalos!
Give me a home where the Burpalo roam
Give me a home where the Burpalo roam...
How can we get passed?
I don't have the sheriff's badge, but I do have the lasso Pod Mod!
Yee ha!
I'm wrangling this out.
I'm wra a a a a a a a a a...
Well, that's really got Twist MOO ving.
Anyway, up ahead, the other teams have almost reached
the Old Pine gold mine.
No, the track's blocked!
It's the gold mine. How can we get in?
Hm.
Where have I seen that picture before?
On our Pod Mod.
It looks familiar.
Pod Mod!
I've got it! It's on our Pod Mod.
Oh!
One Burpalo nickel coming up.
And away they go!
With Team Twist back on track.
It's dark in here, Twist.
I wish I was at home with a nice cup of sprout juice.
Our terrific teams rise out of the mine.
They've almost finished lap one.
How will they do on lap two?
Hoppin' horn toads!
It's the Kool Kat Kid, Little Jack Natter and Arizona Pong.
And they're blocking the track.
Quick, the Pod Mod.
They'll run for the hills when they see who they're dealing with.
Sheriff Ninki.
They're not running away!
  Wow, Ninki's badge is dazzling the gang.
  Quick, let's go!
Come on, Snout, let's round those bad guys up.
  No chance, Twist, there's a race to win.
  Ohh!
Our teams are away again. But who will win the race?
And can they avoid the Kerwhizz Gee Whizz Gang?
Kit, it's quiet.
Too quiet.
It's the Kerwhizz Gee Whizz Gang.
Aaaaargh!
Aaaaaaaaargh!
  Snout?
  Yes?
  What's that sticking out of the Pod?
Er, I may have put a few tumblesprouts in the back for later.
Snout! I told you, they're tumbleweeds!
Yay, they're going the wrong way!
Style!
I'm gonna catch me the Kerwhizz Gee Whizz Gang.
Looks like Twist wants to chase, not race.
While way ahead, two teams zoom to the finish.
Ninki's catching up.
  Let's use the Mystery Mod.
  Great idea, 'Boodle.
Who turned the lights out?
Whoa! Whoa!
  Whoa!   Yeah!
  What a race track rodeo we had today, Kerwhizz Kids!
Well, darn my socks!
Whatever happened to Twist?
And Kit's hat?
And Ninki's sheriff's badge?
I rounded up the Kerwhizz Gee Whizz Gang.
Do you know what they were wanted for?
No idea.
They were wanted for tea with their friends and cousins.
Well, rock my chair! They weren't baddies at all, just good friends.
Good work, Sheriff Twist.
Style, Snout! Style!
Style.
