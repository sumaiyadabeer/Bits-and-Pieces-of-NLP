To Win It from 8.25pm.. But for now, This programme contains strong
language. You sound like a disaster. You've talked yourself out of this.
You wind people up. You're fired! You're fired. You are fired!
Good evening welcome to a new series of The Apprentice: You're
Fired. I'm brain braen brain. For the next 12 weeks, with the help of
guest experts we will get under the skin of our 16 business leaders as
they bat tl out to become Lord Sugar's choosen one. It's my first
day. It's vital at the start to make good first impressions.
supremely intelligent, ambitious, I'm an all round gifted individual.
The tone you are looking for is one of humility. I consider myself an
absolutely fantastic salesman. Everything I touch turns to sold.
The last thing you want to say is something that your colleagues are
going to remember forever. Success and money motivate me. My first
word wasn't mummy, it was money. It's nice to have them back, isn't
it? Let's meet our panel. Apprentice fans one and all. John
Torode, Jenne Eclair and Mark Frith. It was midnight in the boardroom
when it all began. It ended when one man's sausage failed to sizzle.
your chance, you blew it. Dan, Ladies and gentlemen, please
Yeah, no. OK. Dan, what went wrong? I got fired. OK. Let's roll back
even further than that. Why specifically. You sat through it
now, it's a tough thing I assume it watch? I spent most of that episode
behind a pillow. Cringe worthy moments on there certainly. I took
a strong leadership style. I don't know if you picked up on that?
Nicely put, yeah. You did, like a Sergeant major might with a team of
new recruits. Watching it back, what would you have done
differently? I would have won, for starters. The strategy I had was to
buy as cheap as possible. I think, John, will you have comments about
the quality of the sausages we produced today. To try and get some
stuff to market, and to make a profit. Which, I did achieve, just
£15 too little. It is a tight margin. You didn't win any admirers
with your management style. I'll lead the team, you do all the work.
Who is cutting the meat? Work quicker. Get that done now. Who is
cutting the meat? Who the lock is it? The message from your
colleagues isn't good. If aaachieve what I want, I don't care. First
impressions, knob. He has a whiff of arrogance about him. There
hasn't been a good word spoken about you about anybody yet.
quite surprised there wasn't a good word spoken. You are quite a
dictator. Is that the way it works in the TA nowadays, is it that
vicious? No. It's not. Chefs, for example, are famously dibg   
dictatal in the kitchens The chef has to know what they are doing
before they tell someone else what to do. They need to know the tasks
before they bark the orders. They don't know management style, they
are taught how to cook. That is why when they get taken off the stove,
they don't have the confidence to run the team they scream and shout.
As they get older and more experienced they calm down a little
bit. How many years would it have taken you to have Mel owed? Just
the one, I think. Really? Good. Jenny, would you take orders like
that? I have admiration for you. You pulled off the dictator thing
in a blue plastic bonnet, I don't think that is easy, I really don't.
I do sympathies with you now, you will have watched that, will you  
your willy will have shrivelled slightly. On terms of shouting
orders, and all, that you are an editor of a magazine, you don't
write all the article there is is an element of telling people what
to do. Where did he go wrong? one does it like that. In the
Apprentice there is a moral of the story in the shows. In this one, in
this day of age no one in the world of business has that aggressive
attitude to business. It doesn't exist any more. That is what you
thoughtless wanted and that would impress him. He's not impressed by
that at all. It went too far. The shouting and swearing was bizarre.
It was truly bizarre. You never sat down. You were standing up.
Everything was formal and jumpy. The other question I want to ask,
this is in your favour. There is a poison chalice element to this, you
took the job on the first task? Yeah, it is a poison chalice, I
think the majority of project managers who have been up first
have got fired. I'm certainly aware of that. If you have seen my
reaction on the film, as soon Alex Salmond I said, "I'm going to do
this" I instantly regretted it. Were you hoping someone would get
in and say, "me, me". At the end you said, "you didn't put yourself
forward" that is when they could not come back on. If you knew it
was a poison chalice, that is too big a risk to take. There is a one
in two chance you will go in the first episode. If you lose the task.
I wanted to win the task. I took a full on attack   Why take that
risk? You wanted to be there to the final. You are not the bloke who
wants to go in episode one? competing oond wanted to win. It's
not my style to sit back and let someone take the lead. I went for
it. If it had paid off by £15, I would have got used to the pressure
  I thought you were pre menstrual. I know what that's like. Let's take
a look at how the girls' team was lead by Joanna. Let's go for it. I
trust that you are all here to do a good job. Girls, there's a change.
We need to up the meat content. The final decision is to make the
sausage a gourmet sausage. Calm down and take your time. Freshly
made this morning. £6. OK, you guys I want you to go around the
businesses and carry on selling. Well done. You were all brilliant.
By contrast, did Joanna impress you it? She's lovely. She's a deputy
head girl. Because, I say deputy, there is a little bit of naughty in
her. She is probable not proper head girl. Like girls do, they like
each other for the first couple of days. I'm looking forward to them
all turning on each other. Which is inevitable. The boys went into pack
mentality immediately. But the girls pretending to be reasonable
decent honest people, for the time being. Obviously, they will go
psychotic quite soon. That's what we do! No, good for her. Northern
girl. Sort of, no nonsense, liked her. Can you take any more
management lessons from the way she ran her team? She asked for other
people's opinions about the name of everything and what was going on.
What they would sell. Everyone took it on board and agreed nicely, to
an extent. There was £15 between the two teams. It was a sales issue.
Your half of the team wasn't a sales masterclass. Your background
states are you a sales director. £   90p each. No. I can go out there
and sell. Hello, do you want some sausage? This is what you do Forlan
your day job? Umm. I didn't sell but I focused on being the project
manager. You are the manager make a decision? Which ever comes first.
What are we doing? Let's do something, which is a stocktake.
You only sold £14, actually? Not a top day, from a selling point of
view. I'd say one thing, in your defence, you created history. No 
one has tried to sell sausages door to door. I don't think I would
ever, if the door bell rang went, "sausage man". Out of all prot
ducts that I would sooner buy door  to door. Magic beans I would
quicker buy than sausages door to  door. Especially dressed with those
hats on., "would you like a sausage"? Why did you think,
obviously people are at home. They want a stranger to deliver
processed meat no proof of providence at the door. I would
murder sausages now. You were clutching weren't you? It was
breakfast time. Would you buy sausages off somebody? No, no.
Obviously, they will be knockoff. They will be weird. They will be
full of tape worm. You don't buy sausages from a stranger, as you
said, you don't know. Dusters, maybe. These were not good looking
A study in depression, a man at 4.00 am watching dry paste fired
out   Those sausage look when you go to the lav tree. That is what
they looked like. They were not apties advertising. Sausages come
out of this process extremely badly. This has been a bad episode of the
Apprentice for sausages generally? For the girls 70% meat. That is
about right am you can't make a sausage for more than that it will
explode and fall apart. It needs a certain amount of fat and grain, or
rusk, to take up the water so when it cooks it holds together. When
they said, "how much salt" that is 450 gram that is is half a kilo of
salt. How much meat did you have? Slightly less? Yeah. Some of your
team's selling skills left a lot to be considered? The entire box £60.
£55. £50. £53. £50 it is. The best bit, mind you, is his reaction.
Watch his reaction when he leaves the restaurant. Personally I would
have felt sheepish and embarrassed. Smacked it, boys. Smacked. It come
on! Let's go. There are peace deals that have been celebrated with less
enthusiasm than that particular deal. He is a surgeon. I don't want
a surgeon who is that happy with a mediocre result. I don't want a
surgeon coming in, "we saved a toe", we had to throw the rest of him out.
It was appalling. It was £50 that they didn't have when they walked
in there. They needed that money. By that point, that is why they
were so happy. It was £15. You did sell. You did make money? Yeah.
Making profit is the first thing. Lord Sugar is not a fan of people
who lose his money. Making profit was good, not quite enough. Had you
a run in with a number of members of your team. The notable one would
be Stuart. Or Stuart Baggs, The Brand. You haven't sold any of any
value. I did sell. How much did you sell? It's not about sales numbers.
You were sales director. If you could lead and sale. You don't have
to be leading and not sell. How many sausages did you make. That on
Any love lost there? I think Stuart is a great guy. Wow, you are good.
Very smooth. It's tense though presumably in the room? Yeah, I
think it is very tense. Going into the boardroom for the first time,
particular particularly when you know you are one of those two, you
see the series pan out and I hope I had learned from mistakes, but
failed to do so. There is a feature we have every week, the one that
got away. It's safe to say Stuart is definitely the one that got away.
To be brutally honest I have sold the most here and I always will,
because I know how to connect with people, I am good at that
psychology. Excuse me, Sir, you look like a sausage connosiueru. I
sold the most. You sold 14 packs. Sausages. If you have any problems
feel free to keep them to yourself. There's a line and I think you are
stepping over it. That's how a market stall works. I have to say
your aggressive sales pitch put a lot of people off. I was half way
to getting rid of two of them. I am not putting up with him for much
longer. What did you think with Stuart? You are going to have fun
with Stuart on this programme. already dreading the bit I meet
Stuart on this programme. I counted 49 seconds in the first episode
where he says the immortal words "everything I touch turns to salt"
you know what, when I heard that I thought he's only just begun this
boy. He is going to be very entertaining. He is a feisty little
one, isn't he. He is like a toddler. He doesn't know when to stop. He is
like one of those children you see in the playground pushing a swing,
you know they push it and they think they've done a good job and
it comes back and hits them in the teeth. He is an idiot.
But, he is only 20. quite young. At what point in the
swingsarc are we at the moment. How many episodes until the swing comes
smashing back into his face? think, it depends how Melissa
behaves next week, to be honest. It might be a swings and roundabouts
with those two. There could be a comeback. He knows his cards are
marked. He has to do brilliantly in the next couple of episodes or he
is gone. There could be a twist in the tail here. I I hope it's mine
he is doing as he works out on his calculator. Like Matt Lucas when he
does that. Yes, Stuart may be a loudmouth, but you, you even had
mild mannered Raleigh giving out to you. He is aggressive and and
thugish with other members of his teams. He shouts at us, he doesn't
let us get on with our jobs. I wanted to sell things and I didn't
get that opportunity. It wasn't fair, it was shameful.
That was genuinely moving. Shame on
you, shame! Do you think your card got marked with Lord Sugar really
early on in this particular exchange? Actually, if you don't
mind, Dan, just sit up in the conventional way. Yeah. We look as
if we are having a chat in the golf club. Thank you.
How chilled out were you. Too relaxed do you think. A little too
relaxed. There is still a chance Stuart could have gone. We are not
making anything like a big deal about this, this wasn't just a
slouch, this was slouchgate. This sealed it for you. I have never
seen anyone do that. Automatically everyone because they're nervous is
even more straight, and they look look weird. For you to be like that,
why were you that relaxed? I don't get it. It comes from how I was on
the task, being formal and led from the front. And got to the boardroom
and I was feeling a lot of pressure, a real chance I could get fired. To
deal with it I thought I will relax. Got a little bit too relaxed.
I intend to maintain a certain standard. I will scratch though.
You can be too relaxed in these situations, does it not break the
ice. It's OK to be relaxed if you know them. When you are going home,
it's difficult. The leg crossed was hilarious. I could see your knees
above the desk and I thought no!. You have not never done. Let's hear
what the boss and your colleagues have to say about you.
Dan alienated all of his colleagues shouting and screaming out orders
and not doing anything himself. dictated with a very loud mouth.
Don't  ... The way he demeaned people. He had no ideas about the
strategy we should take to selling. What the hell was Dan doing? It was
a bit of a spare part. If he felt that was the way you motivate
people and run a business, then he was absolutely miles off beam. Dan
had to go. Now, we know you have had your ups
and downs in business. What can you take from this? They're right. The
way I tried to lead that task was to get people around a common
common objective, to make money, which we did achieve. The way I
went about doing it to bully people people perhaps was the wrong
approach. Not my next, and it's certainly not reflected in the way
I do business. Business is built on relationships for months and years
and you have time to form late a partnership with people, and with
staff. We had 24 hours to come up with something and get it to market
and deliver. It's not the way I do business in the real world. It's
the way I came across there. You won't see that from me in the
future. You had three companies you set up in college. That's right.
events company. Yeah. There was... Embroidery company. Sorry what?
Embroidery. Garment for film. Two ladies in Southampton that did my
embroidiery. Did you shout at them, knit like you have never knitted
before! They got results though. They got
results, yeah, I have never seen anyone in embroidery say we got
results. We get results in cross stitch. You wouldn't go back into
the embroidery world. I would take a look at it. He will is sa
certainly made her presence felt in the first week. You open a deal
with someone and you don't close it? I take what you have said.
you have skimmed straight over it. It's not about me. Sorry. It's not
something we can just brush over. It's only right and professionalism
that I close the deal. It's a matter of professionalism.
Now I know what pecking order means. She's the one to go. I don't know
about that. When somebody said what sort of breed of chicken are you
using, she said free range. She's so confident. You think she's going
to be here for a while? I think she is. Also she does like to really
get amongst it and stands her ground and really fights for what
she thinks about. Whether it's the right thing to think about or not I
am not sure but she does stand her ground. There's a certain
platinum... Seeing Melissa makes me want to dye my hair brown and put
contact lenses in. It's very bothering. Because, you know, she's
got a mother and even her mother must be thinking, no, Melissa, no.
Oh God in Heaven! I find myself just terribly embarrassed every
time she opens her mouth. Just rubbish comes out. Thank God she
was there in the girls' team because everything was nice and
they got on so well and everything was highifies. To have her shaking
it up and she sensed a weakness in Joanna and exploited it time after
time. That was the only air of tension in that group. It should  
I imagine it will, refur tpas on many occasion    resurface on
occasions. Sometime she's going to ask questions and they're going to
need dam good answers, she knows what she's doing. She was the one
to say go gourmet. Don't dismiss this guy, act act upon what he says,
and she did. I really like Melissa. I thought she has got a good chance
of doing well. I really liked her. Having seen the VT back, we
probably seem similar in terms of personality now. I can see why, a
kin dread spirit. Shouty, shouty. We get on hugely well. Two
candidates who got off to a great start are Liz and Stella.
Our outlay for lamb is about £140. We think you are going to make 90
trays, that's 90 packs of six sausages. OK. Our cost is £5.24. It
should be £3.30. That's massive. Stella and Elizabeth are hot on the
figures. Thank you very much. Did you have anyone doing that job?
No. Chris should have had that job and it took him   he is an
investment banker, apparently t took about two and a half hours to
work out what the pack should be. The girls are fantastic. They've
done so well across all areas of that task. I wish I was a girl.
were at times. Back to you at this stage. For the dreaded vote. Do you
think Lord Sugar was right to fire Dan? Yes. I do. I think the
management style I think absolutely. I am sure that actually the cameras
came on and you were in a pressurised situation and you tried
to pull out all the stops but the swearing and shouting was a little
bit over the top. Sorry, mum, for the swearing. You and Stuart should
have gone. You should have shared the blame and then you wouldn't
feel so on your own now. I am sorry, but you messed up. You really
messed up. I can see where this is going. We haven't even got to them
yet. OK. Your turn, please. Your cards
at the ready. If you agree with Lord Sugar hold up fired. If you
think he got it wrong, hold up hired.
Oh! Is that the worst ever? That's a record. That must be a record.
any chance? Yeah. Big wave, hello Dan's family.
Good to have you. Good for you. I am afraid that is   they passed
their judgment as well. My commiserations on that. We didn't
have long to Ponder what to give you for your management style. The
only thing we could give you would be really old school. Our advice is
if you use it like that it will be more effective. That's for you as a
gift from us. Thank you very much.
Even though you only had one week on which to make an impression,
here are your highlights. My number one rule in business is
just locking do it. Dan the Man.
I am smarter, I am brighter, I am better. That would have been funny
normally. Let's look for something sexy. You don't ask, you don't get.
I know I will be successful and my success will be Lord Sugar's loss.
Ladies and gentlemen, Dan Harris.
Well, that is the first firing under our belt. Thanks to all my
guests. Dan will be on BBC breakfast tomorrow and there are
clips and links on our website. Next week they learn that life can
be a beach when they have to design a hl day product    holiday product.
I have an idea. Have you got abikini top with the tassel bits?
