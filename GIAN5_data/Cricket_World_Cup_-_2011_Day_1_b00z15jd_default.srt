Thunderball and Lotto results are highlights of the World Cup. Over
in the sport as 14 teams battle it out for cricket's most coveted
prize. We will have our own team here and all bases covered. We will
start here in Bangladesh and follow England from their fir their fir
against the Netherlands in Nagpur and if they play to their potential
they will play until 2 and in Mumbai. I will bring you fantastic
action if Colombo and the brand new venues there. We will explore what
else this beautiful host nation has to offer. We might even get to a
World Cup to be held on the Asian continent. It got off to a
spectacular start on Thursday. we are at the 10th cricket World
Cup. It would not be a major sporting event without a grand
Opening Ceremony. A big night for Bangladesh who only made their
World Cup debut in 1999 and a party at the National Stadium here is a
perfect precursor for the tournament as it builds and the Cup
that counts. Let's look at the 14 teams taking part. Each team will
play the other six sides in their seven group set. The four winners
of the knock outs go to the semis with the finals the take place in
Mumbai on 2 and. Who are the favourites to lift the trophy? For
India playing in the line up alongside explosive talent they are
the bookies favourites. They last won back in 1983 with victory over
the West Indies Lord's. Australia have won the World Cup a record
four times and are thend are the champions. Confidence is high
following their six month thrashing of England Down Under but has
helped their batsmen face up to the ball which could be the key.
England were losing finalists on three occasions. An exhausted
key depbgsals of this maturing exciting team. South Africa are a
leading one day team. A poor record has left many doubting their mental
resilience. Can they prove the critics wrong? Sri Lanka won the
World Cup back in 1996 the last time the tournament was played on
their home soil. Underdogs then, favourites now a team brim wing
match winners. Those are the favourites to win this year's World
Cup but as Sri Lanka themselves proved in 1996 this is a tournament
that provides its fair share of surprises. Winners in 1992 and an
inspirational Imran Khan Virender Sehwag will lead them.lead them.
never winning New Zealand have consistently punched on the world
stage. Bangladesh will be a match for any team with the home fans
behind them and conditions in their favour. Twice world champions
dooring their dominance in the '70s the West Indies still have the
individual talent to compete with anyone but can they consistently
perform as a team? The island teams have proven they can beat the big
teams in the tournament so although they may not win the World Cup they
could service satisfy significant day in the outcome. Zimbabwe has
emerged from international exile more than capable of causing an
upset. Joining them in Group A are Canada and Kenya who reached
qualification in 2009. Ireland qualifyed as the top associate team
and reached the super 8 stage four are
the Netherlandss who play England in their first game a rematch of
the opening tie of the 2020 World Cup which saw the Dutcw the Dutcus.
Predicting a winner is almost impossible but we can guarantee
plenty of noise, fun and passion from the local fans. I can see
Richie has made some new friend. Ever since it was announced that
two of the three hosts Bangladesh and India would contest the opening
fixture the locals here have been crowning down to that first ball.
For them the long wait is finally over. As India make the short trip
to a very proud Bangladesh nation and to the capital which is home to
more than 12 million people making it the ninth most populated city in
the world. The stadium situated in the Napur district was built in 206,
it holds 25,000 people and was named over one of the country's
freedom fighters. The team here will rely on the sum of their parts
if they are to make an impact. MS Dohni. It could be Tendulkar's
swansong. What better way to bow out. Hassan decided to field first,
no doubt aware the winners of the last 12 wins here have batted
second. To players remain from Bangladesh's 2007 World Cup W the
average age of this side 23 will defend the young pace men. And
Shakib Al Hassan will try to restrict at formidable looking
Indian batting line up. Tendulkar is a leading run scorer while
Virender Sehwag is more than capable of winning any match on his
own. Keep ann. Keep anor a star of the future. With the ball Doni has
three font line seamers the call on. And plenty of spin options. We join
the match from the very first ball with Shakib Al Hassan bowling to
charged up for the first ball. is the result of the first ball for
2011 Kickett World Cup? Good delivery. The result is a boundary.
What a way the start the World Cup. Good bounce there. Right on top of
it. Smashing it through the covers for a boundary. Here we go. What a
way to finish the over. Start would a bounce drifplt finished with an
over. One over gone.    boundary. India gets off the
mark. This could be a boundary too. Yes. Reaches the rope. Timing on
that occasion good. Good working shot. Has he got it enough? He has.
Third boundary. Pressure on Bangladesh right up. Five shots.
Again easy pickings this for the Indian batsmen. This is a important
match for both sides. A win early on in the tournament a win in good
fashion gives you the momentum needed. Again leg stump. Reaching
the boundary once again, this will be frustrating for the Bangladesh
captain. This really is pretty ordinary bowling. A good move to
bring the spin around. A good start. That is Bangladesh's strength t
batting and these surfaces, the play. Plenty of options there. We
get only a single so just two runs off the over. It is 38. Almost
carried back. Again played early. Two good offers back to back.
Getting the boundary to take India over 50. Good power play. India
separate away.    straight away. A fulls to. Easily put
away. Virender Sehwag this time. That is very, very very vifrplt
wonderful use of the feet.    Virender Sehwag. Wonderful use of
the feet. Props here. Big problems. And that is the glow that
Bangladesh wanted. Both Indian batsmen at the same end. The
greatest scorer of one day cricket of all times, Tendulkar who is on
the way back. A simple innocuous push to mid on then Virender Sehwag
and Shakib Al Hassan wonderful feeling. The throw is a good one
and Tendulkar stranded. After making the most delicious start he
is gone and India are 69/1. that has runaway for 4. A little
short and wide outside that off  stump. He went for 20 in his first
two. It was a nervous start from Shakib Al Hassan. He is back into
the attack. Took some punishment in those first the overs. Looking wide
at Virender Sehwag. He is looking wide to bowl straight as there is
not much margin there. Three for India. Down the leg side and fine
leg is wide. So that is four. added problem for the bowler now t
left hander and the right hander at the ceegs.     crease. 12
boundaries and six have come from the bowling of Shakib Al Hassan.
The skipper has some thinking to do. The on the leg stump flicked away
for a couple. Could be three here. Going back to the third. That is
terrific running from Virender Sehwag. From now we are going to
have left arm spin from both end. Virender Sehwag smiets it. That is
a massive 6 to bring up his 50.    smites. He does like the flamboyant
shot and that is a 6 to bring up his half century here. That is just
getting an off side. Short of Tamim Iqbal. Nicely bowled. Brilliant
fielding. In the air. A case of mistiming here Sanjay. Technically
that is short. He flipped. Appeal for the fielder there. Was going to
use his left foot to stop the ball. Before he could do that just lost
his foot hold. It is not that easy pitch to baton. That score can be
misleading and they have really batted well to have this kind of a
run rate, 6.41. Saw the gap. Beautiful shot. Found the gap with
precision. There is the new bowler. Gone! Just the break through that
is needed. Surprising. The ball just skidding off the pitch. Also
may have just kept a little low but completely misread it. The crowd
erupts. I just have the impression maybe he was trying to run the ball
down. Let's have a look. In fact he was trying to play the flip shot.
He has got out in similar fashion earlier as well. Does not always
discover the ball and he can sneak back, 39, 152/2. Stkpwhrup in the
air but there is a huge gap on the leg side. Well done. Does a very
good job in the deep. This time he has hit that with a little more
power. Same direction. Make sure he gets a boundary, second attempt.
That is a good strike. It has found the gap. We will get the boundary
as well. A good strike forward to make the ball on the half volley
and put it away. Yes, still has to be put away. Fine shot. Slowly but
surely getting into side here.. That is a good effort. Three runs
confidently taken. Nicely played. Excellent from Virender Sehwag. He
played the leg and he will get the boundary. This ball will be changed
after 34 overs. Let's be aware of that. A wide signal. Yes, if you
didn't hit it, you could not hit anything. It had to be a wide.
Virender Sehwag on strike on 99. So Â£  fast around the ground. Gets it
easily. Up goes the bat. 14th 100 of his career, his second in the
but. This is the first    World Cup 2011.. Superb innings. He looked
good right from the word go. He has looked like a man on a mission
after that cover boundary a while ago. Good placement again. Beats
the field weefpl will get to the boundary.    beats. These are big
runs for India. 10 run tossing. his hand through the ball. The
speed of his hands. The onside, short ball, square leg up in the
circle. Easy pickings. 14 off the over and India 219/2. Now we have
the batting power play. Yes, I taught this might happen with the
change of ball. The change of ball mandatory after 34 overs it means
they get a harder ball a shiny ball a new ball. Good time to have a bit
of power play with the batsman, eight wickets in hand. The 21
control is back on. Smashed. Think it took a bit of his ankle with him.
Virender Sehwag just says "You can have it back!". That is the 100th
delivery Virender Sehwag has faced. Making it 108. Gosh, he has
absolutely leathered that. That as gone for a huge 6. Other contents
for the bowler Virender Sehwag, 242/2 and 35 overs have been bowled.
That's good running. See that to keeper had not taken it cleanly.
One shot that Virender Sehwag has not taken on today really. We have
not seen him play a pull shot or a hook shot. Every time he has
elected to get out of the way Cyril Despres looks to be looking around
the leg side. One ball le has not coped with particularly well today,
the short ball. Just got him between the fleshy area between the
top of your pd and the bottom of the bat    pad. Virender Sehwag
down the pitch. Looking really dangerous Virender Sehwag. Still a
long way to go. Only in the 37th over. Once again he goes up in the
air! Clears it. Yeah, very comfortably indeed. A huge 6.
Virender Sehwag is going for everything here. It is four this
time. He has decided to take a part this Bangladesh bowling. He is
limping. I think he realises he perhaps needs some treatments. This
is the partnership which is doing the damage. Against Bangladesh, 109.
Century partnership for the third wicket Virender Sehwag is 130 not
out. Virender Sehwag has a runner. Virt has a wonderful one day
international record average of 4 and that is a half century for the
22 year old, Virat Kohli. Casually carves it up in the ire an chips it
for 4. Another boundary for Virender Sehwag, the highest score
by an Indian player against Bangladesh. 11 overs to go. Has he
got the distance? He has. He is stepping up now Virender Sehwag.
Terrific shot this. Lovely use of the feet. Batting on 149 Virender
Sehwag. The Big fulls to. Could unless be a no ball? It's high a
fulls to. Getting two runs and moves to 151. Virender Sehwag opens
up. The Ball being pulled back to flex his muscles. This time a
couple of bounces into the ropes. There is no respite for the bowlers.
Virender Sehwag at one end and Virat Kohli to contend with at the
other. Now these are high scores in World Cup. The coach leading the
charge with 180 not out currently. Virat Kohli wants to come back for
the second. He l he is a young man. 308/2. There have been a few shots
between the mid onfielder. Can still pick up boundary. A view
appreciate piece of timing. Virat Kohli and Virender Sehwag have
played on the back not and used the pace in the pitch. Gone. High in
the air. The fielder at long on is looking to the sky! Virender Sehwag
now batting on 167. Attractive batting completely dominating the
Bangladesh bowling attack. There he goes again. Another super shot. It
is a 6. Tremendous shot from virtd virt.    Virat Kohli. Beautiful
shot A lovely off drive from Virat Kohli. Just been dominant, great to
watch as well. A full toss mind you but beautiful timing. A tired shot.
Inside edge back onto the stumps and that brings an end to a superb
innings from Virender Sehwag. How often have you seen him now with
the ball onto the stumps looking to lay that square cut, at square leg
and playing the ball onto the stumps. Good bowling by the
Bangladesh captain. The previous delivery also was high as a block
ball. This time he gets Virender Sehwag. Virender Sehwag, what an
innings. 175. 375/3 India in the 40th over. All eyes would be on
Virat Kohli and Yusuf Pathan now. 95 now with that single. Has to
hurry. Yusuf Pathan went to hurry really. He was running towards the
danger end. India at the moment are picking for a couple more runs then
they will be the third highest. Here comes the chance for Virat
Kohli. Still to balls remaining in this Indian innings and a chance to
get 10 on the debut of the World Cup. He gets there. Fifth 100 in
one day international for Virat Kohli, his second against
Bangladesh and it has been his first in the World Cup. This young
man has gone from strength to strength, very consistent, scoring
runs at a good clip. This time the outside edge has been taken. The
finger has gone up and off the last ball of the Indian innings Yusuf
Pathan has impressed. India end up with a massive 370/4. Virender
Sehwag the top scorer at 17. Tendulkar unfortunately run out but
looked good in his 49. And Virat Kohli doing extremely well to reach
his 100 off just 83 balls. Bangladesh struggle from balancing
one. The first ball of the match was smashed for a boundary. There
after he just could not get it right. 9.86 was the economy rate.
The pick of the bowlers as far as the economy is concerned, six runs
per over. A hugely impressive performance from India's batsmen as
India post the fifth highest total ever seen as a cricket World Cup.
If Bangladesh are to get anywhere near their winning target they will
need Tamim Iqbal fire from the off. And with Strauss and Muri, before
that let's get on with Bangladesh's run chase. Tear run rate is 7.42 an
over. Bangladesh have opened their account. Has a bit of glove on that.
Just watch the umpire for the leg  bye signalled by the um mire.   
umpire. Well bowled. They have all gone up. Very fullback into the
left hander, looked absolutely straight. If it hit him on the foot
this has to be close. So it is a legal delivery. Hawk Eye is in. The
ball has pitched in line. It is pitched on. Now it is swinging and
Hawk Eye shows that that ball is missing leg stump. The ball has
just done enough stow the umpire's decision stands. That is just a bit
wayward from Kahn. Second over. A bit of a waft outside the leg stump
but he won't mind that. He has that ball to swing again. With their
baton it   was there? Yes there was. Beautiful delivery. Swinging late.
Nipped in seam position. That could have cleaned up Imrul Kayes very
easily. A bit short. That is called away. It has not been timed. It
might just make it though. It has. It's a no ball. This one hit the
boundary to the chorus of the roar as well. This will now ab free hit.
Over the wicket. Three hits and it has been smacked away. This is
lighting all the fires for Bangladesh. Shanthakumaran
Sreesanth is getting carveed away here. What a glorious shot. That
was just so elegant. Caressed away for 4. The swing of a baton the
inside leg out of the leg stump for two. Runs are coming from every
wrfplt he will have to think is he going to bring on a slow bowler to
change the pace of what is going on here. Imrul Kayes. Patel, he's
topped it on. Imrul Kayes that wonderful cameo innings has come to
an end. He is part of his own down fall. Inside edge onto the stumps.
is a fielder in the deep. Won't get there. He has banged his head. He
is a bit concerned. Just lost track of the rope. Just watching the ball.
Junaid Siddique another left handed batsman for Bangladesh. Outside
edge. Gone down to third man. gone for it. Gone to mid on, going
to pick up four runs. He has been there for a while and now looking
to lose his opposite. opposite. all of the over. Shot at length again.
He has it through. A well played ball on top of the bounce for the
left hander. Four more. Not a great finish for Patel. 11 overs gone
77/1. Gone state up. Two fielders. Yusuf Pathan is on the ground but
this time he almost had the ball in his hand. Still a pretty uphill
task for Bangladesh. They are not willing to take a backward step.
You must realise if you are the fielding side in a situation like
thrbgs every ball will add to the pressure. And when you have set.
The Opposition a tall run rate to chase you get into the stage you
can lose wickets in a hurry, not just one. Junaid Siddique on strike.
He has beaten him with a beauty. It will be a referal upstairs. You see
clear think stumps have been broken. The bails are off their grooves
before Junaid Siddique gets his not behind that line. That is the key.
The line is the wicket keeper's. Junaid Siddique has gone.
Bangladesh have lost their second wicket. 129/2. Shakib Al Hassan the
Bangladesh captain comes in. Could that to be third one tonight is. He
goes down. That's nicely played. We will give him yet another. A long
time but they will still cherish it t first game in the cricket World
Cup 2011 and Tamim Iqbal picks up another. Bangladesh need 210 runs
the win and they have 21 overs to go. It is a very rounded equation.
10 runs an over. Now is that going onto hit the stumps? What are the
Indians going to do? Had India gone for a review, what we have
happened? In fact in lining go onto his leg stump? And in fact very
much on the stumps so that could have been given. That is a 6. Tamim
Iqbal finally opening up here. Patel. Comes in. Just preparing his
seamers for the ball that will be changed after the 34 overs. Gone!
Straight to the fielder. Tamim Iqbal looks a little surprised.
Patel has struck once again. Out for 70. 180/3. 22 wicket keeper
batsman of the Bangladesh team comes in. Nice shot. Everything
right about it. The crowd set up for a while which is a good thing.
That is cleverly played. Goes to the boundary. A good hand here by
the Bangladesh catch he is keeping the scoreboard ticking along.
but they need a few more boundary shots now because the rate of the
over is 12 almost 13. So 49 and not out for the captain. That is a good
half century. Fine innings frost the Bangladesh captain. It has come
quicker than a run a ball. That's up in the air! It is taken in the
deep. The captain is dismissed after a fine end. Played well.
Shakib Al Hassan, did not really get hold of this one. Well inside
the boundary and for a very good innings frost the Bangladesh
captain 55 from 50 balls for Bangladesh now. 234/4. He timed it
well but just didn't get the elevation. Very good bowlers. Tough
hand when you come in low down the order having to score 15 an over
for the start. To keeper going for 25. 248/5. Bowls straight. The ball
bowling in on the face of middle stump. Another wicket for India.
has bowled state. He has hit the stumps and he has gone for 6.
Bangladesh 261/6. Patel liked over mid wicket for a big 6. Hoiked. He
will not enjoy that at all. Middle stump half way up and he picks up a
fourth wicket. He picks up 9. Patel 2, Bangladesh 270, 5/70. Final
delivery. Has he got another lfpltd BW? He has! He was    LBW. He was
looking for another wicket. He has it. After the last ball of his
allocation 10 overs. Bangladesh lose their eight. 279/8. His first
five wicket haul in international one day cricket. Could there be a
run out? A direct hit? I'm sure Steve Davis would like this
referred upstairs. That is the third umpire. Let him have a look.
This could be out. Out is the call a fine piece of fielding by Singh.
Bangladesh have lost their ninth wicket. Shakib Al Hassan was gone
for nought. 280/9. And that is the end of the match with Bangladesh
283/9. Doni all smiles. India have got off to a winning start. They
will look at that and, well, they will probably ask some questions as
to why some could not have gone onto get a big score but they were
always up against the race. 283/9. India winning by 87 runs. India's
bowlers. Patel 4/48 in his 10 overs 2/40. From Kahn and a wicket for
Singh who bowled beautifully. The summary of this match t opening
match of the ICC cricket World Cup 2011   India a formidable 370/4.
Bangladesh 283/9 and India have won by 87 runs. Virender Sehwag, well
well done. You spoke about getting revenge over Bangladesh fplgt was
that your motivation today? Yes. I still remember we lost to
Bangladesh in the 2007 World Cup and I mentioned in one of my
interviews when we play on 19 February that is a revenge game for
us and we were not very confident the way we played in a couple of
practice games and we were confident so the moments we went to
the field everybody was charged and no, ex spgsly we did well.
Everybody thought you were going to beat the record of the highest in
the World Cup, 188. Has gar Yea said anything? Was he relieved or
disappointed    Gary. No u he did not say anything. Having the
highest individual score by any individual in World Cup so I
thought they scored 17 and 183  something so I remember their runs
but not Gary Chasing 371, you were always up against it, weren't you?
Yes, 7 30 runs too many. If 300 was there it was chasible and the way
we batted I think we batted very well but the runs were too many.
What was the game plan? What were you talking about in the dressing
room in the change of innings? We wanted to chase the runs but with
217 balls we could not get too many runs but I'm sure we will fight
back strongly. A great batting performance from India. It will
increase expectations because you are already preseason favourites.
think we will concentrate on the process. We will play well and play
cricket to look after themselves so we are not worried about the
pressure and we have inform play a game of contradict yet and if you
play well, if you    cricket, if you stick to the game plan I think
India will look after themselves. To confirm after the first game of
the 2011 cricket World Cup not surprisingly India is on the top
group B, Bangladesh is topping it up. England, Ireland, South Africa
and the West Indies are topping up. Near a World Cup legend. Sonny,
once again it was India's superb batting line that got them through?
Yes, they got off to a good start. There were good partnerships which
helped to keep the momentum. If you do not have big partnerships or
there is a fall of wickets sadly the momentum is lost and you are
not able the get the run thanks India eventually did. You end up
with maybe 290 or 300 which sometimes cannot be enough on a
good flat pitch like that one. good was the innings from Virender
Sehwag? Terrific simply because of the application factor. He says
when the tournament started he wants the bat as many overs as
possible. He gets off to flying start. Brilliant cameos of 30, 40
in four or five overs but gets on. He has realised if he can baton for
that many overs he will have 150 to 170 and every time India get that
he will baton to score. He said he was very nervous but didn't show
it.. It is not that he is a newcomer to one day cricket but
this is his first World Cup game. For somebody who is 22 it was an
exciting time and obviously he was nervous. The fact he was batting
with his captain Virender Sehwag eased the butterflys because
Virender Sehwag took the pressure off limb. Virender Sehwag was
falling so freely at the other end virtd virt could open out and play
   Virat Kohli. England's preparations have hardly been idea
after the drubbing by Australia. The management team have device
Adelaide switch in tactics they hope will see England crowned world
champions on 2 and. The news here is that Kevin Pietersen will have a
final chance to become again qaipbtded with opening the batting
in sub continue nant conditions.     subcontinent. We want to know the
health of the World Cup. It is getting better every time. Tim
press known is fully fit. We expect Jimmy Anderson to be fit for
tomorrow so we are pretty much up to full strength again which is a
big sigh of relief going into the tournament with a few problems. It
will be thighs the field our full side. Petersen is going to open the
batting with you for the World Cup. When was that decided? We first
thought about it in Australia to be honest. The conditions out here,
you need to take advantage of the first 10, 15 overs. Kevin is
obviously a very powerful batsman. To get a player of that quality
coming in first up will hopefully put. The Opposition teams under
pressure. We like the idea of it. We are very encouraged by his
reaction to the idea. He was keen to do it himself. It allows others
to bat middle order gains at spin which is something he is very good
at. It kind of fits our side pretty well for this World Cup. Obviously
we all need to play well for the tactic to work but we are very
confident we can do that. What can the fans hope for realistically for
this World Cup? We are here to win it, only here for one reason, no
doubt. It will be a big challenge in the subcontinent conditions the
subcontinent teams have a slide advantage but it is all about.
Building momentum. You will get did the stage hopefully you get into
the quarterfinals then it is a caves winning two or three high 
pressure games in a row and all the side will be on an equal footing
and it is who ever handles the sides the best will come away if
the trophy. Win the Ashes away at home and the 2020 World Cup with
the World Cup being dangled in front of you? We have had a lot of
suck Sos as a group over the last two years which gives Australia lot
of hope but there is a long way to go. To start thinking about lifting
World Cups and things like that at this stage would be naive and
dangerous so let's get the first game under our belt. Let's get a
good head of steam going then hopefully we can do well in the
latter stages. Exciting times indeed and England are in good
shape ahead of their opening game against the Netherlands. They will
do their best to forget the last time they played the Dutch in a
limited overs tournament. Ange impressive performance against
Pakistan. A much needed knock from Collingwood and true art broad. I'm
joined by the BB cricket correspondent. England's chances at
this year's World Cup? They are in the chasing pack. India are my
favourites, they are easy ones to pick. They have every base covered,
they look very strong fplgt Sri Lanka I like the look of but you V
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, other teams in that pack
that have to start well and as lodge as they do not slip up
against any of the Minnows along the way they should proceed but
once you get to the quarterfinals it is anybody's game. I like the
way Petersen has been promoted to opening which is a surprise but
someone said he has not been doing very well lower down the order,
let's see. He has had time to bat. As an outsider how do you view
England's prospects? They will have to beat India in the group game.
That will give them a lot of confidence because beating India in
India is not easy. Beating India in Bangalore is not easy but it could
build their confidence and give them the belief they are a good
one day side because they have not had a great time in Austin one day
series where they were beaten quite comprehensively by the Australians
so a big win against India would do their morale wonders. And Petersen
as opener? From being a middle  order batsman in limited overs to
opening the batting much he has 40  odd centuries in limited overs
wicket, over 17,000 runs and while there is not the advantage of age
at this time it is the right move because it gives him top
acknowledge that he can bat for 50 overs if needed. He can take
advantage of the field and has all the shots in the book plus new ones
like the switch hit and it will be a plus for him to open the batting.
Needless to say England have to get off the winning start on Tuesday?
Yes, in Nagpur, we know what happened the last time they played
against the Netherlands in a limited overs game. They should be
fine. They look good. Yesterday I saw them against Pakistan and they
look pretty well drilled. They get tired, they have been getting over
injuries, they have to regroup. The only thing that worries me, I will
talk about Petersen, it suggests that within or two things are on
the hoof. The Ashes were so well prepared which is why they need a
good start on Tuesday against the Netherlands. We have spoken about
India and England and Sri Lanka runners up in 2007. We speak to one
of the gym's greatest players.     game. It is known as the pearl of
the Indian Ocean. Opener S eranger went to this school. The main
religion is buoyed his many. After being rebuilt following    Budahism.
The official national sport is volleyball. It is the only host
nation to have ever won the World Cup. New are How are you feeling
about going into this tournament as third favourites? It is good
because I think every them is a favourite in this tournament and it
is going to be an open tournament and we are playing in the normal
crowds so it is a advantage so we have a good side and I think we
will do well. How important is it to start strong in your last ever
World Cup? Yeah, we have to start strong and we have the start well
and that is important because we cannot keep it to qualify.
Qualifying is the most important thing for us so every match is very
serious and we are going to take it very serious and play well.
much of a advantage do you have when Sri Lanka has built to new
stadiums you will not be able the play on? It will not be that much
different because the soil we know and we could play on a pitch good
for batting that will spin a bit and if the bowlers are good enough
we can take wickets. How closely have you been watching Canada?
do not know anything about them but we will play our basic best and we
can beat them. I bet you wish for a result the only other time you have
met Canada 36 all out? Yes, I plaipd in that match and it was
very easy and before 12 o'clock the match was over!    played. And

up trumps in this competition. are weak in the middle order? Do
you agree? They have inform very experienced batsmen who can play if
early wickets fall then attack so I do not think that is too much of a
