There are nearly a million lost and abandoned homes in the UK, waiting for someone
to come along and breathe life back into them.
Whether it is a tired semi, or a rambling mansion, we are on the search for Britain's empty homes.
We're going to show you to spot an empty property,
how they can be got back into use
and how you could turn one possibly into your next dream home.
'Today I'm out to convince a couple of house hunters an empty abode could hold the key
'to their future.'
You can see the house is here. It just needs ideas.
We'll meet the people devoted to getting disused homes back into use.
Because the property looks disused, people think they can use it as a tip.
Abandoned properties tend to slip under the radar for many buyers,
but I'm convinced with the right amount of determination, imagination and hard work,
they can be reborn into glorious homes again.
Cathy and David Simpson have been living in their Victorian flat in south east London
for the last three years.
Since the arrival of little Cameron, though, it's just not big enough.
There is only a half room for our son under the stairs
and we just need some more space.
And Cathy would love a place for the family to grow into.
We're hoping to have at least another brother or sister for Cameron and a puppy for David.
Some chickens and basically have the good life in the country.
Now it's time for them to leave the city behind.
The area that I would like to be move to would preferably have a community spirit,
where we can make an actual home there and become part of that little village.
With so many people wanting to escape the urban sprawl, rural places are in demand,
but I think an empty house could be the solution.
  Good morning, guys, how are you?
  Hi, nice to see you.
Now, then, what are you after?
We'd like a little village where we can get to know everybody and feel part of a community.
And we'd like to have a house that we can have family and friends come and stay as well.
We want more kids as well.
  Well, one more.
  Two.
  You want two more.
  Fine.
  How many bedrooms, ideally?
  Four ish?
  Ideally four.
One for us. Two for the kids and...
  A spare.
  And a spare bedroom, yeah.
  Something old or new or...?
  I prefer old.
I mean, the flat we have now is a Victorian flat in a gorgeous house.
Really big rooms. High ceilings.
  I don't really like new build.
  What about outside space, how important is that?
To me, that's really important. Being Australian, I'm used to having loads of space all around me.
I already grow our own vegetables in London in my little spot.
Well done, gosh.
  So an outback outdoors?
  Yes.
  Really.
Kind of thing. OK. Where exactly in the UK are you thinking of being?
Work is Tunbridge Wells based.
At the moment, I drive an hour and that is quite hard work.
It would be nice to cut that down a fair bit.
And the budget   this is the all important bit   how much do you want to spend on this new endeavour?
I think that's going to depend a lot on how much it's going to cost to do it up.
I guess we're looking at a final price of around 400.
  400 all in?
  450 maybe.
  Stretch it to 450 including purchase and renovation?
  Yes.
OK. Well, let's see what we can find you.
Excellent.
OK, so they are looking for a spacious family home
with four bedrooms a garden with room to grow veg
in a village location in Kent.
All for a total budget of £450,000.
David needs to be within commuting distance of Tunbridge Wells
and I think if they can take on a vacant house, we might just find the answer.
Which is why I have brought them here to a pair   yes, a pair  
of listed thatched cottages just outside the historic village of Aylesford,
only four minutes from Tunbridge Wells.
Just off a country road, they're within walking distance of the village,
which has a pub, and a pretty church.
One of the cottages has been empty for more than four years and the other for three months.
They're being sold together at a guide price of £220,000,
less than half of David and Cathy's £450,000 budget.
All right, let's start with this one.
It's very cute.
What we've got are two little farm workers' cottages.
So the challenge here is to weld the whole lot into one.
But as they stand, they are quite small and they do need an awful lot of renovation.
But if you want a little chocolate box pretty slice of England, you know,
  that's kind of what's on offer. So, what do you think?
  I think it's gorgeous.
  Beautiful.
  It's very gorgeous.
  From my point of view, this is what England's all about, isn't it?
  I thought you might say that.
It is classic slice of Kent countryside, really.
All in all, about a quarter of an acre with it.
So lots of room to expand, which you're going to need.
Price wise, it's on the market for anything between 180 and 220.
For each one or for both?
  No, all in.
  Wow, that's quite cheap.
  Shall we?
  Let's do it.
Each cottage has two small bedrooms a lounge and kitchen, but no bathroom.
With work, they can be knocked into one and extended to create
a fantastic spacious family home with lots of character.
Come on in.
  Come in, Cathy.
  Blimey!
It's quite low.
That is plaster in the extreme.
That's just...
No surprise, it is listed this, Grade II.
So there are issues as to what you can do
with anything that would affect really the fabric of the building.
But the thing to bear in mind it is two old farm workers' cottages
so what we see is exactly mirrored next door.
You are looking at quite an historic number, but you did say character.
Yes, we did. It has got all of that.
  It has got all of that and more.
  But have a look in there.
Check that out.
This is currently... Well, I'm going to call it the kitchen.
You will see what I mean. In you go.
Wow!
  Classic old dairy basin, this.
  Brilliant.
  Does it actually work?
Try.
Wow!
Hey!
  Brown water.
  Brown water, yeah. Fantastic.
'Then it's upstairs to the two bedrooms.'
Come on in. Now, how does it grab you up here?
It's tiny.
Yeah. Tiny. Dark. You could knock that through and make...
You'd have to make this one room.
Realistically, remember what is here is replicated through there.
I mean, I get the sense that, really, yeah, one room here, one room there.
The point is the building as it stands isn't going to be big enough to incorporate a modern family.
It wasn't designed that way and it's not going to work that way.
So the implication is that we do something interesting
at the rear of the property to give you effectively a new build that is attached to this.
That would be amazing.
  It could be pretty special. So, shall we go outside and try and find a bit more space?
  Yes.
  We need to.
  After you, Cathy.
Outside, there's plenty of room for keeping chickens and growing veg.
Plus, there are the cottage's only current bathroom facilities.
It's like at a camp site in Australia.
  That good? Wow!
  Like at home, then?
Yeah! It's got that real homey feel. Bathroom.
Needless to say, all of this goes.
What we're thinking is an entirely new build structure out here
that cleverly links to the old building,
to give you a new dwelling with that attached to it.
As the cottages are listed, this project requires an architect
experienced at dealing with this type of place and who will liaise with the local planning office.
We asked a local one to give us an estimate
for knocking the two cottages into one and adding a double height extension out the back,
giving a large kitchen diner,
two extra bedrooms and an indoor bathroom.
Price wise for these grand plans   this is where it gets quite interesting  
to renovate the existing property,
  we're saying conservatively somewhere in the order of about £80,000.
  Wow.
  The new build, we're suggesting 100,000.
  Really?
  So combined already, it's 180.
And if general fairly generous contingency of say £20,000 on top of the asking price
of upwards of 180 to 220. So potentially,
even if you have to go to 220 to get it, 420 gets you the whole lot.
Which is still comfortably under your 450.
  Yeah.
  Yes.
  How does that sound?
  Well, it...
  It sounds ideal.
  It does, doesn't it?
  If we could get a place to live here,
  but still have the feature at the front, it sounds like the right sort of price.
  Good.
  One on the list?
  It's on the list.
  Yes.
  Good. Right.
Cathy and David don't seem daunted by a renovation project as big as this.
Rescuing a vacant building can take a huge leap of faith, but the pay off, too, can be vast.
When Alice Douglas bought this church in Capel Curig in North Wales
in 1998, she took a bold step into the unknown.
When I came inside, it was just so eerie, it was like a ghost church.
You could make out the hymn books all on the pews, but they had slightly fallen apart.
Obviously, they'd been there for years.
Then I switched the electric on and saw the mosaic
and it was just such a breathtakingly beautiful building,
I just felt that I wanted to make the home I had always dreamt of.
I became like a person possessed that I had to buy it.
Left unused for ten years, Alice snapped up the church for £54,000,
after being told about it by a friend.
I moved here having lived in a one bed flat,
never having done anything more than paint a wall and put up some shelves.
We built a wall by the mosaic and that was our bedroom.
And put one bathroom downstairs and lived like that, really, for six years.
During which time, a complete renovation was carried out,
transforming the church into a family home.
It's a chance to create something very spectacular for yourself
that otherwise you wouldn't have the opportunity to buy, unless you had a lot of money.
The stained glass windows are just beautiful.
The mosaic, I just...
I can sit forever on that sofa reading a book
and just gazing up, looking.
I bought this church for £54,000, I have now got a mortgage
of 370 something thousand and I would guess it is worth about half a million now.
Alice is clear that she was only able to achieve all of this by taking on a derelict building.
I'd never have been able to afford somewhere like this had I not built it myself and done it bit by bit.
So, I've given myself and the kids a fantastic home to live in and enjoy life.
Now it's very likely that in your neighbourhood, there are many empty houses
and it is the job of your local empty property officer to track down absent owners
with a view to getting these places occupied again.
In Exeter, Devon, Sue Haigh heads up a team who cover a 700 square mile area of the county.
Today, she's following up on one of her ongoing cases which is proving problematic.
We've been working with the lady who owns this flat now for about two years.
She has not actually done what she has been promising us she would do,
and, really, we've reached a stage where the neighbours are really starting to complain a lot
about the state of the property and the fact that it is causing them problems.
The council would prefer to work with owners of abandoned buildings to help get them occupied.
Initially, this lady seem to be willing to work with us, but unfortunately that doesn't seem
to have come to fruition and we actually then end up in a situation
where we do actually have to start putting pressure on people, and nobody really wants to do that.
But having said that, the properties just cannot be left in the state
that they are because it is too offensive to the people living around them.
Sue needs to check what progress, if any, has been made
to improve the condition of the ground floor flat since contacting the owner.
When a property gets down as low as this one, if you are not careful,
what happens, particularly where you have got flats,
is if there is anything going wrong in the bottom flat, that that could start to affect the top flat.
We need to find out if there are any problems in there and prevent them from getting any worse.
Now, the flat is attracting anti social behaviour
and is becoming a major worry for neighbours.
We think people have been coming through from the alleyway next to it
and have been dumping here, fly tipping.
Because the property looks disused, people think they can use it as a tip.
We have had more serious incidents where there has been fires lit in the rear garden,
which has become quite frightening for people living around here, obviously.
To proceed with any sort of enforcement on the owner to bring the property back into use,
Sue needs to ensure she gathers evidence.
Thank you very much. Bye.
He did tell me quite a lot about the history of the problems of property
and the fact that they had vagrants sleeping in the back garden.
But they're not happy about the way the property looks and the attention it's getting.
It's been a long running case for Sue and it's got to the stage now
where she needs to take more definite action.
This has now been going on, with various excuses, for two years.
Something has to be done and it may seem harsh to start going down an enforcement route,
but really, we are left with very little alternative.
If you'd like an empty property officer to investigate an abandoned place near you,
then get on the phone to your local council.
Cathy and David Simpson are starting to outgrow their flat in London
and would like to move out to rural Kent.
With a total budget of £450,000, I reckon a vacant house
could become their dream country pile.
Firstly, I showed them two listed cottages in the village of Aylesford,
which were up for sale together for a combined guide price of 220,000.
Well within budget, they had potential to meet all Cathy and David's needs.
Now we're heading to the Kent coast and the seaside town of Broadstairs,
to a large detached, four bedroomed Victorian villa, which has not been lived in for the past three years.
  OK, now this is a lot different to our first property. What do you think?
  It's huge.
  Yes, well, it's an imposing front.
  It is exactly that. It is enormous.
It's Victorian, which I know is of interest to you, and it is full of some interesting features
that are crying out to be brought back to life again.
  That's what we are after.
  Price wise, this could be yours for £190,000.
  Really?
  Is that all?
  Yeah. But there's a lot of work needs doing as well. No surprise there.
  Yes.
  Shall we?
  Yeah, let's do it.
With two large reception rooms, kitchen and four bedrooms,
the house was left to its current owner in a will and is now being sold on.
Right, this is quite interesting.
We'll start in here.
It's huge.
Look at the fireplace!
What is this? What have you brought us to?
  It's another project.
  Hmm, yes.
  Wow.
  He says lightly.
The windows are beautiful.
The windows are one of the real features of this end of the building
and one or two other details. Can you see that little alcove?
That's sweet.
Clearly, this would have had a nice, imposing Victorian fireplace, either iron or slate.
That's gone, but you know, and it's huge.
Come and follow me. You'll see what I mean.
Come through here.
So, you see what I mean?
  It's almost spacious.
  Big.
Yeah. And it goes on.
Whether this is an historic feature, or a recent knock through, I wouldn't like to say.
So much has happened to this place over the years.
But you get the idea that space is one thing it's not short of. Now, then, the kitchen.
Dare we look, after the last kitchen?
It can't be any worse. Cannot be any worse.
Bigger than our earlier one.
  That is for sure.
  Yeah.
  Less spiders.
  It wouldn't be hard.
Yes. As you can see, again, somebody's sort of attempted
to at least, you know, take the kitchen out, whatever was here.
But what's left behind is a right old can of worms.
Off the kitchen is what was once a shower room, but could become a useful utility area.
Then it's upstairs to where there are four bedrooms.
This is one of the four.
  It's big.
  Again, give you an idea of what we have got to play with,
size wise, quite interesting.
It is a good size, isn't it?
In terms of you having something you could grow into
with Cameron and maybe more,
  this is the four beds you were after.
  Definitely.
The detail is interesting.
There's... The doors are all there.
Wow. No.
You're joking!
This is very '70s.
Everyone boarded over these things, bricked up fireplaces and messed around with these houses,
  but that's now the kind of thing we look to restore and bring back to life.
  What a crime.
I think it's got a lot of potential.
It's not like the previous one. It's actually a house,
you can see the house is here, it just needs ideas and electrics and plumbing.
  It is not a complete build.
  This is a classic renovation.
Shall we have a quick look at the garden?
At 200 feet long, it will need some tidying and landscaping,
but offers plenty of potential for a vegetable patch, and there's even room for a chicken coup.
As a town garden, anywhere in the country, this is a good one.
Yeah, definitely.
In terms of the property, there it is, there's the back of it,
I would suggest a sort of slate ridged garden room,
coming right out because all of this has got to go anyway.
  And you've got so much garden.
  Exactly. What does it matter?
That could be beautiful, almost make a whole other room out the back here.
In order to get an idea of costs, we asked a local builder to price up
for a total refurbishment of the place, including replacing the windows, re plastering,
fitting a new kitchen, bathroom and central heating.
To renovate it as it stands, they're saying around about £80,000.
  Is that all?
  Now, it's still 80 grand.
  Yes.
But in the context of giving you a ready to go four bedroomed home with an enormous garden,
I think, that's quite interesting.
  260 all in.
  That's not bad, is it?
Yes, 260, 270 all in.
If you allow another 20, say, for the garden room element if that was of interest,
even so, you're talking worst case, £100,000.
Easy for me to bandy these figures around, but I think that is pretty achievable.
  Yeah, definitely.
  I think you would end up with something quite special
and a good workable family home in which you could grow. One worth considering?
I definitely think so. Well, yeah.
  I think so.
  Mull it over. Come on.
Cathy and David have seen two very different houses which could offer them everything they need.
But are they up to the challenge of taking on either one of them?
We'll find out later on.
Back in Exeter, empty property officer Sue Haigh's following up on one of her ongoing cases
involving a house that's not been lived in for two years.
This is a property that we've been working with for some time now.
It's a family property owned by two daughters who inherited
and they've been wanting to try and bring the property up to standard and let it out.
The house was left to Deborah Hill and her sister when their father died.
They started to renovate it, but ran into problems and contacted Sue and her team for help.
We've seen photographs of the family when they were growing up in this property
and it really does make you feel like you want to help them
and you want to get this property back into use again.
You want that lovely family feel about it that it obviously had originally.
Having grown up here, it holds a lot of fond memories for Deborah.
This was my bedroom.
The second biggest room.
It caused a lot of arguments between me and my sister.
This was my parents' room.
Coming into the house now it's not sad, because we were all so happy here.
But now the family want to bring the house back into use
and obtained a grant from the council to complete the renovation.
One condition of the financial help is the terrace must be let to people on the council's housing list.
  Hi, Amanda.
  Hiya.
Having drawn up an action plan, today Sue is meeting one of her team, Amanda Knight,
to check on the work due to be done at the house.
All the polystyrene tiles will need to come down, and in the hall, because they are a fire risk.
This will be the kitchen. As you can see, along with the bathrooms,
these are the two rooms that need the most work.
So, how long do you think these works are going to take?
I would anticipate, if there aren't any problems, two to three months.
  Right, there is an awful lot of work to do.
  Yes, there is a lot to do.
It's been a long process for Deborah, but finally there's an end in sight.
My mum and dad would be pleased to know that somebody's going to be living there
and making the most of the house.
Breathing new life back into a disused building
can be a fantastic way to create your perfect family home
and that's just what Katie Varney did taking on the listed 16th century Lyttleton farm
in Wiltshire in 2000.
It was really a cold, wet February morning, looking at it its worst, and it was empty, derelict,
but you could just tell that it had great possibilities.
After moving in, Katie and her family started renovating the old farmhouse,
doing the work in stages over nine years.
I knew I wanted stone floors right the way through it
and I knew I wanted quite a lot of wood because of all the lovely beams.
We haven't designed it all to death.
We've kept it quite simple. I think you have to with a house like this.
With the house being listed, the work had to be carried out with careful consideration and planning.
The hardest thing probably in terms of the build was the attic space.
We did have a few issues because initially, they weren't going to let us renovate it
because we wanted to cut through a beam to in order to gain access into the roof space.
But they came back to look at it a second time and agreed that we could.
I always love coming into this kitchen every morning.
I love the light, love the garden.
There's something really, really special about it.
We bought the house for 390,000.
Over the last nine years, we've spent about 150,000.
I would imagine it's worth about 800 to 900,000.
If I had turned the clock back, I would absolutely buy this again.
There might be things that I would do slightly differently, but, no, absolutely, I would do it again.
If you can't wait to get going on the search for your own empty property to rescue,
here is how to start.
Register your interest with estate agents in the area you want to live.
Often they'll not only have vacant houses on their books,
but land for sale, which may have a derelict building on it.
And if a house near you appears unlived in, contact your council's empty property officer.
If the owner is known to them, they could make contact on your behalf to see if they want to sell.
'Today's property hunters, Cathy and David Simpson, wanted to find a family home in rural Kent
'with enough garden space to grow their own veg and a house to grow into with their baby boy, Cameron.
'It also needed to be close to Tunbridge Wells, where David's work is based.
'They've seen two very different houses, well within their 450 grand budget.
'But has either place persuaded Cathy and David a vacant house is the right choice for them?'
  Well, I'm afraid our property search is now at an end.
  Oh, shame!
  You want to do it all again?
  Yeah, it was fun.
Is it a surprise to you, coming from Australia,
in terms of the sort of properties we've been able to show you?
Definitely. I mean, I fell in love with the first property because of its charm, I guess.
It's like a postcard house.
It was, as you say, a classic kind of image
of a picture postcard   thatched, two little cottages, which you had the opportunity to turn into one.
What are you thinking about that one now you've had time to reflect on it?
We like it. We're going to get a plan to join the house at the back
in with the house at the front so it was one thing.
So we're going talk to the architect and see what can be done.
What about property number two, in Broadstairs?
A bit further away than what you ideally wanted, but nonetheless one worth seeing, I think.
Totally, yes. I mean, a beautiful house.
When that was built, it was superb.
Now it's just sad. But it needs love.
The area's beautiful, but it's just too far from where David's work is going to be based,
which is a real shame, because that's got a lot of potential as well.
So we're left with property number one, which you are thinking about.
  Are you going to talk to the architect?
  Definitely.
  I think so.
  So, good luck.
  Thank you.
  Good luck.
Having glimpsed the potential that many empty properties have on offer,
it's very hard to resist their allure, but I think that's the fun of it.
It's all about taking time to explore what's out there
before you finally find the one that's right for you.
