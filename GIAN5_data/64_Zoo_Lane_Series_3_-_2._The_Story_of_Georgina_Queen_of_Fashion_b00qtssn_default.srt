Hello! I'm Lucy.
I live at 64 Zoo Lane and I have some very special neighbours. Look!
There's one with a hump And one who can jump
And one who is a little bit plump
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Some like it hot Some like it chilly
Some like it both ways That's a bit silly
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Some are friendly, some are scary
But one thing is sure, not one is ordinary
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
They're prickly and woolly and furry and slimy
Some are quite big Some are very small
And the last one's Georgina
Who's incredibly tall

Bedtime, Lucy!
OK, Mum!
Hello, Lucy!
My, my! You do look glum today.
It's these pyjamas.
But we love your pyjamas!
You look very nice in them.
Well, I don't want to wear them!
Why not? Are they too tight?
No.
Are they too loose?
No, they're unfashionable.
Unfashionable?
My friend Yasmine wears pink pyjamas.
Robyn wears purple ones with yellow flowers.
I don't want to wear these old blue pyjamas any more!
But they suit you!
Nobody else wears blue pyjamas!
Sometimes it's good to be fashionable
and sometimes it's good to be yourself.
Good to be yourself?
Georgina should know.
She was the Fashion Queen of Africa.
She was?
Oh, please tell me about it!
'Every morning, Georgina the Giraffe woke up especially early
'to enjoy a big breakfast of juicy leaves.'
Yum yum yum Going to fill my tum
With yummy yum leaves today
I need to eat a lot cos my neck's so long
And my tummy's so far away. Boo!
Morning, Herbert.
Morning, Georgina.
  Would you like some leaves?
  No! Yuck! No! Not for me! Eww!
I'm having some nice slimy worms
and a yummy lump of mud for my breakfast.
And a muddy potato. And, er...
Ooh! Well, I must say, your new hat suits you!
What hat?
Oh!
Quite the fashion, I would say.
Fashion?
Oh... Yes, I suppose so!
Oh, er, well... I must be on my way.
Lots of slimy worms to swallow.
Oh!
I DO look fashionable.
Wow!
I don't know how you do it!
  Do what?
  You know!
Look so fabulous all the time!
Oh, you mean my hat!
Oh, yes, everyone will be wearing one soon!
Herbert says hats are, um, "fashionable".
Fashionable?
'Later that morning,
'when the animals gathered for a drink at the water hole...'
Yoo hoo!
It's Georgina!
Wow, she looks fabulous!
Don't you just love my hat?
It's SO you!
I must have one!
I must have one!
I am Georgina, Queen of Fashion!
'Soon, every animal on the savanna was making a hat!'
Cool hat!
Mmm. A...
Whoa!
Hello, everyone!
Gather round,
gather round!
Ahem!
HE HUMS Nelson! We're waiting!
Are you? Oh!
Everyone who is anyone seems to be wearing a hat nowadays,
so we're going to stage a fashion show tonight!
Yay!
I am going to be wearing
the most bestest hat in all of Africa!
'All the animals and birds were very busy.'
Oh!
'Even Nelson made a special hat!'
Do my ears look big in this?
Oh, no, you look very fashionable!
Yay!
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to tonight's fashion extravaganza!
And our first model is Nelson the Elephant
in a fantastic little number  
a hard hat featuring Toby the Tortoise
and Doris the Duck with her yellow feathers!
Yay!
And now, Zed in his banana bandana!
And here's Natalie!
'The hats were uncomfortable and looked rather silly
'but none of the animals dared say anything.'
And now, here is Molly the Hippo in a colourful crown!
I need just one more piece of fruit for my bestest hat.
SHE CHUCKLES A ha!
Eh, can't reach...
And here's Audrey in her feather hat!
Excuse me, but you're standing on my hat!
Sorry, Nat!
  Ooh!
  Ooh!
  Oh, watch out!
Ooh! Oh!
Ouch! Ooh! Oh!
Oh! Ow!
Oh, dear! Someone's going to get hurt!
Hello, Herbert!
Do you like my hat?
Like it? Why, it was delicious!
Eek! My bestest hat!
My reputation, eaten by a warthog!
What have you done, Herbert? What...have...you...done?
Don't worry. It was too big, anyway.
SHE SOBS Too big?
Don't worry. I've got an idea. Listen.
What we do is...
And now, the lady you've all been waiting for,
Georgina, Queen of Fashion!
Hmmm! No hat?
It's the NEW fashion!
She's wearing earrings!
They are so chic!
And better still, very comfortable!
It's good to be fashionable now and then
but it's much better to be yourself!
I've written a song about it.
Oh! Can we join in?
Of course.
Fashion is fine but you can't wear it all the time
It's good to be yourself
If things go wrong Just sing this little song
It's good to be yourself
Hip hooray, hip hip hooray
It's good to be yourself
Fashion is fine
But you can't wear it all the time So it's good to be yourself.
And that's how Georgina
became Fashion Queen of Africa.
So, Lucy...
  are you in fashion?
  Or not?
Fashion changes so quickly, I just don't know.
A little bird told me that blue pyjamas will be in fashion tomorrow!
They will?
Yasmine's mum bought some blue pyjamas today!
  She did?
  Because Yasmine thinks YOU'RE fashionable!
  Brilliant!
Something else is in fashion now!
What's that?
Sleep! Everyone's tired and ready for bed.
Oh! Sweet dreams, everyone!
Sweet dreams, Lucy!
