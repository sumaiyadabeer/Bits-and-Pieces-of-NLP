  It's MasterChef.
  I don't think anyone wants this as much as I do.
Searching for Britain's best amateur cook.
I'm here for a place in the semi finals.
136 contestants who all believe they have undiscovered talent.
I just think, "Bring it on."
Whoever wins, it'll change their life.
Cooking doesn't get tougher than this.
It's quarter final day and the five heat winners are back.
Stuart.
Roz, Dhruv are both quarter finalists.
Jo, Amy, you are both quarter finalists.
They return to fight for a coveted place in the semi finals.
There's absolutely no room for small errors and mistakes.
The standards have to be raised today. The bar's been moved up.
I desperately want a place in the semi finals.
It's do or die. I want to come back and do some more.
I want to win it. Of course I want to win it.
I've got to stay calm and see how far I can go.
I've never wanted anything
as much ever in my entire life as I want to win this competition now.
These quarter finalists need to show they can build on the good start that they've had.
This is serious pressure.
If they want to be a semi finalist, they have to cook for their lives.
In this, the first of the tests,
the five heat winners must show John and Gregg they have both the skill and commitment
to make it as a semi finalist.
After this, only the best cooks will go through.
We want our amateur cooks to succeed, so we give them a choice  
either a fish recipe or a meat recipe.
The fish recipe is home made fish fingers and tartare sauce.
There is a secret to fish fingers.
You have to cut the fish against the grain or it will fall apart.
And make a tartare sauce rich with capers, gherkins and balanced well with parsley and lemon juice.
Our meat recipe is a pan fried pork chop and classic apple sauce.
Overcook a piece of pork and it becomes dry and chalky. Undercook it and it becomes like jelly.
The apple sauce has to be sharp, but also a bit sweet, so it goes well with the meat.
I like this test because it's about their base knowledge and their skills. There's nowhere to hide.
First up is sales director Dhruv.
After becoming a dad for the first time,
he now wants to pursue a career in food.
In the heats, he wowed the judges with some great cooking.
That cake is so full of all the flavours that I love.
But there have also been some basic errors.
All the flavours just get washed away by that watery spinach.
This means the world to me. It's the chance to have a dream job, to turn my passion into my career.
We have for you either a fish recipe or a meat recipe.
I think I will try the fish recipe.
We are going to give you a maximum of 15 minutes
to make for us fish fingers with tartare sauce.
I think I've got to show John and Gregg that I'm worthy of a place in the semi finals.
I've ultimately got to show them I'm worthy of winning this competition.
Lovely crispness on the outside, the fish still translucent inside and soft,
  but cooked and falling apart in flakes. Very good indeed.
  Thank you.
  You have a perfect fish finger. Your tartare sauce is creamy, yet still sharp.
  Thank you.
Can you tell me, Dhruv, why it's important to you to go through?
I've got this dream of owning a small restaurant/pub with a bit of land, growing my own veg, herbs and fruit.
MasterChef is a step in the right direction to give me the opportunity towards that dream.
I'm feeling fantastic. The comments couldn't have been any better and I'm absolutely delighted.
When I allow myself to think where this could lead, I do get quite choked up, actually.
Next up is 28 year old Roz who dreams of owning her own cafe in Devon.
She has shown real talent with her fusion style food.
  Like the filling, like the sauce. Good flavours that you associate with south east Asia.
  Thank you.
But sometimes she can overdo it.
The sweet scallop with the sharp passion fruit is a real treat.
I don't like the salty samphire with it.
If I got through today, the cafe would... It's almost tangible. I can almost feel it.
A fish recipe or a meat recipe?
I think I'm going to cook a meat recipe.
A perfectly pan fried pork chop with apple sauce.
You've had ten minutes. You've still got five.
No, I like my pork pink.
It's a little bit under.
Your apple sauce has a really lovely flavour,
but that pork chop needs more time and it needed to be seasoned.
  You had another five minutes. You could have left it in the pan.
  Yeah, I know.
Tell me what food means to you and what MasterChef would mean to you.
Food means to me pretty much everything and MasterChef is just so important to me
because it will enable me, hopefully, to be able to share that with other people.
I want people in Devon to know what people in Japan and Australia eat.
I'm feeling quite deflated.
I knew that I hadn't cooked the chop properly.
I just feel a bit stupid because I make things like that all the time at home.
Mum of three Jo dreams of running her own country house hotel.
In her heat, she proved she had a good palate.
  Very unusual combination, but it works perfectly well.
  Good.
But she doesn't always get it right.
The orange rind is a mistake.
I'm not competitive, but here it's just brought out this competitive edge in me.
I'd be absolutely gutted if I went home today.
  What would you like to cook?
  Fish.
  Let's go.
Just calm yourself down.
From what I thought was going to be a really flawed start, we've got two fish fingers on a plate.
Your fish fingers are breaking up because all they have on the outside is egg and breadcrumb.
They need the flour around the outside first to mix with the egg, then your breadcrumb on the outside.
  But I'm pleased that we've got something on a plate.
  Good. That's positive.
What I want to know now is your passion for food.
I've decided already from going in the professional kitchen that's where I want to be, it's what I want to do.
I got a huge buzz from that. I didn't want to leave. I just want to be up there.
And I need all that knowledge to be able to get there.
I eat so much fish, I cook so much fish.
But if you can't blooming make a fish finger...
there's not a lot of hope really, is there?
Legal project manager Amy impressed in her heat with technical skill.
Your pasta is perfect and paper thin.
  I think it's very, very good.
  Thank you.
But not everything went to plan.
It's looking more like underdone cake than the ooziness that needs to come from a fondant.
When I'm cooking, I'm in my element because I love how it brings joy to me, then brings joy to others.
I'm a very passionate cook.
  Which one would you like to cook?
  The fish.
What I need to prove to John and Gregg is how much this means to me.
Doing well today could change my life.
Your fish cooked for a very long time and it started to fall apart
because of the way you cut the fish.
You've got to cut it against the grain, so it holds in a block.
They should be crispier, they shouldn't be falling apart and your fish is overcooked.
Cooking to me is just a passion. I think about it before I go to bed.
I wake up thinking about food. It's something that I want to turn into a career.
I'm a little bit disappointed with how my fish fingers went.
I'm wishing I could do that again, but, you know...
Last up is Glasgow based Stuart who wants to train with Michelin star chefs.
Lovely lamb. Salty crust. Absolutely lovely.
But he can add too many elements to his dishes.
Once you hit the orange segment with that sea bass, the fish can't be found anywhere.
I would rather at least try and fail than just accept safety in defeat.
I'd hate to think I could have pushed the boat out and maybe won.
  I'm going to go with the fish.
  Let's cook.
Nice, crispy coating around the fish. Well seasoned, well thought about.
I quite like what you've done.
You have a crispy outside and soft fish inside. You should be quite pleased with yourself.
  Thanks.
  Tell me, please, what MasterChef would mean to you.
Every day I'm not working, I'm in the kitchen. It's got beyond just a hobby.
It would be great to have a profession that I really loved. That would be it for me.
I feel OK. It didn't go so badly.
It's not something I've made that often before, or ever, fish fingers.
That was a great exercise from a judge's point of view. It shows what their basic skills are like.
  We've got to make a decision.
  One person stood out who really had a fantastic round.
  That is Dhruv.
  Lovely fish fingers, good tartare sauce and presented beautifully.
He knew exactly what he was doing. Dhruv stays for sure.
  I like Stuart.
  Stuart did very, very well.
Big fish fingers, crispy on the outside, nice little tartare sauce. Yeah, not bad.
So Stuart stays and so does Dhruv.
Jo is really passionate about food.
  But she was not confident in what she was doing.
  She crumbled under the pressure.
Amy, in my mind, what she did was just not right.
The fish was overcooked, cut with the grain, rather than against the grain. A lot of mistakes from Amy.
Roz made a really nice apple sauce   sharp with a little bit of sweetness.
But she didn't cook her pork for long enough.
Neither did she season it.
We can only take the best cooks through.
Who has got what it takes?
A tough decision
and one of you is leaving us.
The person leaving us...
  ..is Amy.
  Thank you.
I'm feeling kind of... well, sad really.
I'm going to be reliving the fish fingers for a long time to come.
Well done.
Ladies and gentlemen, one semi final place up for grabs. You must cook like you've never cooked before.
You have one hour and you are going to cook just one dish. Let's cook.
With only one dish to secure a place in the semi finals, these four now have to cook to perfection.
  How are you feeling, Jo?
  Good. I feel really pleased to be here.
I thought I'd blown it on those fish fingers. I was working out my journey home.
  What are you going to cook for us?
  Pigeon breast on a potato rosti
with a juniper berry, Madeira and beetroot sauce.
  Mm hm.
  It's quite simple ingredients, but simple ingredients can taste fantastic
and I want you to think, "Wow, I want to eat that!"
Jo's pigeon on rosti with a Madeira sauce is something I would most certainly order in a restaurant.
But that rosti needs to be crisp. With a sauce on it, will it be soggy and awful and damp?
I'm doing a pan roasted duck breast fillet with a pickled carrot puree and a spiced plum sauce.
It's quite a difficult dish, but it's one of my favourites.
We are talking presently about 20 different herbs and spices.
Now, that is a gifted cook who can balance all those. Why are you taking such a risk at this stage?
I deliberated long and hard about it and I think now is the time to do something to really impress you
and give you no hesitation or doubt to put me through.
Dhruv has measured up the competition and the guy is going all guns blazing.
20 herbs and spices   does he have the talent to balance that many flavours?
What on earth is it going to taste like?
You've had 25 minutes. We're nearly halfway.
  Roz, what are you cooking for us?
  A kind of take on sashimi tuna with a lemongrass pesto cooking broth.
You can cook the tuna some more in the broth if you want to or eat it as it is.
I've made this dish a lot of times and I've had mistakes with the chilli before,
so I think I've got it to a level now where the flavours just really complement each other.
Roz is staying with her experimental Asian flavours.
She's got Japanese tuna, Vietnamese pickled vegetables and Korean broth. Wow!
Can she make those three big cultural flavours come together in harmony?
Stuart, what are you going to cook for us?
Some John Dory with potato rosti, cabbage, bacon and peas and a butter and tarragon sauce.
I'm taking a simple concept, but I've refined it, so that it's not rustic.
How far do you want to go in your culinary life?
I need to learn at the top level. Cooking good food, keeping it consistent, is where I need to be.
John Dory, crispy rosti, peas and cabbage and then mushrooms and a tarragon butter sauce.
Oh, there is so much going on on that plate, it's in danger of tipping over the edge.
You've got under four minutes.
That's it, time's up. Step away. Time's up.
Glasgow based Stuart has made John Dory on a potato rosti
with cabbage, mushrooms, peas and pancetta, but he hasn't served his tarragon beurre blanc sauce.
Stuart, are you OK?
No. It was a disaster really. The sauce split.
The rosti was looking fantastic at one point, then it went over. It was about as bad as I've cooked.
I'm disappointed for you.
The rosti is burnt, the fish is too firm.
It's a shame because there is the foundation of a beautiful dish there, Stuart. I'm sorry for you.
That little pile sitting underneath that fish is really delicious,
  but there are so many mistakes on here, it's very difficult to say much more.
  I'm absolutely gutted.
New dad Dhruv is hoping he's got the balance right
with his pan roasted duck breast, pickled carrot puree, pilau rice and spiced plum sauce.
It looks beautiful. It tastes beautiful.
Perfectly cooked duck, really lovely sweet plum against the sweet carrot.
All those bits of black cardamom and cumin,
then a bit of sourness and sharpness to take the whole thing off. It is very, very, very good indeed.
  Dhruv, do you think your rice is cooked properly?
  Nope.
If there is fault to be found, Dhruv, your rice is undercooked.
I taste hundreds of plates of food. Rarely do I taste something as complex, yet as elegant.
Thank you.
Mum of three Jo has made pigeon breast
with potato rosti, buttered cabbage, beetroot and a Madeira and juniper berry sauce.
Your pigeon is cooked perfectly and it goes beautifully with your sweet sauce.
But then it gets soaked up by this fried rosti,
so all the work of pan frying something, making it a lovely and crispy potato cake,
  becomes this soggy cake.
  Hmm.
The iron richness of that pigeon with that sweet Madeira sauce is lovely.
More earthy sweetness with the beetroot. I love that. I absolutely love the flavours there.
Has fusion cook Roz successfully blended three different cultures
with her sashimi tuna on carrot and beansprout salad and a lemongrass and pesto cooking broth?
The flavours are extraordinary.
The lemongrass is strong and pungent and very citrussy,
then a little bit of iron richness that comes from your tuna soaked in soy sauce.
  I like it.
  Thank you.
  I like it a lot, but I would love a lot more spice, chilli heat.
I like your food. It's different food, it's exciting food.
Well done, guys.
I'm so impressed with these four.
Really, really impressed. I've had such a lovely time tasting.
The style of the food, the skill shown, was seriously impressive.
It has to be said Stuart did make loads of mistakes which is a real shame
because he had designed a championship dish, he really had.
The fish was overcooked, we didn't get a sauce that was promised and the rosti was burnt.
  At this level, you must deliver.
  Stuart's gone.
I couldn't stay focused. I started thinking too much about the competition
and too much about if I could win it or not.
It leaves us three people to talk about, three very, very good cooks.
Dhruv is so impressive. I mean, the dish looked fantastic.
And those flavours, John!
The idea of balancing sweet plum, pickled carrot, duck and rice,
adding to that 20 different herbs and spices, and everything to come along in harmony, is a real feat.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the comments could have been that good.
They completely shocked me.
But Dhruv will be kicking himself about not cooking his rice properly.
I really like Roz's food.
It looks elegant, it looks stylish. It had great flavours going on there.
Roz is a truly inventive cook who is able to deliver what I call proper fusion food.
That broth, the depth from the lemongrass, the richness of the coriander and a hint of chilli.
Not enough chilli. It needed that heat to take it up one more level.
I am really proud of the fact that I cooked it how I wanted to cook it and that they liked it.
That was excellent. I'm really proud of myself.
Jo had a lot to prove after her fish fingers today and she did prove it.
That pigeon was cooked to perfection and I just loved that Madeira sauce.
The issue was the texture of that rosti. It soaked up all the sauce.
But still very, very good cooking.
I'm desperate now to go through
and I don't think I'll feel satisfied and totally happy in myself until I have won it.
Today, the food that's been cooked in this room is fantastic.
How do you choose one winner when you've just had delicious dish after delicious dish after delicious dish?
How do you choose from that?
Our semi finalist...
..is Dhruv.
Obviously, I'm gutted, but the dream is always going to be there of having a little cafe
and just being able to share my food with people.
I am disappointed. I just don't think I prepared enough and it wasn't my day.
I didn't want the journey to end,
but it's given me the direction that I needed to go on to have a career in cooking.
  'Hello?'
  Menki?
  'Yeah?'
  Hello there.
  'Hi.'
I'm through. EXCITED SHOUTS
It's just waves and waves of just amazing emotion.
  Thank you.
  Congratulations. Semi finalist!
Thank you very, very much.
It just means the absolute world to me.
I've always wanted to go all the way and now I believe I can.
