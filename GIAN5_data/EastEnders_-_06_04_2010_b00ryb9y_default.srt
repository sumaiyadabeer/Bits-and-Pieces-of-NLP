Would you rather him sign up
for the Armed Robbery Youth Training Scheme?
You can't have it both ways.
Judy Marris.
Who's Judy Marris?Lived round the corner from us in Balham.
About my age. Nice woman, intelligent woman.
Her son, Stephan, joined the Army, must be three years ago.
Came out before Christmas last year,
one arm gone and half his face missing. Now all he says is...
Well, no one's saying it don't involve risk.
I'm not putting him through it!
It's only luck that Billie's not in prison, Carol.
You need to speak to Judy Marris about that war! It's going to make a man of him.
How can you sit there and come out with stuff like...?
What...?Our brother is lying in hospital with a bullet in his head!
And what has that got to do with anything?Violence!
I mean, it hasn't exactly made a man of Jack, has it?
If it was your son...
Oh, right. You always liked fighting dirty, Carol.
It's the fighting I'm against, we don't know the half of it!
It never even gets in the papers.
Carol, don't. You don't read the papers!
D'you know, if people knew, there'd be a revolution.
You're talking cobblers.You want to go and speak to Judy Marris...
You all right? Come on, let's go.
Any more news about Jack?
They've put him in a coma which is where I'd quite like to be.
But he's going to be OK?
Well, I'm sure we'll find out soon.
Right. Well, you still set on this Army thing?
Look, lets just talk about it in the caff, shall we?
So, self destruct, did it?
Got fed up being a microwave, blew itself up hoping to come back as a toaster next time?
Will you get that?Get a new one out the catalogue for 50 quid!
Why didn't you tell me? We could have blown one up every day!
So which one of you was it?
Cos I won't get a straight answer out of her.
No comment.Oh, what? You want to call your brief now, do you?
Well, it's coming out your pocket money, both of you!
What pocket money?
You and madam will be cooking tonight, because without the microwave I'm lost.
Too weird.What is?
Addressed to me. Like they knew. So, what are you saying?
You've got your bunny,
but we still ain't got the microwave, and that's all right, then?
Who's it from?Doesn't say. I think I can guess.
Who'd have thought?
What can I get you?
Bacon sandwich and a cup of tea.
Go easy on the milk.
What?
When you remember the magic word, I might remember your bacon sandwich.
Here you go, it's on Ian cos I am so proud of my little brother.
Why is it anyone who's ever been important to me just...
ends up leaving me?
Tamwar, stop it.
What's this?A camera?
Where did it come from?
Internet auction.Tamwar?
Twelve point two megapixels, optical zoom, three inch LCD.
We're talking techno geek heaven here.
How much?Bargain.Tamwar?
It's my money.
You know Auntie Bushra was boasting about that camera?
Yes, what about it?
It was getting on your nerves cos she wouldn't shut up?So?
This one's five times better than that.
Really? Let me see.
Don't touch my precious.
Did you buy that to take pictures of Kamil?
Yep, that was the idea.
Great, then I'll get him from the pram.Not yet, I've got to set it up.
It takes ages and the battery's got to charge up.
OK. Lunchtime, family portrait. You wear your best shalwar kameez.
And you... You! I want you in that purple outfit of yours,
it will match well with my mint.
We can print the picture and send it to Bushra!
Why aren't you at work? Roxy asked me to change my day off.
I'm going to the Unit later to meet Syed, keep him company.
Well, you could at least get dressed. I mean, what would Syed say if he saw you like that, huh?
Come on, do housework, learn to cook.
LETTERBOX SQUEAKING That'll be your father. Masood!
Why did you have to mention Bushra?
To get her off my back.
This cost me two hundred quid, she'd do her nut.
Where did you get that kind of money from?
There's this thing called saving.
It's probably a new word to you.
Tamwar!
Didn't we have family photos taken at the wedding?
Yes, but there was no Kamil then, was there?
And I was the size of a house. Anyway, Tamwar's taking everything
with his brand new camera with the mega pixies and everything.
Why do you insist on putting this rubbish through the door
when you know full well that it goes into the recycling?
Because it's the law and I might lose my job.
Hello?So?
Well, who's writing her letters?
Ask and you might find out. You're really holding me up.
OK, listen, don't forget lunchtime. Best bib and tucker!
For you.Oh!
Anyone we know?
Sorry?The letter?
What about it?Anything interesting?
Hmm, fairly.Yeah?
Huh! Oh, is that the time? I really should be getting dressed.
She did that on purpose.
Just relax.I bet it's not anything important,
I bet it's a dental appointment or something. She did that to upset me.
Mum, maybe you should be less nosey.
You!What?Watch it.
Maybe they won't let him go near any fighting.
Why d'you say that?Well, I assume they want to win, don't they?
He knows I'm only joking. Don't you?
You know Mum's ape? She goes ape about everything.
You're saying if Liam wanted to join up, you'd be all right with that?
Probably, yeah.Well, I wouldn't.
Whit, how many decent jobs are there out there?
That's not the point.
All right, how many GCSEs have you got, Bill? See? Exactly.
This way he can learn a trade  
a mechanic, electrician, something like that.
And by the time he gets home, whenever, things will have picked up
and you'll be all set, won't you, babe?
That's the plan.
Or would you rather him sign on, get in more trouble and be on drugs and that, eh?
Oh, there you are. Why's your phone switched off?
Why d'you think?
You'd better come with me and have a proper talk.
A proper lecture, you mean.
You can have your say and I'll have mine, and then we'll see who's right. Mum! He's 21.
And you think that's old enough to make a decision like this?
Come on. Now.
You're a dark horse.
Watch it, I've just washed that, thank you.
Who'd have thought, eh? What?How did you know?
About what?You KNOW what.Do I?
Wasn't you that left the present on the doorstep this morning?
Maybe.How dumb am I? Hang on, what present?
Where is she?
Baby stuff.
I wish you'd taken a photo of her face when I opened this letter.
So, what is it? Can you keep a secret?
What's it worth?It's not like I'm not going to tell her eventually,
I'm just going to wait for the right moment.
Yeah, so come on.Promise?
I promise.
Blimey.You do savings, I do windfalls.
Windfalls is much better.
Hmm. Um, what are you going to do with that?
I dunno, I need to speak to Syed.
But first, can I borrow a piece of paper and a pen?
Where's your mum now?
Gone to get something from Granddad's.Like what?
Dunno, but it's the motorbike all over again.Eh?
You ain't heard about when I got a 250 behind her back?
Yeah, I do remember her going spare. You were too young, weren't you?
Didn't it get nicked after a week or something?
And that was the end of that.
But you still got the moped.Exactly.
And don't I feel a tit every time I'm on it.
Listen, Billie, d'you want my advice?Go on.
Trying to stop your mum in full flow is like trying to plug a volcano with a cork, all right?
You've got to let her rant. Sooner or later she'll fizzle out.
And that, my son, is when you make your move.
Listen, you come through this, I think you've got her cracked.
The Taliban, they ain't got nothing on my sister.
I need this room, Max, do you mind?
No, it's your house.It's important. It's all right, I'm just going.
I'm going to go see our brother in hospital. You might want to think about your priorities.
That was a cheap shot, Max.It was a cheap shot you threw at me.
Right, sit down and pay attention.
A chocolate rabbit?Plain, though.
I don't like plain.What, and it was just left on the front step?
She thought it was from you.
Do I look like a guy that would get a girl a chocolate rabbit?
She wanted to think so.
Did you see who it was?
Actually, I did.Yeah?
Yeah, he come down on a rope ladder hanging from the helicopter,
shimmied down the drainpipe, cut through the barbed wire,
left the chocolate rabbit, jumped on his speedboat and was off.
Didn't see his face.When did you become a cheeky little sod?
You jealous?Jealous?
No, jealousy's for saddos.
Any idea who that might be?
That's James William Branning, your great great grandfather.
My dad, your grandfather, is named after him.
Born the 12th of December, 1876.
And here he is again on his wedding day.
The 2nd of January, 1897, which means he'd have been, what?
Just turned 20. Had to marry her cos he got her pregnant.
That's what you did in those days.
So that's my great great grandma?Mmm.
And here he is again...
with his regiment, the Royal West Surrey Regiment,
March, 1897, just two months after he's got married.
Any idea why this picture might have been taken?
Cos they were just about to go on their first tour of duty.
And do you know where it was?
Afghanistan.
Right.And here...
only, you can hardly read it, it's that small,
"Private James Branning of the 1st Battalion, the West Surrey Regiment,
"died from wounds received at Garappa, aged 20,
"for Queen and country."
And this...
This is the baby he never knew,
your grandfather's father...
All right, Mu... ..your great granddad.
What's this got to do with me?He was a year younger than you are now.
Clearly not as good looking.
Remember Judy Marris who used to live round the corner?
Mum, I know what happened to her son.
Yeah, well, she's a very angry woman.
Go and talk to her. Now listen, I'd say talk to Stephan,
only he can hardly speak cos he's had his mouth shot away.
Mum, it's a war, all right? And bad things happen in wars.
That is exactly what I'm saying, Billie.
Mum, stop going on like you know!
Judy does and I've spoken to her. She's read up on it,
she knows all about it. So what, eh?
We let the terrorists win? Is that what you want?
It's not about terrorists. So why are we there, then?
According to Judy, it's about...No, Mum!
She's angry and she's got a right, but when you're angry, you ain't thinking straight.
If we don't fight over there, we going to fight them on High St? It's about oil. Oil and gas.
Stop going on like you know everything!
Judy does! I'm not having my son killed just to keep my gas bill down.
Mum, it's about protecting our way of life.
Where did you pick that up from?
I tell you, the politicians that come out with that garbage...
Why aren't they sending THEIR sons to do the dying?
There is a word for young working class boys like you who they get to join up. D'you know what it is?
It's cannon fodder!
CRASH Why?
Everything I've ever wanted to do,
why d'you always put the mockers on it?
I beg your pardon? Go on, think about it.
What? Like the time I caught you smoking when you were 13?
Or the vodka in the bedside table?
Yeah, well I really am a bad mother, aren't I?Or the motorbike?
After what you did?
D'you know, I think I was amazing even letting you have a moped.
No. No, I wanted a motorbike!
But, no! you had to sit me down and make me watch that programme.
On and on about how 17 year olds always die in motorbike accidents.
It did my head in!And you're still here, that's a result.
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I don't want you holding my hand? That I want to grow up?
That I want to live my life?You see that is the whole point, Billie.
See, I want you to live your life. As in "live"!
Are we sure we want to rush?
I can't do a thing right, she criticises everything.
What did she say when you told her?I haven't.Why not?
Because I wanted to tell you first. Well, that's not strictly true.
She was so getting on my nerves and so desperate to know,
that I just wanted to punish her.
Actually, I've done a bit of a wicked thing.
What kind of wicked thing?
Amira?
Right, I've finally managed to get him down.
That should buy us a couple of hours.
How much longer are you going to be fiddling with that thing?
Digital technology offers the true geek limitless infinities of fiddling, worlds within worlds,
whole universes hidden away behind the word "preferences".
Why do I even ask?
Amira's left her... Her book behind.
Maybe I'll pop down to the Unit later and hand it to her.
"Anyone who reads this should really learn to mind their own busi..."
(I'm going to kill her!)
On second thoughts, maybe not such a good idea to go down.
You know, she'll be very busy.
Probably left it here on purpose.
No, there's no change at all.
But you can't really expect any, can you?
What d'you do, you know, when you're with him?
Just talk about what's happening.
Dunno how much of it gets through.
Are you going soon?Yeah, yeah.
I might pop up this afternoon if I get a chance.
You might want to take Amy.
I mean, you never know, it might make a difference.
Why don't you want to go and visit Jack?
Who says I don't?
I...don't suppose you know if Ronnie's been again, do you?
Well, call her.
You were telling me about this romance business.
Means to an end, nothing more. I understand the chocolate.
Chocolate's nice, I get that. But what's with the rabbit?
Why not buy an ordinary bar?
You're paying five times the price for the same amount.
It don't make sense.
You've got to get inside a woman's mind.
You're talking darkest Borneo.
Why can't they like us for the way we are?
The way we are? If they knew that, we'd be stuffed, wouldn't we?
He can do what he likes, he's 21. Tell that to Carol.
The Army'll make a much better job of him than she has.
I can, sort of, see her point.
Wars ARE dangerous.Yes, well, what if people had said that in 1939?
That's a good point, Dot.
You don't think I wasn't scared when Grant went to the Falklands?
But you stuck by him, didn't you? You did your duty.
You put your feelings to one side when there's principles at stake.
But I'll never forget the day I saw the pictures of that flag flying over Port Stanley...
and the thought that my son had played a part in all that.
You must be very proud.
Yeah."To everything there is a season...
"A time to love and a time to hate. A time of war and a time of peace."
Ecclesiastes   chapter three, verse eight.
I wish there'd still been National Service when my Nick was 18.
Now, young Billie, he has heard the trumpet sound, and he's answered the call.
Not if Carol locks him in the cupboard, he ain't.
You know what we should do if the boy needs a bit of encouragement and support?
What's that?
Roxy! I've got an idea.
Have you not moved from that spot all morning?No.
Which means I've been witness to everything in this room.She didn't?
She did.You SAW her?Yeah.
Went into the kitchen, came back a minute later not happy.
And did she say anything?
She's going to be angry. How can she? That'd mean admitting what she'd done.
Oh...Just to warn you,
your mum's having second thoughts about the photo.What?
Oh, no! No, no! She can't!
Syed's already getting changed.
Let ME have a word.
What?Nothing.
Mum, what's this Dad says about no photo?
No, I thought about what he said.
We've got enough from the wedding, OK?
And the weather's not looking cheerful, Amira.
Oh, but Tam wants to try out his new camera,
he's going to be really disappointed.
And what about little Kamil? And Syed's already getting changed.
Yeah, just go ahead and do this without me, I've got work to do.
Anyone would think you're trying to avoid me.
I'll look after Kamil, you go get changed.
No, no...Yeah, yeah!
You wear the mint, remember?
Cos I'm going to be in the purple. OK. Fine, then.
Oh, Mum... have you seen my book anywhere?Book? What... What book?
Oh, I think I left it in the living room.
For the lady.Lady?
As a token of my... Whatever, there you are.What's brought this on?
Well, it's not just Mr Chocolate Bunny Rabbit Pants
that can do romance. Here y'are...two bunches.
What?Well, I was going to get you roses,
but then I saw tulips   "buy one, get one free", so no contest.
I really don't know what to say.
I've got one or two suggestions  
"Wait there, I'll turn on the electric blanket,
"Grab a beer, I'll put on my pulling pants,
"Do you like it with the light on or off?"
Unbelievable.Answer   on.
Wait, I was being funny, it was a joke.
I like to laugh a girl into bed.
Laugh yourself and do a running jump.
Just one thing.
Who was it that left the bunny?
You can tell him from me he's a mug.
So when are you going to tell her?
Wait and see. Come on, we're waiting!
She is hating every minute of this and it was her idea!
What's that phrase they use? Hoist by something or other?Petard.
Nothing like a bit of petard hoisting to get the party in a swing!
Oh, wow! You look absolutely beautiful, Mum.
Doesn't she, Syed?
Yeah, fantastic.
Yeah, can we get on with this, I'm feeling a bit self conscious.
I'm just setting the timer.
Syed and I were thinking that you and Dad should sit at the front
with Kamil, and we'll stand behind. Whatever you say.
Oh, Mum, I was going to mention, you know that book I was reading?
It's right up your street.
You might want to suggest it for your book group.Maybe.
Tamwar, how long you going to be?Almost there.
Just hold still. OK, no one move.
Something else I forgot to mention, I got a letter this morning.
Yes, I delivered it. Who was it from?My dad.
Oh, what did he want?
Oh, it was just a short note, but there was a surprise inside.
A cheque.Oh, wow! How much?
£5,000.Did you hear that, Zee? Wow...Why didn't you mention it?
We were waiting till we were all together, weren't we, Syed?
Lucky you, congratulations. OK, that's ten seconds from...now.
What are you going to do with the money?
Syed and I have discussed this and we thought it was best for us
to use the money to find a place of our own, set up home by ourselves.
£5,000 would not get you the deposit on a hole in the ground.
Not buying, Mum   renting. There's enough for a deposit and furniture.
OK, we're going to have to take that one again.
This time let's just all get in a line.
Mum and Dad in the middle, Syed and Amira on either side.
Hey, look what I dug out.
All right, so you didn't like the last college,
but I've been looking through this
and if you're talking electrician or mechanic,
then this is just the thing.
You get a qualification, on the job work experience...
Probably better than the Army's going to teach you. And no bullets.
Which is a bonus.
Could you just look at me? I'm trying to make an effort here.
What did I say earlier? Hmm? This is the moped all over again.
This is what you do.
Mum, it does my nut in.
All right, here's the deal...
get yourself a motorbike.What?
I'll even chip in what I can, anything you want  
the leathers, the lot.
I'll even find money for proper lessons. Just...
Just please don't do this thing.
So you got your phone on now?
It's... It's only Uncle Max. What's he want?Hello?
Billie? Get yourself down here, will you?
The Vic.
Well, you got a drink waiting for you.
Peggy's orders, nothing to do with me.
You all right, Dot? So what's this about then, Max?
It's her idea.
Will you stop mucking about? I mean it.
And look, you've got it upside down.
No. Now, come on. Come on, go on. Oh, that's it, lovely.
What did he want?
I dunno, something about a drink in the Vic waiting for me.Oh, yeah?
What's your problem now?
I know the way he works, I'm coming with you.Why?
I don't have to give you a reason. I don't want you there.
Well, tough! It's a free country. There's a reason for that  
there are people fighting to keep it that way.
Billie, come back here!
Billie!
Oh, here he is!
There you go, never let it be said
I'm not prepared to give a second chance.
Thanks, Miss Mitchell, and I'm really sorry.
Oh, don't worry about that, it's all water under the bridge, darlin'.
Oi, you! What do you think you're doing?
You're coming home, Billie. Don't be out of order.
Who asked you?Drink up, son. It's on the house.Son?
You're calling my boy "son"? He's not YOUR son, he's MY son.
Cos we all know about your son, don't we?
Carol, I really think... Yeah, well, don't think.
Let's talk about Grant, shall we, Peggy?
Yes, I'm more than happy to talk about my Grant.
Proud of him, are you? Yes, I'm very proud of him.
Made a man of him, did it?
That war turned him into a psycho.
I mean, you ask anyone who knew him back then.
We was scared in case he kicked off any minute.
War drove him nuts. Well, I'm not having that happen to him.
Come on, we're going home.No, Mum!
I ain't going anywhere. I beg your pardon?
You want to know the reason I'm joining? The real reason?
It ain't about seeing the world, learning a trade.
It's so I can get away from you!
