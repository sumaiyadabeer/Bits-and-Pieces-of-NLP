With a 3 metre wingspan, the condor is the biggest bird in the US,
but 20 years ago it nearly disappeared from California skies.
Today a pioneering project may just bring this magnificent bird back from the brink.
  Hello. I'm Ben Fogle.
  And I'm Kate Humble and this is the skeleton of a blue whale,
  the largest animal ever to have lived on Earth.
  It grows to the length of three double decker buses.
And we're going to be looking for the real thing. Here's what's coming up.
Can the rescue team save a sea lion washed up on a busy beach, confused and desperately ill?
What will happen when the scientists risk life and limb to put a tag on the world's largest creature?
And this orphan sea otter has found a new mum.
Now, for the youngster's own good, they must be torn apart.
But first, the coast of California can be a very crowded place.
Sometimes animals in distress get washed up on beaches packed with people.
Today lifeguards on San Francisco's busiest beach have spotted a sea lion in trouble.
He looks weak and is struggling to move.
He's been out of the water for over three hours,
but now a rescue unit has arrived from the Marine Mammal Center. They're the experts.
Every year they pick up 300 500 sick or injured sea lions.
Team leader Lauren DeMaio knows the coast pretty well.
We had a call about a sea lion at Ocean Beach
and it's a pretty busy beach, so it's pretty urgent to get out there as soon as we can.
So the sea lion must be caught and taken to a vet,
but he's probably frightened and confused and is likely to bite anyone who comes near.
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
Erin's gonna go out, she's gonna come from behind.
The animal is still really lethargic, but alert to our presence, so we'll sneak up from behind.
The boarders will come up behind her to protect her when she gets the animal in the net.
You never know what a sea lion is going to do when you rescue it.
Even the sickest sea lion, when it feels threatened,
will use every last ounce of energy to try to fight against you.
The main risk is me losing the sea lion into the ocean.
Or I could also get bit.
The big net is the safest way to restrain the sea lion.
It's specially designed not to harm the animal.
Can I get the carrier over?
Sea lions are incredibly strong. They can weigh up to 340 kilos   four times more than a grown man.
And a good portion of that is pure muscle.
Boards straight up and down.
The team must work quickly.
The more stress the sea lion gets, the more energy he'll use up,
which he can't afford to do when sick. But manoeuvring him is an awkward job.
Back up, you guys. Give him some room to turn. Everybody ready?
  Richard, watch your leg!
  I'm OK.
The net has a quick release mechanism, so it's easy to remove once the sea lion is in.
We will get the animal back to the centre as soon as possible and offload him to a pen.
The veterinary technicians will let us know what to do next.
Of all the sea lions that the centre rescues,
about half turn out to have a life threatening illness.
We'll be back later to find out what's wrong with this one and if he survives.
Now we're going to head inland because we have a rare opportunity
to meet a bird that disappeared from these skies just 20 years ago.
High above the sea in the hills above Big Sur is an extraordinary reintroduction program
with North America's biggest flying birds, the condors.
I'm here with Dr Mike Murray, who we tend to see at the aquarium,
  but these birds are your hobby.
  They certainly are. This is an amazing project in Big Sur.
And this is to reintroduce this bird back into North America after it was basically extinct in the wild.
  Very close to extinct, yes.
  A key to the project is Joe Burnett from the Ventana Wildlife Society.
You're a field biologist here, Joe.
What's happening today? Why have we got these birds in captivity?
Today we have eight birds that were trapped over the last week.
They're being pulled in due to a threat out in the wild from lead poisoning.
We grab the birds twice a year, basically before and after hunting season to detect lead levels,
and we also take the opportunity to bring Dr Murray up to look at the birds, change radio tags,
and GPS tags they might have on.
So today we have eight birds to process.
Presumably they are picking up carcases that have been shot that have lead shot in them?
  Is that how they get lead poisoning?
  Yes. We've actually been able to document
that the lead these birds are picking up is associated with lead ammunition.
The lead projectile goes through flesh, the birds eat those and they are exquisitely sensitive.
So what would happen to a bird that is affected by lead?
Lead acts as a neuro toxin, so it's going to affect the nerves,
the digestive system will stop, they may have seizures and, untreated,
lead poisoning will kill birds.
  But you can treat it?
  Yes. We have stolen treatments from human medicine
and use the exact same drugs that they might use in lead poisoning in children.
  That's why this is such an important process.
  Absolutely.
I gather you have a crew of people waiting in the wings. What is the way you minimalise the stress?
To be very, very quick.
The team going in is quite experienced. This is a very large, powerful bird. And dangerous.
  Very dangerous!
  So they have to be quick. But we've done this a number of times for a number of years.
They sort of know what they're doing, but unfortunately the birds also know what we're doing
and they consistently develop tricks to try to evade capture.
Now, Joe, these are scavengers,
so they wouldn't see your crew going in now as potential prey.
  They never go for live prey.
  Not unless they'd been laying dead!
  Well, let's hope that doesn't happen!
  Now you can see the birds know what's happening.
  OK, what you do see is that immense wingspan.
  Yeah.
  It's 10 feet.
  About three metres?
Yeah. And they can sail on those wings all day, for upwards of 150 miles in a day.
They're nature's perfect flying machine and it's pretty effortless.
It's been fantastic to see them.
Join us later when I will actually get my hands on a condor for the very first time.
They can grow over 30 metres long and reach up to 150 tons.
The heart of an adult is the size of a small car,
and the tongue weighs as much as an elephant. It's the largest creature to ever live on Earth.
This is the blue whale.
In the north eastern Pacific, their annual migration route takes them right past the coast of California
where, for the last five years, Dr Erin Olson has been working with the Cascadia Research organisation
to study this magnificent mammal.
The first several times I got really close to blue whales,
it was really amazing because here is this giant animal.
It's like being next to a wall, but the wall is moving
and its back is undulating and it just makes you feel very small
compared to this enormous animal.
The blue whale is also the loudest animal on Earth.
Their calls can reach 188 decibels   that's louder than a jet engine.
Erin is working on a pioneering project to find out more about how blue whales talk to each other
and, for the next phase of research, they've got some hi tech kit.
This is an acoustic recording tag.
What it records is the acoustics of what sounds the animal's making,
what sounds are in the environment that the whale can hear,
and also the dive depths.
But before it can record anything, it's got to be attached to a blue whale.
Professor Jim Harvey is an experienced scientist who knows how dangerous that is.
One of the ways animals will fend off other animals or potential predators, or in this case a boat,
is to flip to the side real fast. They could potentially hit the boat and knock us out of it.
Erin is going to be the one to attach the device.
The way we put it on the whale is with a big, long pole. We're careful not to injure the whale.
I stand at the front of the boat and we zoom up next to the whale,
kind of parallel, coming up from behind.
That's not a good hit. It's bounced off, but Erin's going to try again.
I guess it would be like you were trying to tag a 747 jet.
Bang on target! And it has stuck.
The whale won't notice it's there.
In the past, these acoustic tags have made extraordinary recordings  
the songs of the blue whale.
Although their voices are incredibly loud, they're also very deep.
It's so low, it's inaudible to the human ear. The only way to hear it is to play it speeded up
at least ten times.
So far what we've learned by using these tags is
that blue whales make three types of sounds. They make song...
..which is kind of like a humpback song, except very simple. Those are produced by males.
They're singing to the females.
Alternatively, there are other sounds produced by both males and females.
So maybe one animal produces a sound and then another some distance away produces another sound.
These are associated with feeding, so we think they are keeping groups together while busy feeding.
The team's research into how blue whales communicate is still at an early stage.
What they've learned so far just shows how much is yet to be discovered.
A few miles down the coast at Monterey Bay Aquarium, they've got some strange creatures on display.
I thought I was a thoroughly modern man until I found out about these guys   the seahorse.
They live in a world where the males give birth. It sounds like hard work to me. I'm off to feed them.
  Behind the scenes Jonelle Verdugo helps look after them. Morning.
  Morning, Ben.
  I've got some food here. Is it really true that it's the boys who give birth?
  It is, yeah.
The males get pregnant and they fertilise the eggs internally
and they close up their pouches where they keep them, a full pregnancy takes place,
  then they give birth.
  To how many youngsters?
  It depends.
This particular seahorse, the lined seahorse,
they usually can give birth to up to 300 babies at a time.
Unbelievable. And the girls just sit back and do what boys usually do and just enjoy themselves.
  Incredible. Now what food have we got here?
  We've got some krill, which is here,
  and then some mysis.
  They're both forms of shrimp?
They are. They're really into shrimp.
Just circle around so it spreads evenly and falls down.
  They'll see it and come up.
  Do they race up?
No. The hungrier ones might release whatever they're holding on to and go after the food,
but most will just stay holding on to this rock down here.
  Why are they doing that?
  Seahorses are not strong swimmers.
Really what they do is they have that tail to hold on to things.
They wait for prey to come by.
They're called ambush predators. They lie in wait.
Can you tell the difference between boys and girls by markings?
  The boys have a pouch.
  If you're looking at a seahorse, the female's belly turns very sharply into the tail.
And the males, the belly turns and gradually goes into the tail.
  That's where the pouch is.
  How do they move up and down? I see these little fins.
Is that how they propel themselves?
They're a fish, so like a typical fish they have pectoral fins
but they are up here by their ears.
We can just see some grabbing at the shrimp there.
They have a dorsal fin which is on their back that they use to push themselves along.
And are they eating the shrimps? It looks like they suck them in.
  They've almost got little tubes as mouths.
  Yeah, they have a snout.
What they do is suck in their food so with the krill and the mysis they usually suck the whole thing in.
  They almost have little horns. What are those?
  Those are cornets.
Each seahorse has a little one. Different species and individuals have a unique cornet.
  That's one way to identify them.
  Like their fingerprint?
  Kind of.
If males give birth, do they do all the chores as well? Do they catch all the food?
Once they go into labour, it can last several hours
when they're twitching, moving around, before pushing out the babies. Then they're done.
  And the mothers take over?
  The babies are all on their own.
  That's it?
  That's it.
But the male will go back to the female and get pregnant again, right away.
  It sounds like an exhausting life being a male seahorse.
  I think so.
I shall never complain when Kate makes me do the dishes again!
It's normally impossible to get a close look at North America's largest bird, the condor.
'So I jumped at the chance to join a team working to save the species.'
I am back in the hills above Big Sur
with an armful of condor.
Suddenly, when you have one of these birds in your arm, you realise just how big and how heavy
and how strong they are. Dr Mike Murray is here with me.
You're about to take a blood sample, Dr Mike, to find out whether this bird has lead poisoning or not?
  Is that right?
  Yes. We're looking to see what the blood lead levels are in this individual
and collecting blood that we can preserve and freeze for an extended time period
  should we have something we need to look at down the road.
All happening very easily. Just while we're looking at that foot,
it seems not to have the kind of classic predatory talons
  of other birds of prey.
  No, they really aren't talons.
These are carrion eaters. They eat dead things, they don't hunt at all.
So not classic talons for feet, but clearly a very powerful beak.
Yeah, razor sharp, designed to rip through rawhide leather.
This is an older bird. It's starting to get an ivory kind of look to it.
They spend a lot of their time keeping that razor sharp.
If he got a hold of one of us with that, we'd lose whatever he held.
  How do they keep it sharp? Just through use?
  Kind of like sharpening the blade on a knife.
They rub on rocks. Their neck muscles are very strong for tearing off flesh.
This is their weapon of choice. They can be aggressive with their feet.
They're not sharp talons, but they can do a number on you.
Is there anything they prefer to scavenge or are they unfussy?
They're pretty opportunistic. They'll take a free meal if they can get it.
Given that they're scavengers, so they're not killing anything,
why is it that their numbers suffered so badly and they got to the brink of extinction in the wild?
There was a thought that their food supply was running out, but it was at the hands of man.
The marine mammal food source was decimated along the west coast.
Sea otters almost died out, sea lions were down to very few,
elephant seals are like a canary in the coalmine, letting us know that we stepped over our boundaries
and the great news is that the marine mammal populations are coming up and we're managing them better.
The food sources are there. We're managing our issues   power lines, obstacles they face
that we present to them.
Joe is preparing wing tags. Why are these tags so important, Joe?
These are important for just everyday tracking of the birds and ID'ing the birds at a feed site.
This tag we can see from up to a mile away.
Here I'm attaching the radio tag which helps us radio track the birds when they go beyond the mile.
  It doesn't affect the flight at all?
  No. Ideally we'd not have them tagged, but it's a necessary part
  of the stage we're at.
  Sure.
  The goal is for these birds to have offspring that won't bear the tags
and won't be poked and prodded as much as these guys are.
They'll be worth it when you have a big number of condors back.
They're paving the way for the next thousand years.
OK, so here's the new tag going on.
The new tag is 165346.
There's a few more bits of data to collect for this bird. A new tag is to go on.
But we're really waiting for the lead results. If it's clear, this bird can be released.
Join me later for the results.
The distressed sea lion rescued from Ocean Beach has been taken to the Marine Mammal Center.
They've given him a name   Oy  
and discovered why he's so sick. He's been poisoned by a deadly toxin called domoic acid.
Oy was diagnosed by the Center's British born vet, Dr Frances Gunnand.
Domoic acid poisoning to an individual animal is usually fatal if it's at a high dose.
It causes seizures. So the animals have these really severe convulsions
and they look epileptic   flippers out, heads back.
And while that's happening, that's causing brain damage
because of the domoic acid and lack of oxygen to the brain during the seizures.
Domoic acid is a natural poison. It's a bio toxin produced by a particular kind of algae
that floats among the plankton.
Small fish eat it and sea lions eat the fish.
It's a problem that's appeared only in the last few years and has affected sea lions like a plague.
Now the killer algae is spreading and no one knows why.
1998 was the first year that we recognised domoic acid poisoning in sea lions
and in that year there were 400 sea lions affected.
Since then we've had blooms of domoic acid producing algae almost every year
and hundreds of sea lions washed up.
At this centre alone, they've taken in about 1,000 sea lions suffering from domoic acid poisoning.
Almost half of them died.
Oy is being treated with sedatives to try to control his fits,
but nothing can save him if he's already ingested too much toxin.
Deb Wickham is head of animal care and has worked here for 14 years,
so she's witnessed the rise of this dreadful poison.
For me, domoic acid is one of the hardest things
that I've dealt with. It's really frustrating.
The bio toxins, they keep happening, the algae blooms keep happening.
It seems to be getting worse and worse. We're seeing more of it.
So it's very frustrating and it's hard to see them go into a seizure.
It's vital to find out exactly how this new toxic threat is affecting the sea lion population.
Animals who have survived can play a key role in the research.
This is Pickle, a young female who has been nursed back to health
and is now being returned to the wild.
She's had a satellite tracking device glued to her fur.
It won't bother her and will just falloff when she next moults.
But until then the device will send back vital information about where she is
and what happens to her.
We don't know how many sea lions out in the wild drown at sea
or die or get poisoned and eaten by a shark while having seizures,
so we hope to be able to understand what some of the long term effects of exposure to domoic acid are.
Pickle has been lucky. Rescued by the centre, she has been given a second chance,
but Oy is still in intensive care. We'll find out if he survives later on.
California is blessed with a varied coastline.
As well as beaches and cliffs, there are estuaries and inlets.
I've met up with Professor Jim Harvey, an expert not just on blue whales, but also all marine mammals.
I'm out on a sea water inlet and it is absolutely hopping with wildlife.
Behind us is a huge group of otters, Jim. Is this something that they tend to do,
  come together in big groups?
  Yes. Especially in the middle of the day.
They'll rest a little bit more, stop foraging and rest together.
And will this be a family group? Will all of them be related?
No, most of the animals around here are relatively young.
There are some adults, but a lot of the animals here are juvenile males.
Usually the males will hold the territory during breeding season and try to keep females there,
mate with them, exclude other males and then, after the breeding season has broken down,
they are on their own.
The ones that look like they're playing, is this a sort of mock fighting? Actual fighting?
  Or just a bit of rough and tumble?
  It's sometimes hard to tell, sort of like humans!
But these guys will oftentimes test each other. There is some play,
but young males, especially, will wrestle with other males, trying to create some dominance.
  It's almost play fighting.
  And these males, when will they reach maturity?
  When will they be fighting for real for territory?
  Around the age of four to five years,
they start maturing enough to start battling.
It takes a certain amount of maturity as far as size, understanding how to fight, where to go,
before you raise to a six or seven year old which can start holding territory and mating.
There seems to be quite a lot of play going on, but also a lot of hanging out in a Californian way.
Yep, they definitely are Californian.
There's a lot of time where the animals will rest during the middle of the day
and do a lot of grooming also. Mornings and afternoons are more a time to forage.
Wouldn't it make sense to go on land where it's warmer than being in the water?
The water temperature is very cold.
Yep. These guys are different. Alaska sea otters do that.
They'll come up and get on land and rest on shore,
but California otters don't seem to do that. It's probably because there were a lot more predators here,
so they have evolved this system of staying in the water. We see them on land, but not often.
  Jim, it's a great treat to see them. Thank you.
  Welcome to California.
And we've got lots more coming up on today's programme.
Will Oy the sea lion live or die?
They've given him a 50/50 chance.
No, it's not Titanic   Part Two, it's Ben out dolphin spotting.
And now only must Tula be split from her foster pup, but she also needs a medical
and that's when things really turn tricky.
But first we're taking a journey to a strange and mysterious world.
In the abyss, over a kilometre beneath the surface of the Pacific,
lies a skeleton the size of a shipwreck.
This was once a blue whale.
No light ever penetrates this deep. The temperature is only just above freezing
and the water pressure is almost one ton per square inch.
It's not an easy place to visit.
But now, using a remotely operated vehicle, an ROV,
with high definition cameras, scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
are exploring this alien world.
They're in a unique position to study life in the abyss
because, right on their doorstep, is a massive underwater canyon.
It's a godsend to marine biologists like Shannon Johnson.
The deepest point closest to land in the ocean.
There's definitely deeper places, but nowhere else in the world can you travel half an hour off land
and be in 1,000 metres of water.
The whale died three years ago and ever since it landed on the ocean floor
the scientists have been revisiting its remains on a regular basis in order to see what happens.
Joe Jones is one of the team.
This is an unusual case of a whale that dies at sea. Suddenly you have a huge stock of food to come to.
It's just like a large Sunday dinner.
When there's free food, they all come to the table.
You never know what you'll find.
Some of the creatures which survive at this great depth are familiar, such as the shark and the octopus,
but most are like monsters from another world. The latest to be discovered was on the skeleton.
They've nicknamed it the zombie worm!
It may not look like much, but it is seriously weird.
We're looking at the actual trunk or main body of the female.
And within each of these females, she has males that stay in the transparent tube
and in certain species they can have up to 100 males per female, so it's very abundant.
The tiny males that live inside the females are very simple creatures,
little more than glorified sperm. The worms live here on the skeleton because that's what they eat.
In order to find out more, the ROV's robot arm is picking up a piece of bone to bring it to the surface.
It's like Christmas when the ROV comes up. We see all the stuff we think we've captured,
if it's alive, how it's doing and how many we got. And there's new stuff in there.
You never know what you really got when you pick it up, so it's kind of a surprise.
The bone, with zombie worms attached, is sealed in a cool box for transport back to the lab.
At the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Chad Widmer is a biologist specialising in jellyfish and invertebrates.
He's trying to keep the worms alive so that the scientists here can study them properly.
They know very little about the biology or ecology of the bone worms.
The only times they see them now is when they use the submarine
and they go out, spend the day, go down and look around for a few hours.
So if you have them in your lab, you can check in on them every day. "Oh, they look sick today."
You have a frame of reference instead of a visit once a month.
'What's really remarkable is their role breaking down these bones.
'I've had worms brought in on a very solid piece of bone.
'The bone was like a dinner plate.
'A couple of weeks ago, after the worms had been on it for three or four months,
'I grabbed this solid bone, picked it up and it crumbled in my hand. It creeped me out!'
So I think they are serving as a mechanical agent for breaking bones down.
They're not only working on whales. They'll work on seals, sea lions, any bone you find down there.
It's a crazy world.
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy...
Populated by zombies, aliens and monsters,
perhaps the only certainty in the crazy world of the deep ocean
is that there's still an awful lot yet to be discovered.
It's really exciting to work with all these new deep sea things that nobody's ever seen before.
This stuff just blows me away. That's why I do marine science, to see these new, amazing animals.
I love it. Keeps me busy.
'Earlier, up in the hills south of Monterey Bay,
'I helped do a medical check on a wild condor.
'We took a blood sample to test for lead poisoning, which plagues these birds
'because they eat carrion. Out here, hunting is still popular
'and the birds get the lead from carcases with used bullets.
'It takes just a few minutes to test the blood and now we've just had the results.'
Well, unfortunately, my beautiful condor has high lead in its blood,
but hopefully the next bird will be able to be released
and then we'll see the amazing sight of a condor taking off into the sky.
I'm on the coastal mountains of Big Sur with Kelly Sorenson from the Ventana Wildlife Society.
I believe they are on their way with a second condor. What's the process they're going through now?
A few people are with the bird.
We restrain condors using three people to maximise safety for bird and biologist.
They're carrying it out to this little point here
to gently let the bird touch the ground and then let it fly off.
  Will it take off straight away, as quickly as possible?
  Yes.
It might pause a second or so, but it should take off right away.
  It's a magnificent view up there. This looks like perfect condor country.
  It absolutely is.
Joe is a very happy man because this is a particularly clean bird.
Yeah, it tested very low, so we're excited to get it out there.
It was just released six months ago so it's got some new... It's making new friends out there.
  It's good to get her back out.
  Clearly adapting very well to a wild life,
  which must be very heartening for you.
  Yeah.
  ..Oh, wow!
  That's what it's all about.
  Beautiful, isn't it?
  Absolutely incredible.
  Joe, Kelly, thank you very much indeed for letting us be here today.
It's been a real treat. I hope the rest of the program continues to be as successful.
  Thank you.
  Here he is! Woo hoo!
Back at the Marine Mammal Center, it's been 10 days since Oy the sea lion was rescued
suffering from the effects of domoic acid poisoning.
He's made very good progress and hasn't had a seizure or fit for over a week.
But before he can be returned to the wild, they need to be sure he's eating well
and is strong enough to hunt for himself. He's in with another male sea lion for companionship
and Deb Wickham has been watching them closely.
Now the vet, Dr Frances Gunnand, has come to check on his progress.
  Well?
  He looks really good. He's eating well, he swims great. He looks really good.
He's awesome. Really fast, too!
Just looking at him here, he's swimming really well, competing with the other animal, aggressive.
He's only been here a very short time, so he should still be able to swim and forage for himself.
I think he'll do fine.
Almost half of the sea lions who come here with domoic acid poisoning don't make it,
so Oy is one of the lucky ones.
It's really rewarding. Domoic acid is so horrible.
You see them seizure and die and to see him go out so quickly I think is great.
And, three days later, Oy was fit enough to be taken to one of their usual release sites
and there returned to the wild open ocean.
The whole coast of California is very well endowed with wildlife,
but one of the richest places of all lies way out to sea.
'It's the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge,
'which is managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
'Normally, no one is allowed to land except research scientists and conservationists,
'so it's quite a treat to be here.'
I'm on the Farallon Islands with biologist Adam Brown
and this is an extraordinary wildlife reserve, 45km from the coast of San Francisco.
There seems to be just hundreds of mammal, bird species, the sea is hopping with life.
Why is this such a rich area?
There's definitely wildlife everywhere. It's protected and these places are much needed.
It's kind of their escape, their sanctuary from where we are back on the mainland.
And it is the place that has seen the return
of a mammal you thought was lost pretty much forever.
Yeah, in the middle 1800s, there was an animal, the northern fur seal,
that was the main marine mammal here.
And people came here and hunted them completely off the island.
Some estimates of 200,000 animals killed.
And they were taken for their fur, which was very warm and people used it for coats and hats.
  It was very sought after.
  You've taken some footage for us which I'm going to look at now.
There we go. We'll play now.
A colony, miraculously, has re established itself here.
Yeah. About 15 years ago, people started seeing the fur seal come back.
One here, one there. And then one year there was a pup. Then another single pup and another.
Them, five years ago, their population started doubling.
  Unbelievably, this year we had 100 pups on the island.
  That's extraordinary.
Why can't we go and see this colony for ourselves?
This colony is in the middle of 4,000 5,000 other breeding mammals on the island.
The disturbance when people go to these colonies is incredible.
And it can hurt their whole breeding cycle
so we try to keep as much distance away from them as possible.
Looking at this footage, their flippers look completely outsized for their bodies!
It's very funny. Those flippers are so they can move swiftly in the water,
but also so that when they come off onto land, they can use their flippers like fingers.
  They crawl around rocks and are really good climbers.
  Really?
  It's amazing how well they climb.
  Is it all year round
or is this a stopping off place on migration?
This is a colony that's primarily here during the summer and fall.
We do a single animal here and there in the rest of the year,
  but it's primarily a breeding area.
  It's such a fantastic story.
It must make you feel very heartened that by protecting an area
in a very short space of time a species can return and flourish?
You know, it's definitely success stories like this that make you feel good about what you're doing
and show you how powerful it is to protect areas that are important to species like the fur seal.
  This is a perfect example of it.
  This is fantastic footage.
Thank you so much for getting this for us. Thanks, Adam.
Earlier in the series, we met a baby sea otter who was abandoned, alone on the shore,
when she was just four weeks old.
She was the 353rd rescue case to be brought to the Sea Otter Research and Conservation Program
at Monterey Bay Aquarium, so they named her 353.
In the past, young orphans could never be returned to the wild
because there was no way to teach them survival skills,
but then it was discovered that some of the adult females here
had such strong mothering instincts that they would gladly take on the role of surrogate mum.
Carl Mayer and his team have been using this fostering strategy for three years now
  with some success.
  It's going well. Results have been encouraging.
Of the 10 animals we've released, six of them we know are still surviving,
which is a success rate roughly comparable to post weaning juveniles in the wild population.
Seven months ago, orphan 353 was paired up with Tula.
She's an experienced foster mum. This is the seventh youngster she's looked after.
Tula was rescued five years ago with an infection in the brain.
She still needs regular medication so can never go back to the wild.
Tula and 353 have got on incredibly well.
They really are like mother and daughter, but now the youngster is almost fully grown
and very soon she'll be ready to return to the ocean.
The time has come to break up this happy family.
Today's going to be the separation of pup 353 from surrogate Tula.
Usually the process is a little bit traumatic on both sides. There will be a lot of vocals.
Out in the wild, the mother would be the one who would initiate the weaning of the pup.
She would become receptive to a male and abruptly wean the pup.
Here it's basically the opposite. The separation is still abrupt for the pup,
but for the female, she may or may not be ready for this.
You'll be on the back side?
There's no kind way to do this, but experience has shown it's better to leave the baby in the pool
  and take the mother away.
  Ready?
Carl has caught Tula with the big net.
Two other youngsters have been put in the tank with 353 so she won't be left all alone.
Vocalising is a natural instinct when they're separated.
The mother will be more likely to be vocalising continuously after the separation.
She's searching for the pup. It's a mechanism they use in the wild to find each other.
Now they'll be watching 353 closely for the next few days
to assess whether she's ready to return to the wild.
Predicting success in release is really difficult. We can never tell until they are out there.
That's always going to be a question.
If we see abnormal behaviours developing, problems with her food consumption, things like that,
we may elect to postpone release, depending on how well she's doing, wanting a slight improvement.
The one thing we wouldn't do is put her back in with Tula.
She's going to have to adapt and develop in the absence of the mother.
Meanwhile, Tula is still upset and for her things are about to get even worse
because now she needs a thorough medical check up.
She may have picked up a disease or infection from 353.
The aquarium's vet, Dr Mike Murray, is back from the condor station
and to do the examination he has had to use anaesthetic.
But anaesthetising sea otters is a dangerous business
and Tula has just stopped breathing.
We'll find out later if she survives.
I'm out in a rather cold Monterey Bay on the Sea Wolf with marine biologist Nancy Black
and in front of us is an incredible sight. What dolphins do we have?
Lots of Pacific white sided dolphins. It's fun for them when they surf on the bow. They will leap out.
  I can't get over how fast they're going.
  They can completely keep up with the boat
and go faster if they wanted to.
  Any idea what speed they're doing?
  Probably about 15 knots.
  That is extraordinary. Are they social?
  You never see one alone. They're always in groups.
There's always three or four times as many below. They come in and take turns bow riding.
They live in these little sub groups of related animals and hundreds of sub groups form a big school.
One there has slightly less markings. Is it the same type?
There are a few northern right whale dolphins. They sometimes mix together with the whitesides
and form big multi species groups. But they have no dorsal fins. They look a lot different.
  What do dolphins eat out here?
  A whole variety of small fish.
Anchovies, sardines. And a whole variety of deep sea squid.
So mostly fish and squid.
  Just out there, they're breaching.
  They can do complete somersaults sometimes. Completely out, yeah.
Incredible. It looks like they're just jumping out of the water and collapsing!
Sometimes they do that repeatedly, like 20 times,
as communication or signalling. Sometimes it's just for fun.
  Do you know what they're communicating?
  It could be about changing directions,
it could be a dominance thing. It's hard to study, but it does seem to involve some communication
and a lot of really loud splashes. They could be shifting the group
  or calling their calves back.
  There goes another one!
  They're really jumping.
  It's great!
  What predates them out here?
  Killer whales are their only predator.
We have seen killer whales sneak up behind the school and toss a dolphin up in the air to catch them.
  You've seen that?
  Yeah. Amazing.
  That looks like almost a third type of dolphin, a speckly white.
  It looks like some Risso's dolphins.
Sometimes you get all three types in one area travelling together.
Risso's look a lot different. They have a really round head
and they're all scratched and marked up from the squid they eat, which have hooks on.
And they tooth rake mark each other.
They're fantastic. Nancy, thank you. You can leave us to our dolphin watching. Look at them go!
Back at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Tula the sea otter has just stopped breathing.
The vet, Dr Mike Murray, put her under anaesthetic for a medical check up,
  but she's reacted badly to the drug.
  She stopped breathing.
This isn't the first time that Dr Mike has had trouble with Tula and the anaesthetic drug fentanyl.
She's always been a little funky when it comes to the fentanyl.
And I believe that she's stopped breathing.
Moments later, to everyone's relief, Tula starts to breathe again.
The medical checks are essential to make sure that Tula hasn't picked up anything from 353,
the rescued wild orphan she was looking after.
We're always concerned when we bring an animal in from the wild that it may carry disease.
So we do quarantine those animals, they go through a quarantine process of approximately 30 days.
They're evaluated physically and through blood parameters so they don't pose a risk.
We can't give a 100% assurance, but we come as close as one can medically to make sure it doesn't happen.
It's an additional advantage to do what we do today before we put her with the other animals.
It's just one last check.
The examination over, Tula is given a drug to reverse the effect of the anaesthetic.
Normally this brings sea otters around within seconds,
but Tula's not moving.
Tula's going to make me old and grey before we're done working with her.
Three minutes later, Tula is still unconscious.
I just want to make sure she wakes up. She's breathing OK right now, taking nice, deep breaths,
but I don't feel better until they sit up and say hello again.
I think you're messing with me.
Yeah.
She's just laying there being leisurely.
The next day, Tula's blood tests have come back all clear,
so she can finally go back to rejoin the other adults.
They haven't seen each other for months as Tula was kept separate while she was fostering 353.
They all go through head jerking, which essentially is vigorously sniffing from scent recognition
of the new animal. Once they establish that this is a familiar individual, they settle right in.
It looks like Maggie has basically taken possession of Tula
and is not letting the others interact with her, so we'll see how that plays out.
These guys will have to deal with it a lot more in terms of making sure
that all the feedings are going smoothly, but it looks good.
Christine D'Angelo is one of the aquarists in charge of the otter exhibit.
She immediately vocalised when she saw the other animals and now she's playing with them.
Our animals really know each other because they're always together,
except if one is off to surrogate, so it's like a friend that you have not seen in a long time.
They're very happy, rolling around playing now.
So things are looking good for Tula, but what about her foster daughter, 353?
Job well done thus far.
The proof is in how this pup does once it's released back to the wild.
Every individual animal has definite significance and is important,
so it's a good feeling to get them back out into the wild.
And later in the series we'll find out what happens
when the time finally comes for 353 to return to the wild.
It's almost the end of the programme, but Ben and I have come out here to this sea water inlet
absolutely teeming with wildlife.
We're here with Professor of Marine Science Jim Harvey
and we're inching our way very slowly to have a look at this fantastic group of harbour seals.
We have harbour seals in Britain. Are these the same species?
Yes, exactly the same species. Harbour seals are pretty well ranging throughout the North Pacific
  and North Atlantic.
  Are they just sleeping, resting?
Yeah, at this point during the daytime, quite a few animals come and rest onshore.
At night time they'll go off to sea and feed, mostly on flat fishes, octopus, that sort of thing.
They're all just eyeing us, saying, "Don't come any closer."
so they get used to boat traffic.
Since we're the only boat out here right now, they're being cautious.
This is a spot where we've captured seals, so some may remember us.
  Captured them for research and for education?
  Right.
  They're much quieter than sea lions.
  That's one reason I like them!
I equate them with being the cats of the ocean. Sea lions are dogs.
Well, Jim, thank you very much. Sadly, that is it, but here's what is coming up on the next programme.
A natural born killer is in grave danger.
He must eat or die.
Down on the beach, the chicks are gorgeous, but these little birds are in big trouble.
And the two rescued orphans, Mingo and Lulubelle, are very weak.
We'll find out if they both survive.
So don't miss the next Wild On The West Coast.
