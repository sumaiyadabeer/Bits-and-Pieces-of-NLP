University Challenge.
Asking the questions, Jeremy Paxman.
Hello and welcome to the first match of the 2011 to 2012 University Challenge Championship.
The team who win won't necessarily be the most intelligent people in Britain,
but they will know a lot, lot more than most of us, irritating.
But it won't be enough for them to tell us the simple things like the square root of minus 1
or whether Picasso's blue period came before or after his rose one.
They will also have to demonstrate the occasional passing acquaintance with real life,
like what a washing machine looks like. The University of Warwick came into being in 1965.
It's a campus university notably located much nearer to Coventry than Warwick
and is known for its close relationship with the business community
which earned it the warm embrace of New Labour in the 1990s.
Alumni include the singer Sting and the comedy writer Stephen Merchant
and Germaine Greer is Professor Emeritus of English.
This is Warwick's 13th appearance since this series relaunched in 1994
and they were series champions in 2007.

let's meet the Warwick team.

It got its royal charter from James VI in 1582.
Since then, alumni have included the philosopher David Hume,
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Gordon Brown and the former CEO of BP Tony Hayward.
