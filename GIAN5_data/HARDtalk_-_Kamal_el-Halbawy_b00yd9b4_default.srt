priorities. Now it is time for Hardtalk.
In the current turmoil in Egypt, one of the oldest and biggest
opposition parties, the Muslim Brotherhood, have kept a low
profile. Prohibited in the past, they are now keen to play a bigger
political role in the post Hosni Mubarak Egypt. My guest today on
Hardtalk is come I'll tell how Bali from the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood.    Kamal el Helbawy. Kamal el Helbawy, welcome to
Hardtalk. Other Muslim Brotherhood helping to organise these protests
in Egypt? We have participated with a low profile. We did not start it.
Are you going to start taking a more active role, as you say you
have been participating and individuals. When you start
well disciplined and organised parties or groups or movement in
Egypt to play a role and the trend for that is the Muslim Brotherhood.
Are you going to rise for the occasion now? You are banned in
Egypt, are too? Does the band still hold? There is no official word. It
is all in the air. As far as the Muslim Brotherhood leadership is
concerned, do they consider that the official ban on them is still
in effect? It still exists in some way. It has to be lifted. How might
that happen? Now President Mubarak, with his new vice president, Omar
Suleiman, and the new government say that they want to have a
dialogue with all of the opposition parties in Egypt. Would the Muslim
Brotherhood engage in a dialogue? They will if it is in the interest
of the country. If it is within the core ordination process. The
members team that has been formed will accept it. They are talking
about the National Unit for change? No, the newly formed Association of
different parties. Not only the National Association for change.
is an umbrella group, basically. Putting together all the opposition
what this umbrella group has made? Of course they will be happy. I
consider the leader to be a philosopher. He has raised the
requirements of the people from just reform to change. So let's get
this straight   the Muslim Brotherhood, with its as La make
roots, has said to Mahomed El reedy, that they will rally behind him   
Mohamad ElBaradei e? Yes, the Muslim Brotherhood is not in
position to come to power directly. We should work with the people for
the interests of the people. We cannot defy secularism. The Muslim
Brotherhood believe very strongly in freedom. It may be the only
institution in Egypt that practice freedom and democracy inside.
Inside itself. You can't really say that   it has not been put to the
test apart from 2005 when there was an election and to won 88 seats.
Inside itself   and they followed the fall democratic rules that can
bring them together and listen to their opinions inside themselves.
Not on the national level. Are you really committed to democracy as an
organisation? 100%. Even before democracy was created. You know
there are many critics who say that that is what you are saying now  
but if you gained power, it would be a different matter. For example,
a former American official in the State Department says that it would
be delusory to take the Muslim Brotherhood democratic
protestations at face value. If they do take control, it is going
to be impossible to take it back. Many sayings are here and there.
The people in the world and the superpowers misunderstood the
Muslim Brotherhood. Where they stand regarding the peace process
and America and Germany in their peace efforts. He is just one of
many critics. They say that the Muslim Brotherhood says, OK, we
believe in democracy   but it will be one person, one vote and only
once. Then you get into power, and that's it. When Robert like an met
me in 2007 and stayed with me to study the Muslim Brotherhood and he
wrote his article in March   April 2007, he had the same idea. He
changed it completely when he met members and saw their practices in
Egypt. You are not in power. The point that people are making is
that if you were to seize power, those democratic credentials would
disappear. This is the belief about Muslims, not only Islamists. To
believe in whatever they want to believe. It is the freedom that God
gave to the people to oblige anyone to believe in your own belief. Let
me explain this very clearly   God created people and he obliged them
to believe in what he wanted them to do. How could anyone do that?
the aim of the Muslim Brotherhood to establish a state in Egypt that
is governed by Sharia law? Islamic law? If the majority of the people
and the democratic act allow it? You think that is a better way of
living? I do. I am astonished that the West, who important
Christianity from the east, are against Islam that comes from the
east. What would and Egypt, governed by the Muslim Brotherhood,
be like? Freedom from temptation, equality. Freedom of belief,
freedom of expression. Everything in freedom. Would a woman be
expected to dress in a modest, Islamic way? Where a veil? I said
earlier, many times on television and in newspapers   if Margaret
Thatcher ruled over Egypt, I would support her 100 times more than
someone like Hosni Mubarak. would have to wear a veil? So a
woman could be Prime Minister in a Muslim brother would Egypt? If the
people accept her, yes. If the majority acceptor, I am with her.
Would you change the constitution to support Sharia law? I would
never change the constitution unless the real parliament is able
to do that and it is in the interest of the people. If you won
an election and had a majority in the General Assembly, would you
seek to change the constitution to make it in line with shabby a law?
there should be a balance. Would you allow alcohol to be served in
Egypt, if you were in power? would not believe, that Islam
allows factories of alcohols for non Muslims in the country that is
ruled by Islam? So you would allow alcohol to be served to non Muslims
in Egypt? Not only that, but to have their own factories.
Egyptians could not drink alcohol. They are Muslims, they should abide
by Islam. So they would not be allowed to? I proposed earlier that
if Muslims, Jews, Christians come to the temple monuments by Moses,  
  Ten Commandments. Do not kill, do not commit adultery   do not be
envious of your neighbour   these are the 10 Commandments. The reason
I bring up alcohol is because Egypt relies on tourism as a foreign
currency earner. $11 billion a year as you're GDP, that is 11%.
Islam, it should not be a source of income. But tourism in Egypt   a
lot of people go to Egypt, 12 million people a year. Such an
important money earner for your state profit. If they think there
are restrictions on alcohol in Egypt, they might not want to go on
holiday. There are hundreds of sources of income generating.
are you going to get $11 billion from? You can make $11 billion a
year to make up for the loss of that? If we support armies like
India and Czechoslovakia, you can make millions. This does not mean
that I am against drinking alcohol for non Muslims in the country.
may put them off and have a detrimental impact on tourism, you
accept that? Not at all. People would not want to go to a place,
asking for their passports before they have a drink. Let them ask
Rory drink, they can have a drink. You just said that you should not
make money by selling alcohol and that is a vital part of the
industry. In the Islam, it should not be a source of generating
income. There are many other sources that you can depend upon.
You can develop industries, trade, exports. That will take a while.
People are marching on the streets now because you have 800,000
Egyptians coming into the job market every year. They have no
work. You are saying, we are going to lose the tourism industry, a bit,
it employs all of those Egyptians. You will make life worse for them.
Islam is not the main problem that produced this unemployment and the
people living in graveyards. I am projecting to and Egypt that is run
by the Muslim Brotherhood. This loss in earnings, because of the
impact of tourism, which is so vital to Egypt, could be
detrimental. You have to accept that? I would like to confirm that
the Muslim Brotherhood are not thinking of establishing an Islamic
state unless the majority, crushing majority of the people, are behind
it. Otherwise it would be another What is your view about the West?
enjoyed the freedom in the UK. Ghannouchi from Tunis was here on
Saturday, and I enjoyed it. But as the former leader of Tunis. What do
you say to someone like the American Muslim who come   
campaigned against political Islam. He says there is little difference
between groups like Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood. He says
even non violent political Islam but teachers supremacy, but
teachers Western society is cobblers and corrupt, is the
slippery slope towards radicalism. That is a fellow Muslim saying that.
But he is not an Islamist. He is against political Islam. Yes. I
would like to say that there is a difference between a Muslim and the
Islamists. Islamists would never say that. But this is a Muslim only.
He does not understand Islamism probably. He is against political
Islam precisely before    because it creates divisions. It makes
people think they are different from the West. Then he is against
the majority of accepted Islam, and I am not. But that is why you get
people like the British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, saying
that it is not for a Western government to decide who would run
Egypt, but I would be opposed to a government in Egypt that was based
on the Muslim Brotherhood. Why he should be... As I said earlier, the
West imported Christianity from Palestine. Why is he opposing other
religions? They have suspicions about you. Egypt has been a bastion
of stability in the Middle East. It had peace with Israel 30 years ago.
People worry that that will unravel now. It is not realities and facts.
Let them try and co operate. Let's take the peace treaty, then.
Binyamin Netanyahu has said he is buried concerned that a radical
regime would mean that the peace between Israel and Egypt will not
survive. Will it? This is not the time to discuss such a matter, but
other like to confirm to you and to the West in general that if any
peace process build on justice, the mob    was on brotherhood will
support it 100%. But if there is any peace process build on
injustice, then we have to bring justice before the peace process.
When a respected commentator says that if the Muslim Brotherhood in
Egypt were to be in control, they would tear up the peace treaty
between Egypt and Israel, he is wrong? Completely wrong. He is
dreaming sometimes while he is drinking his coffee. LAUGHS. He is
dreaming and he has said many nonsenses in many years. He has
said good things. You reassure Binyamin Netanyahu that he would
not tear up the peace treaty? tear it. But we would discuss, as
we said. We need justice and freedom. Not only for us, but for
every one. There are many Jews, and I have very high relationship for a
while a rabbi, but he is Andy    he is Eddie Israeli atrocities.
Because Hammas was created from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. You
have supported them and you obviously know that Hammas, seen as
a terrorist organisation. It is not a terrorist organisation. You say
that, but the Israelis and Americans don't like it. If someone
entered your house and dismissed you and you want to get your house
again, argue a terraced? If you defend yourself? But when you speak
like that, that is what concerns people like William Hague. They
worry that perhaps Egypt, under the control of the Muslim Brotherhood,
or one where the was the brother would play it a bigger part, will
perhaps change the dynamics and brink instability. William Hague
and others must be happy to establish justice before they
defend Israelis. They should defend justice weather with Israelis or
against Israel. This is the main purpose of human rights. William
Hague should be committed to freedom, to human rights, and he
can't see millions of Palestinians outside and the destruction of
homes, and he should not say any rights were. We should advise
Binyamin Netanyahu. We should not find another Hitler in the area.
The West has created the problem. It is not the Muslims or the Muslim
Brotherhood who created the problem of Israel. Looking at the protests
that are going on now, how much support do you think the Muslim
Brotherhood have? We are always told that you have strong roots and
organisations and support. If there was democracy in Egypt, do you
think you would be the biggest party? I do believe that. I believe
that we would be one of the biggest parties. If there is real democracy.
As I said before, we must respect the will of the people. If we are
the majority, or if we are a minority. Will that not scare
people? You look at people like political analysts in Cairo, one
often said that for so long Mubarak stayed in power because the
alternative was the Muslim Brotherhood. If you beat your head
now, people will say that they don't know what they are going to
be unleashing into the vacuum. believes that if the Muslim
Brotherhood came to power they would become a superpower and
control the United Nations and control the military and cancel
everything. And they are wrong. It is not a material picture at all.
You have seen the people now, in the streets. None of the leaders of
the Muslim Brotherhood started it. Exactly. It is the most secular,
liberal... Women without headscarves and so on. This is the
exploiting what is going on now? wanted to do change a long time ago,
even before most of the people protesting in the streets were born.
Most of this generation were born in the time of Mubarak. They are
secular, liberal for the most part. Many of them. Are you not been
in that? They are very wise. They have good political awareness. They
behave nicely. The Muslim Brotherhood help it and organise it,
the public committees and safety committees. But that's all. They
did not lead. They are a part of the leaders. He played a long game
in Egypt in 1992, for instance, the Cairo earthquake, you were quicker
than the authorities on the scene. Is this a Welfare Project? You are
running welfare projects for many impoverished people in Egypt. Are
help? No. If you are helping the people, treating them... To get
their support? By in their support? No, we are not buying their support.
America has bought most of the rulers in the Middle East. Egypt
receives $1.3 billion from America every year. I will say it to
America, thank you, because I am reduced from my land and my people,
billions. If America needs, I will give him. You need a charismatic
leader. Is your leader charismatic enough to be fielded as a
presidential candidate? We are still very far from the Muslim
Brotherhood coming to power. But if the people... There is a
presidential election in September. Who would be your candidate? If the
people accept him and accept the Muslim Brotherhood and a select him
