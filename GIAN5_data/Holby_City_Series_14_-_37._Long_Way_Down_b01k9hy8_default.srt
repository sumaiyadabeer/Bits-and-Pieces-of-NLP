  About last night...
  Don't worry about it.
I know where your head's at, Luc.
So we sleep together, then we have to go on the obligatory date.
Before you know it, we're having domestics in the canteen.
We can just take it one step at a time.
Is Daniel Hamilton working here today?
You're his dad?
Yes, for my sins. Where do you think he gets his good looks from?
He doesn't have a clue about you, does he?
I've got your old man's X ray results.
I don't think we'll be calling a cab anytime soon.
What?
I was just thinking I'm...
What?
I'm really...uncomfortable.
Yes, so am I really uncomfortable.
This was a terrible idea.
Terrible.
Whoo, serious bit of kit.
My father wants to leave here looking his best.
Yeah?
Always fancied myself with one of these.
I used to watch him shaving when I was little.
The mark of a man.
He'd put a blob of foam on my cheek, pretend to shave it off.
Cheers.
Are you expecting anybody?
I thought it was time you met my folks.
Sorry, did I wake you up?
What do you want?
Erm... Mr Hanssen said to remind you that you've got a meeting
with him this morning.
Right. Thank you.
What does Hanssen want?
No idea.
She's such a nosey cow.
Have you told your dad?
Tell him what?
He's got motor neurone.
Yeah...last night.
And?
Took it on the chin. "We've all got to die of something."
And what about you?
If my father can refrain from emotional incontinence,
I think I can too.
Someone I'd like you to meet.
What did you say?
Someone I'd like you to meet.
It's my stress ball. He's called Willoughby.
I'm feeling slightly nauseous.
It's really good at building muscle strength.
You can do it any time   watching TV, sitting on the loo.
Here. Have a go.
It's just, you know, to get you started, for your condition.
I don't have a condition, I have a disease that's going
to machete through me till I'm a twitching,
incontinent rabble of bones, unable to eat, sleep or breathe.
Death's going to seem like an upgrade.
What's Willoughby's response to that?
There are ways to slow down the progress.
I'm going to hell in a handcart. I don't want the scenic route.
Ah   look at that. Top fly half.
Never missed a catch, never shirked a challenge.
  How are you feeling?
  Bit sore.
  I see you've started with the physio.
  Physio...
This is going to be my life from now on, being patronised by some...
Thank you, Chantelle.
So? Could you tell me? Conquest?
  Dad!
  Consultant's prerogative, time was.
Times have changed.
We don't... We don't brag about it so much.
You owe me sushi.
Me Sacha, not Sushi.
I saw her in the campervan.
You sure?
Yup, she was trying to hide.
So you're not sure.
Who else would be trying to hide?
Anyway, I saw her hair. It's date night tonight. My choice.
  And it's sushi.
  Sushi...
It's just... It's going to be all over the ward.
There's a price you pay for a work place fling.
It's not a fling, don't call yourself a fling...
I just don't want other people labelling us.
I'm not a number, I'm a free man.
You watched The Prisoner?
From the ages of nine to eleven I was a teenage boy.
Let's sneak in separately.
Go on, let's deny everything
and pretend we don't even like each other.
  I don't know...
  Please?
Other way.
Well, first of all, I would like to welcome back Ms Naylor.
I hope that the research trip was fruitful and I also hope that
some of that famous California laid back attitude has rubbed off.
Does anyone else have something more important they could be doing?
Right.
Skip suntan jokes.
I hope that you've all managed to read Mo's report on the sudden death
of our heart/lung patient, Warwick Randall.
So far, postmortem biopsies have failed to reveal any rational
explanation for the death.
For the benefit of Ms Naylor,
might I remind you that the purpose of these meetings is to
analyse our actions in order to discover whether a negative
outcome could have been avoided in order to obviate a recurrence.
It says here "cardiac arrest". Doesn't that cover it?
Well, it's what happened. We don't know why it happened.
The patient was given theraproxamine.
Maybe he had a reaction?
The patient was accepted for surgery because he ticked all the boxes.
Plus theraproxamine has never been linked with rejection,
otherwise I would have said so in my report.
What's wrong with this picture?
Surprise me.
Two agency nurses doing one job.
Fewer nurses equals better care. Impeccable logic.
"War is peace."
That's so quaint. You're quoting Orwell. Like he's still relevant.
Come on, you know our target spend isn't being met.
What do you suggest we cut?
Right, well, will you tell Chantelle this is
  her last day or will I?
  Why Chantelle?
She's been here longer than Simon.
Simon's more efficient.
You want rapid throughput. Take a look at that smile.
What could be better at accelerating the patient recovery?
Yeah. You show me the figures for that, I'll stop laughing.
What do you think?
About what?
You want me to go along with the pretence you weren't listening?
Simon or Chantelle?
We need them both.
Part of my remit is to make the figures work.
I know. We'll take a decision based on today's performance.
Hey, how do you fancy a little bet on the side,
make it more interesting?
Do you know how hard it is for agency nurses to find work today?
You're about to make somebody redundant and you're trivialising it?
Ric, it was a joke.
Spinal trauma, open fracture of the femur, head injuries.
He was found unconscious in the middle of a field   no footprints,
no tyre tracks, nothing.
Time slip. Crashed through from another dimension.
Tachycardic. B/P 100 over 50. Pulse is 110.
Oxygenation 98%.
Right. Two identities. Think he leads a double life?
On my count. One, two, three.
And again. Formal roll.
I'll support the head. One, two, three.
And back.
I need a repeat set of bloods.
Let me have a look at the neck, chest, and pelvis X rays.
Get a thoraco lumbar spine and AP and lateral femur.
Get a berth in theatre ready for immediate use.
No, found in a field, in the middle of nowhere.
Illegal immigrant. They hide in the wheelbase of planes.
Hard to hold on when the landing gear's engaged.
  Could be.
  I could do the ASIA.
Why are you smiling? The man needs immediate assessment.
Somebody's on it.
Yes, by the time they've cleaned the wound, it could be all over,
  poor beggar's lost his leg.
  Dad, you're recovering from an operation.
That's not it, is it, though?
  That's not why you won't let me help.
  Dad...
I may have motor neurone but I'm as sharp as I've ever been.
Don't bury me before I'm dead.
Mr Hanssen?
Yes?
Would it be breaking protocol if I looked into this?
You have your CT rotation to prioritise.
  I'll make time.
  I don't want you consumed by it.
But you can show me anything you've found by the end of the day, please.
Chantelle.
I need you on top form today.
Of course.
Mr Hamilton, if you could just unbutton your PJs.
I just need to check your wound.
  I've done it, it's fine.
  Sorry?
I've checked the wound,
it's fine, last thing it needs is somebody poking at it.
Mr Hamilton, if I can't do my job, you can't go home.
We had a nurse like you at Barts. Couldn't take a temperature.
She made up for it in other departments.
He's being a bit rude.
Listen, don't take it personally. I don't think he means it.
You think I don't know my own mind?
I'm sorry, Mr Hamilton,
but we just need to be aware how MND might affect mood.
Are you implying I have dementia as well?
  No...
  Very fashionable to link MND and dementia.
If I had a neurodegenerative condition my son would have told me.
Yes, I'm sure he would.
Doctor Lo.
Bed eight, prepare her for theatre. In your own time, of course.
So I'm at Camp Bastion Field Hospital,
and they're picking bits of plastic out my head,
this little Afghani nurse comes over and takes my pulse, tells me,
perfect English mind you, tells me I've got a heart defect.
Army Medical not pick that up?
They claimed I mustn't have had it when they signed me up.
Second degree heart block.
And she can tell just by holding my wrist.
Something's been lost along the way, I'm telling you.
You want to know what really happened?
Don't do that.
This didn't come from me. After they closed him up again...
..Hanssen couldn't find his gherkin sandwich...
Goes all the way to the top, this.
Oliver, can I ask a huge favour? I've got all this to get through.
You couldn't prep bed eight, could you?
You'd be really helping me out.
Thank you.
  Busy.
  Always.
Busy trying to impress Hanssen.
If only she made half that effort for you.
Thoracic fracture.
  Straight to theatre.
  Still waiting on the CT scan.
By the time you get it I could have repaired the femur.
The fracture's an emergency.
If we don't act now, it could be game over.
OK, do it.
I need you with...vascular issues.
Not impossible.
Can we help you?
I can see you're busy. I'll come back later.
Do we know how it happened?
Not yet, no. The police are looking into it.
I won't hold my breath then.
And could you get Simon to re dress the head injury?
Sure.
Was that for my benefit?
What?
Simon's on a break. Why didn't you ask Chantelle?
How're you feeling?
Been better.
  Oh?
  Never explain, never complain, eh?
Sorry?
I don't want to fuss, given that Daniel works in the hospital.
  What's happened?
  I've been verbally abused by one of your nurses.
Which one?
Brown hair. Male. A bit light on his loafers.
What did he actually say?
Well, she must have something special.
What?
Eddi...
Got you roped and tied, mate.
You know, not like that.
  Like what?
  You know, like...
lassoing a wild mustang, you know, that type of thing.
Anyway...you two, I hope it's... I hope it's cool.
Do you think somebody might be winding you up somewhere?
Sorry, have I got this completely wrong?
Right. Sushi's off. My choice   burger and chips.
There's been a complaint.
Oh, let me guess.
He said you were patronising, insulting...
Your father's made a complaint against me.
What did you do?
What did I do? What else did he say?
No, no, no. It's all going to come out anyway.
You told him his ability to think like a rational human being
was impaired.
He was being rude to Chantelle, I suggested that we
take his illness into consideration.
  You said he had dementia.
  No, I did not say that.
Look, I think he has some kind of a problem with me.
We should have this conversation later.
What? He says my father's lying and I've just got to accept it?
  You weren't there.
  OK. That's enough.
  This is ridiculous.
  I said, that's enough. There's a patient in there.
Do the job you're paid to do.
Tara, I haven't had a chance...
Sorry, not right now.
Dr Lo!
Bed eight. Lainey Craig.
I told you to prep her half an hour ago.
Yeah, she did ask me but I was called away.
When I tell you to do something you don't farm it out, you do it.
You read my report?
Of course.
So where did I go wrong?
  You think it's my judgement?
  No.
  My thoroughness?
  No.
  You're just not smart enough.
  Maybe that's it.
  Innate stupidity.
  Which is why Dr Lo...
  Not being a complete numpty...
..will find out whatever I...
  ..in your doltish way.
  Yeah, all right, Jonny.
  Sorry.
  Which is why Dr Lo will find whatever I failed to uncover.
Who knows? Maybe there is something to learn.
But right here, right now, that's not our job.
So maybe you need to go back to Mr Hanssen, tell him you've got more
important things to do   like not scoring zero in your CT rotation.
  What have we got?
  His wife found him struggling to breathe.
  Toxic shock?
  Couldn't get much out of her.
  Where is she?
  En route.
She refused to come in the ambulance.
Needle marks here. Can you hear me?
She said he couldn't move his eyelids.
  Couldn't move his eyelids?
  What she said.
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
I'm Mr Hemingway.
Going to do everything we can to get your eyes working again.
OK, get him in, quick as possible.
A full set of bloods, clotting, group and save.
Glucose, chest X ray, get a urine sample
and broad tox screen as a matter of urgency.
You think he can hear you?
Oh, yeah. He's fully conscious. He's just trapped.
What do you mean "trapped"?
Miles inside his own body. He must have had a major stroke.
Hi, Lainey, I'm Doctor Lo, I just want to run through a few things
before your operation...
I'm having a pacemaker fitted.
Yes. So you'll be having a local...
General. I've opted for a general anaesthetic.
It's a fairly simple procedure.
I've got this stupid nervous thing going on, it's pathetic.
  Not me at all.
  It says in your notes you're ex Army.
Caught a bit of shrapnel at Helmand. Listen to yourself...
  "Caught a bit of shrapnel..."
  What happened?
What happened? My mate Marco... big, tall gormless lad...
uniform hanging on him, y'know, he went and stood on an IED.
  Improvised explosive device.
They case them in plastic to avoid detection.
I got splinters from the casing.
  Was your friend killed?
  No...
They design 'em to injure. Stretch your resources.
He lost an arm, both legs...
OK, we're running a bit late to theatre so just lie back
and I'll take you in myself.
You were in the Army with a second degree heart block?
I didn't know when I joined. Probably should've.
Used to get these dizzy spells.
Just made me more determined to do well.
Easy.
You might want to loosen that screw.
I thought you were in a hurry.
The spinal fracture should've taken priority.
Over an open femoral fracture? What, are you trained as a vet?
  Need a hammer?
  Mr Malick, do you mind?
It's all right. Won't be long.
Tricky when your mind's elsewhere.
My father doesn't lie.
Sure. Like father, like son.
  What is your problem?
  I don't have one.
  So why...?
  Serena's talking about getting rid of an agency nurse.
You've just made her decision a bit easier.
Make good and close.
One of the screws still needs tightening.
  There's no pulse.
Femoral artery damage. On table angiogram.
  Come in.
I'm sorry, this is all I have.
Leave it there, please.
  My CT rotation...
  I'm not given to unrealistic expectations.
I looked into theraproxamine...
I'll read it in due course.
Dan. Dan!
Do you really think if you ignore your problems
they'll just disappear?
My dad'll be gone in...
in a few hours.
  Let's just get through it without any more incidents.
  Incidents?
  Woah! You need to lie flat.
You're in hospital. You've had an operation to repair your leg.
You need to minimise movement.
We haven't been able to contact anyone to let them know.
You had two wallets on you when you came in.
Are you Ben or Alex?
No. Alex is my mate. You need to get onto the police.
How did you get your injuries?
I mean, you need to get onto the police now!
They want to know what happened.
Alex is in a balloon. It's his first time.
He hasn't got a clue how to fly it.
Look, you need to call the police, please.
What's this got to do with your injuries.
Alex dropped his wallet. I climbed out to try and get it.
The thing just drifted off.
I grabbed hold of the rope but it just took me up.
I tried to climb back up but I couldn't...
I had to let go.
Right.
Just call the police, please!
Results?
Not yet.
B/P's 90 over 50. As soon as his wife gets here...
I know.
Hypotension. If you don't know what's causing it...
  You can't treat it.
  Exactly.
I've made you a coffee.
Luc, just because I know how you take your coffee
doesn't mean we're conjoined.
Anyway, nobody's watching, you can drop the act for a bit.
  Eddi, I prefer to stay in character.
  You don't get it, do you?
You know when you play hide and seek as a kid?
I didn't, really, never saw the point.
Well, the best part of it is when you get found.
Oh, my God.
Are you his wife?
Yes. I'm Zoey.
  Where have you been?
  I went back to lock up. The ambulance had gone.
How long's he had Locked in Syndrome?
He suffered a stroke two years ago.
Moving his eyelids, that's his only form of communication?
Yes, until this morning.
  Are you his sole carer?
  Yes, medically qualified.
  Does he have any allergies?
  No.
Could you explain the needle marks, please?
  He's diabetic.
  Has he had any today?
  No. I found him first thing.
  The patient needs insulin.
I need you to tell me everything you've given him in the past 48 hours.
I feed him through a peg tube. I'm meticulous.
That's his meds.
  Excellent.
  And that's the food.
Thank you. Is this everything?
  Yes.
  You're absolutely sure?
Of course I'm sure, I've been doing it for two years.
Every day, the same thing.
Could he have come into contact with any organo phosphates?
  No.
  You make this yourself?
I use formula. He prefers it.
  Does the formula contain fish?
  No.
  Could he have suffered a fall?
  I've hidden his BMX!
He could have fallen out of bed. I'm trying to...
If we can't treat him he's going to die.
If I knew what was causing it I'd tell you.
You said you're medically trained.
  Pharmacist. Six years.
  A pharmacist?
Does that qualify you to look after a patient
with Locked in Syndrome?
He's not a patient, he's my husband.
Mr Griffin.
When we spoke about Simon, I didn't realise his job was under threat.
You're backing your father, though, he was telling the truth?
Yes, of course it was the truth, but he's been through a lot.
It's not impossible he took Simon's words the wrong way.
Because he's homophobic?
Homophobic?
Some of his views, I don't know, they might be a bit old fashioned.
  Old fashioned?
  He hates...
He hates weakness   weakness in men...
I don't want Simon to lose his job over anything I've said.
Nevertheless, Simon may have... misjudged the situation.
  How'd it go?
  Great.
She had a wee panic in the transfer, took a header onto the floor.
  What?
  Somebody forgot to put the rail guard up.
  Was that me?
  When she comes round, have a chat. How's she feeling?
Is she going to sue? You know the drill.
When you were picking up my things, was there any mail?
  Bills.
  Oh...
Your mother used to do all that.
  I know.
  Have you spoken to her?
Yes.
She's not coming back, is she?
I don't think so.
  It's ridiculous you having to do this.
  Yeah, I know.
Why can't they employ proper nurses?
"Back in my day..."
Yes, all right. Are they doing it deliberately?
I'm sorry to interrupt. Police have just called. It's not good.
  Police?
  It's all right, Dad, it's just a patient.
Ben, the police tried your friend's number. His wife answered.
He never had the phone with him.
The CAA are going to put a helicopter up and try to locate him.
He only has enough propane for eight hours. I've got to go.
  Ahh!
  No, Ben...
  Ben, you need to lie still.
No, it's my fault he's up there!
You may be suffering from post operative confusion.
You're in danger of doing yourself serious harm.
What if it was your friend? Would you do nothing? Please...
Listen. What you did was very brave but you really need to lie still.
  Brave? I let go! I let go of the rope!
  10mg of diazepam.
You can't keep me here!
Just let go of my arm!
We really don't need to do that.
Nurse, please!
Just try and talk to him.
Fantastic!
Problem solved.
Consultants' office, five minutes.
Be prepared. Face is trippin' her.
What's she said?
That's it, she's not said a word.
She's been giving it the daggers.
Hi, Lainey. I've read your notes. You've got your new pacemaker.
All good.
We can talk about what happened.
Can I get you some water or some...?
Sling your hook!
Oh, my God, my voice. What have you done to me?
What's wrong with me?
You can't do that. I'm a consultant,
you can't criticise me in front of my staff.
There's no one else here, you don't have to pull rank.
That was a work situation.
Yeah, yeah. That was all about work.
I made a professional decision. You undermined it. Why?
  Because I defended my father?
  Because you took the easy choice.
What?
This, you and me. If you use your father as an excuse
to destroy this then you're going right back to square one.
Toxicology on Corey Eagles. Well, when, for goodness' sake?
Fine.
Have you treated him before?
  No.
  I bet he'd have more to say than you would.
  What?
  You know, even with just his eyelids.
Bet it's not all one blink and that's your lot.
He's a travel writer.
Anthropologist. Been everywhere before he was out of his twenties.
Both poles, Borneo, Amazon.
Made contact with the Andaman Islanders.
They'd lived in complete isolation for 60,000 years.
  But they accepted him.
  Yeah? And?
His first book, it's called Live Every Day
and I found it in a backpackers' hostel I'd been staying in Sydney.
It was as if someone had left it just for me.
It changed your life?
You change your own life.
He still writes. He's halfway through a book now.
See, wasn't so difficult, was it?
Got an interesting one for you.
Came in talking like Barbara Windsor,
now she sounds like Frankie Boyle.
Maybe she's jocking.
I think she's genuine. I've been online.
FAS, foreign accent syndrome.
Can be caused by a blow to the head.
Right, so she's the one who fell out of bed.
Yes.
It's ATS   acute thespian syndrome.
  I don't...
  She had a fall, she wants her day in court.
I don't know what her problem is.
She should be proud talking like that.
Yeah, part of the nation that gave us The Krankies.
Anyway, I thought she sounded kind of sexy.
And the sooner you get your independence the better.
What?
Nothing, just smiling.
Don't.
Were they talking about me?
We were discussing your case.
We think you may be suffering from foreign accent syndrome.
Do you think it's funny?
No, I don't. I think there's a reason for it.
I want to help you.
Mr Hemingway. You were just on your way to see me.
  No, I wasn't.
  Well you should have been.
Have we made a decision yet?
  We?
  Given your contribution, which has been adequate,
it's within my gift to offer you a permanent contract.
Erm...I'll have to think it over.
I must admit, I thought you'd reject it out of hand.
I thought you valued your freedom too highly.
  Depends how you define freedom.
  Indeed.
One can of course be bounded in a nutshell
and count yourself a king of infinite space.
Wise words.
Fundamental error, though, to put them in the mouth of a Dane.
Let me know your decision within two hours, please.
Erm, what did Hanssen want?
My contract ends today.
You didn't think that was worth mentioning?
Bed five. He's struggling to breathe.
  Do you want to intubate?
  No. We'd have to sedate him. CPAP.
If he should vomit which is a strong possibility
with hypotension...
We'll keep him monitored. Nurse McKee...CPAP.
Are you sure?
We get one flash between two endless voids   his words.
If this is the end, do you think he'd want to be sedated?
Thank you.
It's your call. Sats 83 and dropping.
  Where's his wife?
  She just left.
Could you get her for me, as soon as possible?
What're you doing?
Where's your jacket?
I don't know.
It must get pretty cold in a balloon, right?
But when they brought you in, you were in a T shirt.
Jacket must be in the rig.
With your phone in the pocket.
My phone? It's in the balloon!
I'll call the police.
Wait, that will just waste time.
I'll talk to him. I'll talk him down.
Mr Hanssen?
Ah, Dr Lo, I read your page.
Theraproxamine.
Mimicking an oedema, an infection of some kind, resulting in rejection...
Needs further research, of course, but it's promising.
What did you want to see me about?
Very good.
I'd like you to run through the vowels for me, please.
There's a rational explanation for this.
Excellent.
You don't have a Scottish accent, Ms Craig, but your speech
merely contains intonation we associate with parts of Scotland.
I'm from Penge. How I talked   that was me.
It's like waking up and discovering you're someone else.
Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
and found himself transformed into a giant insect.
What ward's he on?
And what do we deduce from this?
Ms Craig suffered wounds to the frontal area of the skull.
A piece of shrapnel may have become dislodged by her fall
blocking blood flow to the speech centre of the brain.
And how do we proceed?
I'd like to carry out an MRI.
I look forward to the result with interest. Good afternoon.
Look, can we just do it?
Come on. Come on.
It's in my jacket pocket.
Try to stay calm.
Alex! It's Ben! Thank God you're alive.
  'Mate! You've got to get me down!'
  OK, OK then listen,
I'm going to talk you down.
You need to pull the cord to open the parachute valve, OK?
'What are you talking about?'
Alex? Can you hear me? Alex?
I'm sorry.
Have you seen Nurse McKee?
She said it was your last day. It isn't, is it?
Doesn't really answer my question.
She seemed upset.
I found her walking along the edge.
  Did she say anything?
  She just told me to stay back.
Anything else?
Nothing that made any sense.
What? What did she say?
Propiti...
  Propitiation?
  Yeah.
OK if I join you?
Go away.
I'm just going to sit over here, OK? I won't get too close.
I just want some time to myself.
It's an Andaman Islanders belief, isn't it?
To gain the gods' favour, you take an equal risk.
To save a life, you risk a life.
You got him breathing again?
Yes.
How long's he got?
He's not getting any stronger...
How long? Days? Hours?
A few hours.
I can't be without him.
Have you any idea how that feels?
You fall in love, it's a long way down.
What was all that about?
I mean, I obviously know what that was about
but what were you even thinking, Luc?
  If she'd fallen, she'd have taken you over the edge?
  She didn't, did she?
But she could have done. Look at her. She's obviously a nut job.
Are we having our first domestic?
Why didn't you tell me, that this was your last day?
Hanssen's offered me a permanent contract.
And I bet you told him he could stick it.
Before last night I probably would have said no.
But I woke up this morning, it was a new day.
What does that even mean, Luc?
It means I'm going to accept.
What's life without a few risks?
What is wrong with you?
  Got a task.
  Oh.
When you've finished your lunch.
  I need...
Maybe that could wait.
Sorry.
I need someone to go over Mr Hamilton's care plan with him.
Oh.
Certain people don't believe that you can do it.
I told them, nobody's better at dealing with difficult patients.
You said that?
We show the doubters what Nurse Lane is made of.
I can eat anytime.
  Erm, you spell it...
  It's OK.
The machine knows what you mean better than you know what you mean.
Zoey... Zoey, listen to me...
I need you to move back so we can treat him. Zoey!
  Zoey!
  Zoey!
Could you step out of the way, please, so we can work?
  Respiratory arrest.
  Stay with him, just stay out the way.
  Corey...
  Laryngoscope.
I love you!
  I love you.
  Zoey, Zoey we need to give the doctors some space.
  Let's go and get a coffee.
  I love you! I love you!
  I want to be with him!
  I know you do but they need space to work.
I want to be with him!
  His pulse is dropping.
  Need to get a neck line in, start inotropes.
Rigor mortis... What's causing this?
Botulinum?
Ciguatera?
His heart's failing... we're just staving the inevitable.
Luc, I've just spoken to toxicology. They've got nothing.
Why wasn't his wife in the ambulance?
This isn't right.
  Is he all right?
  That stunt on the roof.
Was it to save him or kill him?
  You have no idea.
  He has a right to live.
It's what he wanted!
What did you give him?
  We had a pact.
  You mean YOU had a pact.
No! We were up all night talking about it...
we thought he'd slip away. But he didn't.
He started fighting to breathe.
I needed to know if he'd changed his mind...
but he couldn't move his eyelids.
What did you give him?
If I tell you, I'll lose him.
You'll "lose" him?
I'll go to prison.
You do not have the right to take another person's life.
I did it because I love him.
What did you give him?
I gave him mivacurium.
Thank you.
Could you just give us a minute, please? Thank you.
His heartbeat's really faint.
What are you giving him?
You know if you give him the wrong thing you're going to kill him.
Luc?
Mr Hamilton?
Sorry to wake you.
I just need to go over a few things before you leave us.
We want to make sure you get all the help you're entitled to.
I just want to ask a few questions first.
What's your date of birth?
Mind your own business.
It's OK. You're like my mum.
Am I? In what possible way could I be like your dear old mum?
I mean, she's funny about her age too.
It's all right, I'll get it off your chart. Are you married?
Is this a wind up?
No, it's on the form...
Who put you up to this?
Nobody.
Tell me their name.
  It's stage two.
  What?
Your diagnosis. I've been reading about it.
You must've raced through denial.
Now you're on anger. Well done.
Excuse me! Could someone remove the moron from my bedside?
I'm not a moron.
You're doing a brilliant impersonation. Excuse me!
If I was one of the male doctors, you'd treat me with respect.
You put on this charm
but underneath you're just a mean old fashioned bully.
Mr Griffin. Someone else can deal with Jeremy.
And I'm sorry if I'm letting you down, but my mum and dad
didn't bring me up to let people be rude and horrible to me.
You are aware of his diagnosis?
Good manners cost nothing.
And I don't care if that sounds dumb, it's still true.
I'm sorry.
I know this must be really hard and I know he's probably scared
and everything, but it doesn't give him the right to treat me like that.
  Like what?
  It's OK, Chantelle. You go and finish your lunch. Go on.
It's the...balloon guy.
  This can wait.
  What did he do?
He's not coping well with vulnerability.
I'll talk to him.
You need to prioritise your...
This was my fault, not Chantelle's.
I should never have asked her to do it.
This is ridiculous.
You're not really cut out for a career in crime, are you?
  Sorry?
  Well, on the day you're offered a permanent contract
you put your career in jeopardy by covering up an attempted murder.
I mean, am I sensing a hint of ambivalence here, Luc?
Eddi...
Neostigmine. Antidote to mivacurium.
Which, I'm guessing, she kept from her days as a pharmacist.
Well, if that were true it'd make you an accomplice.
Partners in crime, I think that's the phrase.
That would make me a partner.
Unless, of course, you want to go it alone.
It's not easy, is it?
It's not meant to be easy.
Daunting prospect...empty house.
Daniel, I don't need your touchy feely yip yap,
but I will not be made a fool of!
Nobody's making a fool out of you.
I suppose they sent you out here to give me a lecture?
  Sometimes you say things...
they probably sound worse than you mean them to.
  You're taking his side?
  Whose side?
The nurse's.
Dad, the nurse you spoke to was Nurse Lane. Chantelle.
Don't try to bamboozle me.
Have you seen the way he looks at you?
I've no idea what you're talking about.
Like he thinks there's something between you!
We go back a long way. I told you, we played rugby together.
  You know what I'm talking about.
  Dad, I'm neglecting my patients.
So, go. Go to your patients.
I didn't ask you to come looking for me.
These things... I sound ridiculous.
You'll be fine.
Every procedure I have makes it worse.
  I promise. You just lie...
  What if this goes wrong as well?
OK...you know what? I'll show you how easy it is.
Just go in there with Suzanna.
Where were you?
Chest pains, tachycardic, straining to breathe.
  Any news?
  Yes, I just showed him.
It's still in the air about a mile north of here.
It's been on the news all day.
Cyanosis. Low sats and tachycardic. Possible pulmonary embolism.
Anticoagulants too high risk.
Even heparin could cause a bleed. Plus we've lost the theatre option.
We do nothing, he could die. Are you sure it's a DVT?
I'm sure.
It's your call.
OK...chest X ray, CT angio.
If positive then IV heparin infusion,
5,000 units then 18 units per kilo per hour.
And hourly obs.
That's it. We're all done.
I'll get the neurosurgeon to have a look.
Hopefully he'll be able to remove the shrapnel
and get you back to normal.
Thanks.
The porter will take you back. I'll catch you up.
What's going to happen to me?
You won't be going to prison, if that's what you mean.
We've organised a care home for Corey.
Why would I possibly want that?
Because you need some help.
Every second I'm with him is priceless.
We had a crisis...
I think Nurse McKee is just a little concerned you might have another.
If we do, we'll weather it together.
There you go then. I mean, that solves that, right?
Happy ever after.
Home soon.
  Come in.
Sit down, please.
As you know, I was very interested in the results of Ms Craig's MRI.
Your diagnosis was correct.
Where you erred was in telling the patient that it was operable.
No neurosurgeon would risk so invasive a procedure.
Well, there must be something...
I can understand why you need to believe something
can always be done. Especially in matters neurological.
To put the patient at her ease, I believe you demonstrated
the scanner on yourself.
The radiographer saw the result of your scan.
Out of concern, she forwarded it to me.
As you are no doubt aware, you have a brain tumour.
Luc, I've made a decision.
  Have you? Can I tell you mine first?
  No.
Well, I've spoken to Hanssen and I've accepted the contract.
Who'd have thought, Luc Hemingway tamed at last.
Right. Sushi. Tonight. No arguments.
  He's one of us now. See? Marvellous.
  Thank you.
So what was your decision?
No more nights on a single bed.
It's not a big deal or anything.
Yours is really convenient but mine is more comfortable so...
The scan...
it showed no change in the tumour   it hasn't changed for years.
Can't I just go back to work?
You know that's out of the question.
I realise I should have told you...
Doctor Lo, sooner or later your condition
will put a patient at risk.
It was against the ethics of this profession not to divulge it.
I refused an operation when I was 18 to remove the tumour.
Do you want to know why?
Because of the risk of brain damage.
Dr Lo...
That's how much I wanted to be a doctor!
Please don't take that away from me.
That will be a decision for the Trust.
Please.
Doctor Lo, let us not leap to conclusions.
You will need a neurological assessment.
When we know the results of that,
then we can decide what's the best course of action to take.
So I can go back to work as normal until then?
No. I'm sorry, you can't.
I have to suspend you from duty with immediate effect.
Mr Hamilton? I just need to change your dressing.
I'd prefer a nurse other than you to change my dressing.
I'm sure you understand.
Fine.
I do have to just go over a few things with you before you leave.
Pain management, wound care...
Time was a nurse abused a patient, his feet wouldn't touch the ground.
Some people are unsackable, aren't they?
Okey dokey. I'm just going to leave these here
and you can read them in your own time...
if you want. I'll send over another nurse when one is free.
In the meantime, if you wouldn't mind signing for this medication
  then we're done.
  Leave it there, I'll sign when I'm ready.
I'd prefer if you sign it now.
  I said...
  I'm asking you politely to sign this now.
I said I'd sign it when I'm ready!
Is this what I get for having the temerity to complain?
  What's the problem here?
  Do you think I don't know what's going on?
Consultant for 35 years. Teach the old gimmer a lesson.
See how he reacts to someone like that.
Somebody like what?
I want my son down here. I want to see him now!
Jeremy, you didn't answer my question.
I think it's best if we let this one go.
Someone like you. Professional Nancy boy.
  You can't use language like that.
  Like what?
  You know what I'm talking about.
  I want my son down here.
I want to see him now!
'OK, we know what's wrong with you.'
You have a pulmonary embolism blocking the artery
to your left lung.
We need to wait and see how it responds to anticoagulants.
I have mates who hate rugby but they know all the rules.
If you're anything like me, you've probably banged on about
ballooning so much your mate could land the thing in his sleep.
So why hasn't he?
Couldn't open the parachute valve.
Dan, it's your dad, he's going crazy.
Give the buffer the dodgy nurse, bet on how much it'll raise his B/P,
then dump on him from a great sanctimonious height
when he complains. I know the tricks.
Dad, this isn't helping.
Daniel. Get my clothes! Had enough of this place.
We need to change your dressing.
  I did offer to change...
  Stay out of this! Please? Can you do that?
My son is capable of changing a bandage, thank you.
Your son is monitoring a post op patient.
You think I'd let myself be treated by him so you could all laugh?
  Mr Hamilton, I'm sorry that you feel this way...
  Look at him.
Rugger player? Give me a break!
  Dad, that's enough.
  He was only in it for the showers!
  Will you please stop?
  You raise your voice to me?
Simon is a good, compassionate
professional and your behaviour,
I'm ashamed to say, has probably lost him his job.
Are you going to stand there
and take the side of a fruit against your own father?
A fruit?
When I was a boy, I always used to wonder why you were so angry
when you called somebody that.
What was wrong with them? Had to be something bad, something dirty.
All those words   "Nancy boy", "bender".
A boy looks to his father to show him how to be a man.
I loved you so much.
I tried so hard to be the man you told me to be,
but all those hate filled words, Dad,
that was me you were describing,
your own son.
I'm not "confused". I'm not experimenting. I'm not bisexual.
I'm gay.
And the only thing I regret is how many decent people
I betrayed before I could say that.
I'm sorry, Lainey, they won't be able to operate.
Will I have to go to another hospital?
No one will do it. It doesn't merit the risk.
We can offer you some course in speech therapy.
Maybe you can get some compensation...
I don't want compensation! I want to be myself again!
I want to be myself...
Embolus responding to treatment. Good.
What you did back there...
Yeah...about time.
Ben...look.
He must have opened the parachute valve.
Look at the way he's using the burner...
You must've bored him rigid.
Yeah, I must have.
Sure.
Hell of a floor show.
Who's going to tell Chantelle?
She's going to be heartbroken, you know that?
You saw what Jeremy was like and now you're
dismissing her because she wasn't prepared to stand for it.
I liked that.
What?
Didn't know she had it in her.
But...I just saw Simon...
Yeah, I think we should keep them both.
Right...good.
Erm, how're you going to explain that to Hanssen?
Can I just say...?
Did you really mean all that or were you just saying it
to wind up your old man?
Waited my whole life to say that.
Well, you didn't say it very well.
I mean, where was the marching band? The chorus line?
You could've at least finished on a song.
Are there classes? Got a lot of catching up to do.
Not that much.
Dan...
I'll wait for you.
