At some point, we all dream
of a new start in life far away from our troubles.
But can the reality of moving to the other side of the world
live up to those dreams, especially when you know the pain that moving
will cause you and the people you love?
Rob Boraston is desperate for a new start Down Under
and his partner David isn't so sure.
It's a big risk for me. It's a big chance to take.
  After a week experiencing the ups...
  That's really nice.
I'm so blown away. I'm not even properly breathing.
  It has to go uphill.
It has to be so much better than this.
They'll face the toughest decision of their lives.
I really don't know how David and I are going to make this monumental decision.
But will they choose the life they know or a new start on the other side of the world?
For thousands of Brits every year, New Zealand offers
the dream of an ideal life set amongst some epic surroundings.
However, the dream doesn't always work out and for many immigrants,
their journey can end right back where they started.
But with nearly a quarter of its population born overseas,
there's no shortage of new arrivals,
keen to find out if New Zealand could be the place for them.
Rob Boraston and David Andrews have been together for 18 years.
The week ahead could be the most important of their lives.
After experiencing the reality of life in New Zealand,
they face a huge decision.
Whether to stay in the UK or to make the move for good.
To get there means crossing 11,000 miles,
three continents and facing 24 hours of in flight movies.
No wonder it can leave the best of us feeling a little jaded.
Right now, I'm feeling incredibly tired but incredibly excited about what lies ahead
and the chances and opportunities we've got in the next few days.
It has hit home how far away it is.
In the run up to actually coming out, my emotions have been doing
a whole up and down thing.
Ahead of Rob and David is a big week sampling life in New Zealand.
It couldn't be further away from the one they know.
Back in the UK, home is in the town of Honiton in Devon,
where they've lived for the past 13 years.
Primary school teacher Rob, 42, lives with his 38 year old partner,
David, a senior support worker.
They met 18 years ago at university and moved to Devon soon after.
That's nothing compared with the move they're currently facing.
This has largely come from my desire to do something different,
to go and live somewhere different
because it is easy to stay in the same place.
After visiting three years ago with his mother,
Rob fell in love with the idea of a move Down Under.
Illness put all his plans on hold.
Rob's illness and Rob being unwell has controlled everything
that we've been able to do. It has been quite debilitating.
I'd like to mention that it is ulcerative colitis that I've had
because lots of people in the country do suffer with it
and it's not really known about until you know somebody that's got it.
You can't leave the house because you constantly need the toilet.
Which is a bit embarrassing but that's what it's been like.
Throughout his illness, Rob's been able to rely on one thing  
the support of his partner, David.
He's my partner but he's my best friend. As long as we're with each other,
we'll be fine. It doesn't matter where we go, we'll be all right.
It's taken three years of treatment and major surgery,
but Rob is finally on the mend.
In the last few weeks I've really felt that actually
I feel well for the first time in years.
Now is the perfect time for us to be doing this.
I've got a clean bill of health from the hospital, so...
However, while Rob may be ready for a new start, David has his doubts.
It's a big risk for me, a big chance to take but it would be easier if
we could go out there and I could think, "Oh, no, I don't like it."
When you're trying to persuade somebody to move
to the other side of the world, if they've never seen that country,
you're on a bit of an uphill struggle trying to get them
to actually visualise themselves being there.
David's a real thinker and analyses and thinks
about things in great detail to make sure that they are just right.
Convincing David that New Zealand offers a better future could be
a big challenge for Rob and he knows that it will come at a high price.
Leaving my mum behind would be really hard.
I think she's worried that she wouldn't see us again.
Not having her there for Sunday lunch
or going for a walk along the beach would be really hard.
She's a brilliant support, she always has been. Always will be.
It's guaranteed to be a tough choice
but Rob and David both know what could be on offer.
This is an amazing opportunity for us to do something for us.
We could end up in ten years' time thinking,
"Oh well, we did have this opportunity,
"we could have done it but we didn't do it."
  I don't want that to happen.
  It's a really scary prospect.
Both Rob and David know just how much is riding on their decision.
Rob's desperate for a new start after years of ill health
but knows the pain a move would cause.
With David's doubts, New Zealand will have to convince them both
that making the move would be worth it.
Rob and David want to find out
if New Zealand's capital city of Wellington could be
the ideal location for their new start.
Home for the week is the rural area of Lower Hutt,
20 minutes north east of the city centre.
With plenty of countryside close by and the city within reach,
it should be an ideal setting for the week ahead.
  Looks interesting.
  It does look interesting. Nice location.
A very nice location.
This one bedroom workman's cottage is typical of accommodation
in rural New Zealand but what will they make of their new home.
  OK. Its compact and bijou.
  Looks like a sort of 1920s beach hut.
It is a bit like a beach hut.
It just feels a little bit shabby.
I think, Rob's expectations of where we're going to stay were higher.
It's a bit dated and it's just not what we're used to
but there's certainly nothing wrong with it.
To be honest, there's part of me that I could just go and check into a hotel.
I reckon, by the end of the week, we'll probably really like it. We probably will.
Taking the house as a starting point for our experience
of New Zealand, I think it can only get better.
It has to go uphill, it has to be so much better than this
and I'm sure it will be.
Despite the picturesque setting,
their first impressions of New Zealand aren't good.
It is quite small.
Back in the UK, Rob and David live in a three bedroom detached home
on the outskirts of Honiton in Devon.
They believe it's worth around £230,000 and they are
looking for something of similar value in New Zealand.
But if they're going to give up a home they love and have worked
hard to restore, then property Down Under will have to impress.
Our dream house would be somewhere that is fairly rural, doesn't need
to have lots of land because land means lots of maintenance.
Having neighbours close enough but not right on top of us would be fantastic.
Just an interesting property. Just something maybe a bit different.
A bit of character and a wood burner, quite important.
Yeah, 1950s style house.
Selling the house would be a necessity for us.
I think you have to go to New Zealand thinking positive,
that it will work and going and putting down roots
and buying a house would be part of that process.
We are giving Rob and David a taste of Wellington's housing market.
We'll show them three typical options based upon what they want
from their ideal home, what they can afford
and the real cost of property Down Under.
After seeing for themselves what's on offer,
we'll reveal the price of each of the houses.
The search begins in the small town of Silverstream,
20 minutes' drive north east of the city.
It's a rural area popular with walkers
and should be ideal for Rob and David's love of the outdoors.
This house is a four bedroom detached property
on a large plot of land overlooking the bush.
Will it get things off to a good start?
  It's nice and warm in here.
  Nice wood burner.
  Definitely.
It's nice, quite open plan, isn't it?
It actually feels like you're just sitting in the garden in here.
A kettle, right, we got the kitchen here. Dining area. The sitting area.
  I think it's a really nice space. It's a lovely room.
  It is really nice.
I really like this house, I could imagine living here.
  It's quite a good size.
  It is a good size.
  And the bathroom.
  This is really nice.
  A good sized bathroom.
It's a really good size with a huge shower.
  It all looks quite new, doesn't it?
  It does.
Looks like someone's put this in quite recently. Master bedroom.
  A nice big room.
  It's a nice big room.
And we've got a door that goes out on to the verandah.
That's really nice, isn't it? It's good.
Outside there's a large garden.
Rob and David didn't want land but could this appeal to them?
  Wow, check that out. This is quite a nice little area, isn't it?
  It is.
That view is stunning.
Having such a large garden could be a big plus
but there could be a downside too.
  All these planks, is it because...
  It's rotten.
It is, they really need replacing. For sure, would be a lot of money.
And a lot of work to do the whole of all that decking.
It looks as if Rob and David are impressed with the house,
if not the amount of work that needs doing to it.
But can they afford it with their £230,000 budget?
I think the location is going to put the price up, really.
I don't think we'll be able to afford it anyway.
  I think it's probably over...
  the overall budget.
  Ah, £219,000.
  Or 410,000.
  I don't think I'd be prepared to pay that for this house.
  Neither would I.
You're going to need to spend a lot of money
on these windows, flooring, general work outside.
You're paying for the land and the location and that is amazing.
However, it would be too much for us to take on board.
Moving to New Zealand is one thing but moving to New Zealand
and taking on a big project like this
  is just a little bit beyond what we would be able to do.
  Definitely.
At £11,000 under budget, it is an affordable option, but this house
hasn't convinced Rob and only added to David's doubts about moving.
Could the second house fare any better?
It's in the sought after area of Eastbourne, just across the harbour
from the city centre with beaches, cafes and shops all close by.
This three bedroom timber built house should offer plenty of space
and a smaller garden, but can it win over Rob and David?
  This looks really good.
  It does. Absolutely.
I bet it's going to have some spectacular views.
Well, that's a much better start.
Oh, wow. Wow, this is lovely.
  Just the windows!
  That's fantastic, isn't it?
What an amazing, amazing location.
  That's another of those wood burners.
  That will belt out some heat.
That's really, really nice. Kitchen with dining and living.
  You wouldn't have to change anything, would you?
  You wouldn't need to change a thing in here.
It is just like, "When can we move in?"
It's just gutting because you kind of think,
you'll love it but I can't imagine we would be able to afford
something like this.
  Look at that, just the rock face there. Wow.
  It's amazing, isn't it?
  Just look at that.
  It's incredible, isn't it?
That's priceless, a view like that. This is just perfect.
  Yeah, gobsmacked.
  The views have won Rob over
and David's response is just what he was hoping for.
Oh my goodness. Oh, wow!
Sea view. This is an unbelievable property.
I don't know what to say really. It's just phenomenal, isn't it, really?
What a huge room as well and en suite.
With its stylish interiors,
this house seems to be getting better and better.
The last house we bought
we knew that we wanted to buy it as soon as we were outside it.
I've got that same feeling with this house.
I can see us in here, our furniture's in here.
We could live here really, really happily. Definitely.
It's one of those gut feeling houses that you just know is right.
That's a pretty big turnaround and David's worries
seem like a distant memory.
But is this house too good to be true?
Will their budget of £230,000 be able to keep up with their dreams?
If it was within our price range
and we could afford to buy it, then that's really
going to put the pressure on us to make a decision.
One of the things we had said is that to move to New Zealand,
the house that we'd be looking at would have to be an improvement on
  what we're at the moment and this certainly is. Are you ready?
  Yeah.
£246,000, which is just under the 250.
  Quite expensive.
  Yeah.
I'm a bit disappointed because I just think
that would be pushing ourselves too much.
Yeah, but I'd definitely like to know how long it's been on the market,
why they want to sell it. That's the sort of questions I would be asking
because I'd be really serious about wanting to buy this house.
If you can secure a house like this,
it would be another factor for moving to New Zealand, definitely.
David's enthusiasm is great news for Rob, but it comes at a price.
If finding the right house is going to push their finances,
will the final property offer them answers or more questions?
It's in the Paraparaumu area of the Kapiti Coast
on the outskirts of Wellington.
Close to the beach, this ultra modern four bedroom house
has plenty of room for visitors and is in an idyllic location.
But can it offer Rob and David an ideal home and price?
  Absolutely beautiful.
  Beautiful, yeah. It really is.
  It's stunning.
  The views!
  This is a dream home for us.
  It would be, wouldn't it?
I can't even speak. I literally can't even get the words to describe.
That doesn't happen very often, that he's stuck for words.
What a lovely room.
I'm so blown away, I'm not even properly breathing.
It's just incredible, actually.
Isn't it? I wonder how much you get for a kidney.
I think we'd need to sell all four.
I think that means Rob and David like this house
but we're only getting started.
Wow.
I just can't imagine waking up to that every morning.
I almost don't want to see any more of it
because it is a phenomenal house, this.
  You all right?
  Yeah.
With so much riding on his decision,
it's an overwhelming experience for David.
  There's yet more to see downstairs.
  Wow, look at that view.
It just goes on. Even more. It's just beautiful.
All this space would be perfect for having visitors from home,
and a huge bathroom is the icing on the cake.
With just the outside to view, the question is,
is it all too good to be true?
Check that out, that's just incredible, isn't it?
If we could possibly afford something like this,
I'd be absolutely blown away.
This is what I aspire to live in.
Rob and David have fallen in love with this house.
It offers everything they are looking for in New Zealand and more.
Will its price put a swift end to the dream?
I don't think we could afford this house for a second.
If we can, then we are moving to New Zealand. Without a shadow of a doubt.
  Without a shadow of a doubt, we're coming.
  Yeah.
If I had £428,000, I would buy this house now.
  I would sign the dotted line.
  Yeah.
  Straight away.
  I don't suppose they're open to silly offers.
  Crazy offers.
Crazy offers, yeah.
The boys have found their perfect home and even David
seems ready to move in today, but it's nearly £200,000 over budget.
They've seen three very different options today.
The first house was affordable but it left Rob cold
and David with big doubts about New Zealand.
The second wowed the boys with its good looks
but the price was far less attractive.
The final property offered a genuine dream home
but would mean going into huge debt.
So, after a day of house hunting, have the boys
seen enough to justify a move to the other side of the world?
Based on the three properties we've seen today, our vote goes to...
New Zealand!
I'm quite surprised that David voted for New Zealand
but after seeing the properties today,
I sort of thought that maybe he would in the end.
I felt that the standard of the properties was fantastic
and really exceeded what we would be able to get in the UK
for our money in the future.
Finding a dream house was great news for Rob and David.
However, the price tag was anything but.
With the houses they liked above and beyond their budget,
it puts the pressure on both of them to find good work opportunities.
Back in Honiton, David is a support worker for adults
with learning difficulties and Rob is a primary school teacher.
David currently works 40 hours a week and his duties include
helping his clients with all aspects of their daily life.
Ideal scenario for me would be
to continue working with people with a learning disability
in a supported living environment,
and to facilitate people around them to help them
reach their aspirations and to reach their full potential as individuals.
And after so long with illness,
Rob wants to take full advantage of being healthy again.
I'm full of energy and I'm ready to get out and start working again.
It doesn't matter where I'll be teaching,
it's just about getting back into work and doing what I love doing.
Both of their jobs are on the skilled occupation list but Rob
is the main visa applicant, so it's crucial that he can find work.
See you later. Have fun!
I am feeling a little bit happy to be going into the school today,
purely because I've been in the same school for 14 years.
It's the first school I've ever taught in other than that with
people I don't know, kids I don't know, routines I don't know.
But, a challenge.
He's spending the morning at a local primary school
on the outskirts of Wellington, where he's met by the principal.
  Good morning, Rob. I'm Ian, the principal of Tawa School. Welcome.
  Great to meet you.
It's important that Rob makes a good impression
so today he's taking a class
to see if his skills could transfer to New Zealand.
While Rob's settling in, David's also out and about.
With his concerns about moving,
it's vital he finds work he can enjoy and pays the right salary.
I've worked with people with a learning disability now
for the last 14 years, so it's kind of the path that I've taken
and I need to and want to continue with that.
He's arranged to meet the general manager of a local Adult Learning Centre.
  G'day, David. Susan Gray.
  Hi, I'm David Andrews. Nice to meet you.
And it's straight to work, teaching a class.
You like lions and tigers, do you?
That's something that you could say just for a day trip or something.
Might make you think of all sorts of other things.
As David gets to work,
Rob is taking his own class on a subject close to home.
Jot down things you know or think you know about the UK.
Anything at all.
Can you tell just because there's lots of people that it's England?
What does that tell you about New Zealand and the UK then?
After spending the morning with his class, David's been asked
to join Susan and a colleague to discuss some important news.
  G'day again, David.
  Hi.
  How are you?
  Good, thank you.
  Good.
David, we are likely to have
a senior vacancy here after 22nd September.
If you make the final decision to come here,
whether you would be interested in looking at a job?
I would be very interested.
Could I ask what the annual salary would be for that position?
  Salary is between about 45 and 50,000.
  Right.
There would be other things included like a car.
That is better, actually, than what I'm earning now
and I don't have a car with the position that I'm working to.
It's a great result.
With his experience David could earn at least £28,000 plus a car
and there's more to come.
Meeting David today was wonderful.
I believe that if he wanted to come here,
we would be in a position to offer him a permanent job.
After just one day at work,
David could have walked straight into a new career.
I feel as if I've had an interview and almost been offered a job,
or certainly been invited to apply for a senior position.
What more could I ask for, to be honest, it's amazing. What an experience.
So can Rob also come up with good work prospects?
Come and put your post it notes up here.
Anybody think they know anything about the UK?
Chloe...
There's a place called Newcastle in England
and people from Newcastle are called Geordies.
Fantastic.
The lessons have gone well but there's a few important questions to be answered
before Rob can make up his mind.
Could you tell me something about what kind of salary I might expect to receive in New Zealand?
For an experienced teacher, you go straight to the top of the classroom teacher's scale,
which is about 67,000. You're welcome to have that piece of paper.
Based on that, that's only fractionally less than I'm earning in the UK anyway.
I thought it was going to be a lot less than that,
I thought I was looking at 10,000 less.
Despite earning a smaller salary than he's on at home, is still a good result from Rob.
But the crucial question is, is there work to go with it?
Our schools have a lot in common, so we're about to advertise jobs
and Rob would be very welcome to apply and I'm sure he'd be seriously considered.
The whole of our future and our future in New Zealand
was hanging on there being a job and a job offer.
Now that's actually looking like it might be in place,
or there's a potential for that, it is looking more real.
This could be happening. We could be changing our lives completely.
It's been a day of real promise for Rob and David
but moving will mean leaving behind jobs they both love.
Will they be persuaded by what they have what they could have?
Based on our work experiences today, we're going to vote for...
New Zealand.
Our job prospects seem really good.
We set out to start a new challenge, to start a new life
and if that can become a reality, we have to go for it.
I've been as good as offered a job opportunity,
erm... which exceeds, really, the role that I have in the UK.
Well, it's hard to imagine Rob and David's work experience going any better.
But, with so much promise, affording the move now hinges
on how much they can raise from the sale of their UK home.
With house prices in New Zealand coming as a surprise
it's vital they get a good price for their UK home.
The boys are hoping for £230,000,
but will two local estate agents agree?
Nice neutral colours, that's good.
  Our house looks really smart, doesn't it?
  It does.
A nice modern kitchen. Nice and neutral.
Built in oven, hob and hood.
No problems there.
A good spacious room, the fireplace is a nice feature. Nice, light and airy.
A decent sized dining room, off the kitchen, which helps giving nice access to the garden.
They've done a good job of the kitchen. Fully fitted appliances. It's a lovely kitchen, actually.
Nice of him to say so.
Excellent ensuite, they've finished it to a really high standard.
That's a nice single. Good child's room. Could be used as a study.
I would suggest that, in its current state and the market,
this house would be valued somewhere in the region of 240,000.
For a quick sale, I'd suggest something in the region of about 225,000 to 230,000.
In the current market, I'd recommend an asking price of 240,000.
For a quick sale, if they're wanting to reduce it accordingly,
I would say an asking price of £225,000.
  Wow!
  That's really good.
  I'm really pleased, it's more than I thought it was going to be.
  Yes.
We've increased the value of the property.
A valuation like that gives us a bit more scope,
a bit more to play with in terms of the kind of house we can start looking at.
Absolutely, it does.
But their house is only part of the package.
We prepared a breakdown of their costs of living in New Zealand
and, based on their calculations, they'll find out if the sums add up.
  My monthly salary for New Zealand would be around about £3,000.
  And mine?
  That's more than you're earning in the UK.
  For a lot less hours.
  Now we need to start looking at mortgage repayments.
So, in the UK, our mortgage is £1,200 a month.
In New Zealand, an equivalent mortgage,
£1,018. Water...
In the UK, we pay £69 per month.
Water usage is free in Wellington.
So, we're looking at a weekly shopping list...
So, what's the bottom line? Are they going to be better or worse off?
  Plus 1,833.
So, in New Zealand, we will be £41 a month better off.
  We're not actually gaining but we're not losing.
  Yeah.
  Financially.
New Zealand has come out on top but not by much.
So, is a move going to be worth the sacrifice if there's no real financial gain?
Based on the cost of living comparisons between the UK
and New Zealand, we are going to choose...
New Zealand.
  But I'm quite surprised.
  Me too.
  I thought we'd be choosing the UK.
  Absolutely, yeah.
I thought we would have done as well.
With the figures looking good, and David feeling more positive
about life in Wellington, Rob's dream has taken a big step forward.
But this move has never been about money.
It's about the two of them starting a new chapter together.
Today, they're heading out
to enjoy some of the rewards of the New Zealand lifestyle.
Their both keen to learn more about wine.
Martinborough, east of Wellington, should be a great location to give them some thinking time.
There are more than 25 vineyards in the area
and, along with a driver, the first stop is at one of the oldest.
  It's a nice place.
  It does. Very nice.
This is our reserve.
It's quite delicate and quite complex.
Some really nice flavours in it.
That's really nice. It's got like a... Almost a peppery aftertaste.
That seems to be going down very well.
That's lovely. I really like that.
We certainly enjoy wine. We're not wine experts.
Of course you're an expert. If you find a wine you enjoy, you're an expert.
  We'll take those, please.
  Great. I'm sure you'll enjoy those.
Thank you very much.
  Bye.
  Bye bye.
As they drink in the New Zealand scenery,
it's a chance to think back over everything that's been missing.
Having spent so many years not being able to get out and do stuff,
or planning to do stuff that ends up being cancelled.
Being able to come here, being well and being able to do things,
is life changing, isn't it?
It's going to make a big difference to be able to think, "What shall we do?"
Make a plan and actually be able to do it and not be concerned
about whether or not you're going to be well enough.
That's going to be a huge release for you.
And that's good for both of us.
After some tough times, this looks to be just what the doctor ordered.
So, it's on to the next stop.
I've been a keen New Zealand wine fan for quite a few years.
To be able to come here and try the wines
in the places where they're grown is amazing. It's fantastic!
It adds to the experience of having a glass of wine, definitely!
  It's nice to come and...
  ..try before you buy.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
So, you've got a nice bit of diesel.
I didn't want to say that and be offensive. Actually, it smells like fuel.
  But... It's a good job it doesn't taste like it.
  Very true, very true.
A day sampling the lifestyle Down Under seems to have gone down very well.
But has it done enough to win their vote?
Based on the lifestyle options we could have in New Zealand or the UK,
we are going to vote for...
  New Zealand.
  New Zealand.
We live in a fantastic part of the UK
but, you know, we want a lifestyle change.
We want something different. This could be it.
I voted for New Zealand in the lifestyle options today
because our whole move is about new experiences.
What we've done today has been completely new experiences for us.
So, New Zealand.
It's more good news for Rob and David's worries seem like they're a thing of the past.
But, amongst all the positivity, there's also a reminder
that this decision might not be as simple as it looks.
Everything just seems to be falling into place.
All these pieces of a puzzle are fitting together too neatly at the moment.
It does make you think, is there something that will turn up
that actually breaks that puzzle apart for us?
It's easy to make a decision when everything's falling in your lap.
But it's when you consider and you think about the people that we would be moving away from,
that's what is going to make it a difficult decision.
It makes me emotional thinking about friends and family because they're so important.
They've always been there through all my illness. Everyone's been known to support me.
When you go through that, it makes you realise how important people are.
And, um,
how much people do love you.
Tasting the New Zealand experience was another big success.
But it also reminded Rob and David of what they stand to lose by moving.
Having been through illness together, saying goodbye to loved ones
who have given them so much support, could be a painful experience.
Ah, here we go!
Hi, Rob and David.
  Hi, Rob and Dave.
  My, Robs and Dave.
David is um, he's kind hearted.
A wicked sense of humour. He's so funny.
Dave is like, he's got the same sort of sense of humour as me.
We often say, when they made us, they broke the mould.
  We're just stupid together.
  Two of a kind.
Rob is... How can I put it?
He's always there when you need him.
He's reliable. He's...
As all brothers, he can be a pain at times.
  Cheeky
  That's why we love him so much.
Robert is kind and he's a very good teacher.
  Sounds really Brummie.
  And he gets on very well with other people.
And so does Dave.
I think it's the fact they're just such a big part of our lives.
When they go, it would be like losing an arm or a leg.
Them not being there, not seeing them, I think it's just...
  It's going to be strange not having them around and...
  Yeah.
Robert and I especially have been through an awful lot together.
And Dave's had to put up with me in their lives as well.
So he's been very good about it.
Life is short. And these opportunities
don't come by very often. So, go for it. Give it a go.
You're a fantastic brother and you're a fantastic brother in law, Rob.
I agree with you there.
  All the best to both of you.
  See you soon.
  See you soon. Bye.
I hope you have had a wonderful week
and I will miss you
really, really loads.
Anyway, I must say bye for now. Love you loads.
And, er, good luck.
Er, yeah. I'm not going to be able to say anything actually.
That is the deal breaker. It's just so hard.
When they're such an important part of your life, to suddenly...
It is like cutting off an arm or your leg.
Mmm. It almost feels like,
actually, you know, everybody's been there for us.
Rob's had this operation. He's getting well.
We've had this opportunity and it's just like
we're turning our back on everyone, it feels a bit like that.
  That's really harsh.
  It's a bit like a slap in the face to everyone.
  It is, isn't it?
You know that everybody wants the best for us and they want us to do what we want to do.
It doesn't make it any easier.
If it wasn't for that, I'd be on the plane tomorrow.
The impact of seeing messages from home has taken Rob and David by surprise.
If the emotional cost is too high a price to pay,
it could mean giving up the dream for ever.
Time for them to make their final decision.
The waters have muddied again somewhat through hearing
what our friends and family had to say.
Trying to weigh up this decision is a really hard thing to do.
I feel completely torn at the moment
between what my heart's telling me and what my head's telling me.
I've turned myself inside out, to be honest.
It's been an emotional rollercoaster
of up and down, up and down, yes, fantastic. Whoo, maybe not, maybe not. Agh, yeah!
So, it's kind of like, um,
trying to pin a jelly down, you know with this.
It's a big decision. It's not one that anybody could make lightly.
At this point in time, I really don't know
how David and I are going to make this momentous decision.
Um, and I think,
at some point, we've got to come down on the side of hearts or heads.
I know people are supposed to go with their hearts not their head.
After looking certain,
Rob and David's decision rests on a knife edge.
So, will they choose a new life or is the pull of home simply too strong?
It's time for the final vote.
We've had an amazing week in New Zealand.
We've seen some wonderful properties, met some fantastic people,
and our final vote is going to be for...
  New Zealand.
  New Zealand.
What made you say New Zealand then?
I think if we don't take this opportunity now, we never will.
  We will regret it in years to come.
  Yeah.
It's an opportunity. If we don't do it, same as you,
if we don't do it, then we could well regret it for the rest of our lives.
I didn't actually know what I was going to do until I started twirling.
Neither did I.
It was like, no, it has to be that.
Yeah, OK.
I had no idea what Rob was going to vote for.
I just thought to myself, well, actually,
if I say the UK now, then I'm shutting the door on something
that I haven't really given full consideration and thought to.
Now that we've made the decision,
I definitely think that our path is set   that it's the right decision.
I feel like a weight has now been lifted off my shoulders
that I've been carrying around for the last couple of days.
It would be a new chapter for both of us.
In fact, it would be a new book. Not just a chapter.
So, it's really quite exciting.
Despite the emotional cost,
Rob and David agree that New Zealand is where their future lies.
It's been an incredible experience for Rob and David.
They both know full well what they'd be giving up
for life in New Zealand.
But, the promise of a new start has convinced them
that the dream could be real after all.
