The guard is your protection, big lord.
And here is your peace and safety...
Rachel Thomas was a formidable actress.
Her spirited performances made her a star for over 60 years.
So, you think fit to insult a faithful chapel worker and three time semi finalist?
But I believe the last time you were a semi finalist in the Nationals was quite a while ago.
Well!
Oh, that I should live to see this day!
On screen she played the iconic Welsh mother.
A part she not only played, but lived.
As a mother, wife and daughter, she embodied our most precious ideals.
Rachel came into the world as Rachel Roberts,
born in a quiet corner of the Swansea Valley in 1905.
Her father was a coalminer and the Roberts family lived near the little village Alltwen.
The life of the village revolved around its one chapel, Capel yr Alltwen.
I had two miles to go to the chapel.
And often times in the winter we lived in a very lonely spot.
It was very, very lonely
and we had to walk through two huge fields.
Huge meadows...and when we came to the third meadow, you could see the chapel in the distance.
It was always lit up and I never felt afraid.
As soon as I came in sight of the chapel, it was like a lantern lit up.
It gave me courage.
Rachel would walk to chapel three times every Sunday with her four brothers and sisters.
On weekdays she attended literary readings and choir practice.
It was here that she learned first to sing and then to recite.
Her father, David, could see that she had a gift for recitation.
He would walk miles with her, so that she could compete
in Eisteddfodi in neighbouring villages.
He gave me that, you know, extra...
I don't know what it was. Confidence, I think.
He used to catch hold of my hand, you know, so tightly and I felt, you know, the world was with me.
But father and daughter arrived at one Eisteddfod only to discover they'd come unprepared.
Each child trying the recitation, which was called The Forget Me Not,
had a flower in his or her hand.
And I didn't have one. Of course, I was late arriving there and then
my father got out quickly and he said,
"I'll get you a flower," he said.
And he went out through the crowd.
I was ready to go on and I could see my father weaving through the crowd
and he put in my hand the most beautiful prize pansy I've ever seen in my life.
There was nothing for it now. I went on and I had this pansy in my hand and
I was reciting about The Forget Me Not.
Of course, at the end of the competition, the adjudicator was Chris and he was very droll.
Chris, you know. "Of course", he said,
"The best reciter in this competition
"isn't getting the first prize and you don't know why, don't you?" he said.
"No, this is a girl that recited about The Forget Me Not with a pansy in her hand."
And, of course, I had second prize.
At the age of 11, Rachel won a scholarship to the local grammar school.
To pass the scholarship was a very big thing in those days.
Of course it meant having everything free, you see.
The train fare and the schooling and the books and all.
Did it mean you had a free uniform?
Oh, no. We had to pay for that!
At Ystalyfera County School, Rachel met a woman who sparked in her a passion for drama.
We had a wonderful English mistress, Miss Dennis,
and she seemed to me as if she'd read all the world's books.
She interested me in the plays of Shakespeare and she allowed us to read characters from these plays,
especially Lady Macbeth and Gertrude,
and I was allowed to read all these characters out.
Not perform, but just read them in class.
That made me very interested in English literature.
Rachel was inspired to become a teacher herself.
At the age of 21, she left her home and family to pursue this ambition.
She travelled east to find work in the mining town of Gilfach Goch.
The children in Gilfach Goch, they all spoke English.
That was very strange. I came from a Welsh speaking village.
I remember singing these little folk tunes nearly every morning.
I thought, "Oh, what a wonderful chance to teach the English children to sing Welsh folk tunes."
I think one teacher complained, you know, after being with me, they...
she couldn't teach the children at all, they were too tired.
Two years into Rachel's career as a teacher,
a double tragedy struck the Roberts family.
I was called back from Gilfach Goch
and when I saw my mother, I couldn't get over it.
She'd aged so much and gone down so quickly and I thought,
"There's something wrong here."
Apart from that, for the first time, my mother kissed me.
She wasn't one for showing her feelings. It was all inside.
But she kissed me and I thought, "Oh, this isn't right."
I didn't... I didn't feel it was right at all.
And then,
on the following Wednesday, she died.
Mary Roberts had spent her final years nursing her husband, David.
After decades of working in the dusty atmosphere of the coal mines,
he was suffering from the lung disease, neumoconiosis.
Rachel now sacrificed her promising career to care for her father.
I was granted leave of absence from school for six months.
Without pay, of course.
I looked after my father. I was with him night and day.
He eventually succumbed to the illness.
Rachel buried her mother and father within six months of each other.
But at this dark hour in her life, there was one ray of sunshine.
I first met Hywel, my future husband, at the summer school in Llanwrtyd.
People in the village, they were all very intrigued
because they didn't know who he was and they're making up stories about him, you know?
Some thought was a minister and he was all sorts of things.
Because he didn't come from the village itself.
He came from Breconshire.
That was a long way off, you see.
Rachel Roberts and Hywel J Thomas were married in Capel yr Alltwen in 1931.
Rachel was 26.
Downstairs was full.
And they were all elderly women, you know.
About my mother's age.
I'll never forget, when I came out to the vestry after the ceremony,
they all stood up and said, "Priodas Dda"   happy marriage.
And...well, I don't know, it filled me with tears,
you know, to think... Because my mother wasn't there, you see.
And they were coming to wish me luck.
Hywel and Rachel moved to Rwihbina.
on the outskirts of Cardiff, where Hywel taught in a local school.
Rachel felt lost in the suburban English speaking neighbourhood, far from her native roots.
To make matters worse, as a married woman, she was no longer allowed to teach.
She sought comfort in the familiar world of the chapel.
Every Sunday, Rachel travelled four miles
to the nearest Welsh speaking chapel at Minny Street in Cathays.
In 1933, when the BBC broadcast a service from Minny Street,
Rachel was invited to read the lesson.
That reading would change her life.
Hearing a woman's voice coming over the air in a service, that had never happened before.
So, people wrote in.
The BBC was inundated with letters inquiring about the owner of that fine dramatic voice.
Sensing a good thing, radio producer Sam Jones
invited Rachel to attend an audition at the BBC's studios in Cardiff.
He said, I want you to make up... a dialogue between two women.
One living at the top end of the row and the other one at the bottom end of the row.
I said, I haven't got a script. "You don't want a script.
"Go on, make it up. Go on.
"Fire away, I'm listening!"
I don't know where this voice was coming from. It wasn't where I was, anyway.
Coming over the air.
I started and I thought, "Well, if I'm living at the top end and
"the other woman at the bottom
"then I've got to shout", and I was shouting at the top of my voice.
Until I heard laughter coming over the air.
Sam Jones said, "Typical Alltwen", he said.
I thought, "Oh!" I was a bit affronted in, "Typical Alltwen",
because Sam Jones came from Clydach.
Only four miles from Alltwen, but it was...
The nearer you got to Swansea,
the more it was sort of...English fied they became.
Sam was impressed by Rachel's performance, and hired her.
She began making regular trips to record at the BBC studios at 39 Park Place.
She acted in radio dramas, and performed live readings.
At the age of 28, she was suddenly an actress.
Well, Gwen, we're away at last.
I can't help it, Tom.
I'm not happy in my mind about going and leaving Gwynneth as she is.
Don't be silly. You know there's nothing to worry about for at least two months.
And we're only away for a week!
You don't understand. I'm afraid things are not going right with her.
Don't forget, it's her first baby.
By the fuss you were making, anyone would think it is your first baby.
For goodness sake, woman, think of yourself for a change and try to enjoy yourself.
And then there's our David, too, sitting those exams and working so hard. And me not there.
Ah, Darrow, I'm in for a lively week's holiday by the sound of it.
Live radio could be a demanding medium,
as Rachel discovered during a broadcast of Children's Hour on 20th January, 1936.
I was reading a story.
Before we started, the producer came in. I think it was Erwin Evans,
and he said, "Now I want to warn you,
"the King, King George V, is gravely ill, and anything can happen.
"But, in the meantime, we'll carry on as per usual."
And we carried on, of course.
And I was in the studio. I wasn't at the main mic. I had a microphone to myself on a little table.
With my back to the studio door.
And, in the middle of my reading,
I heard a kerfuffle at the door.
I couldn't look around, otherwise I'd miss my place in the script.
So I carried on. And within seconds, a hand clamped down on my shoulder and turned my face away from the mic.
I was terrified. I thought, "What have I done? What have I done?"
And I looked up, and Erwin Evans was there, and he went...
And he mouthed the words, "The King is dead."
And soon after, we heard solemn music coming over the air.
But there was cause for celebration the following year,
when, at the age of 32, Rachel gave birth to a daughter, Delyth.
Unusually for a woman of the 1930s,
Rachel now juggled her promising career
with the demands of motherhood.
Though this was not always met with approval.
I remember meeting my relatives.
And one of them specially, a great aunt of mine, came on and she...
not speaking to me but speaking to Delyth, a little baby then, and asking her,
"Do you know your mummy, bach?"
And that hurt me more than anything else.
It went right to my heart, and I thought, "What have I done?
"I've gone and left my child."
But despite the disapproval of others, Rachel continued to work hard as an actress and a mother.
At the age of 35, her career took off in a new direction.
When her radio producer asked her how she'd like to be in a film, she thought he was pulling her leg.
But after a successful screen test, Rachel was cast as a miner's wife in the film Proud Valley.
She was to appear opposite a giant of the silver screen.
American actor and singer Paul Robeson.
The film told the story of a black coal miner with a talent for singing,
who receives a warm welcome in the valleys of South Wales.
I was very nervous, because I'd never been inside a film studio.
The first time I saw him coming through the doors, he was a huge man.
Much bigger than I ever thought he was.
And he was introduced to me.
And he said, "Miss Thomas?" We shook hands and he said, "You're Welsh, aren't you?" I said yes.
"I love singing to Welsh audiences", he said, "they're so responsive."
And after that, it was plain sailing.
He was quite easy to work with.
Mum, he'll stay here with us.
With us? What are you talking about? Where with us? I'd like to know?
We'll find room for him somewhere.
Somewhere? Dick Parry, have you forgot that we have five children of our own sleeping in this house?
  No.
  Well, well, I don't know what to make of you.
Come now, Mam, think what it will mean to the choir.
You and your old choir. Why don't you bring all the members of your choir to sleep here?
  Make a barracks of my house and have done with it.
  Come now.
  Don't think you can get over me this time with your old nonsense.
  Come now, lovely.
  Let me go!
  Listen...
  Too much I have listened to you.
Paul Robeson said of Rachel, "She is one of the finest actresses I have seen in my life."
The critics hailed the birth of a new star.
The Observer wrote, "What a pleasure it is to look at a real woman's face on the screen. A good face.
"With a heart shining through it."
This was the first of many film roles for Rachel.
In the years that followed, she established herself as a great character actress.
I've always had an old fashioned face.
To me, anyway. When I was a child, I never looked in the mirror.
I thought my face was so old fashioned.
You've got a gentle, soft face and a soft voice.
  And yet you've played some pretty awful women, haven't you?
  Oh, yes.
Well, I like doing that sometimes.
It takes me out of myself,
and it's a new character, performing these different hard characters.
I like it, it's a challenge.
Soprano, Miss Milana Lewis Rhys.
The contralto will be sung by, Mrs Marged Davies.
  I beg your pardon, Mr Llewellyn?
  Yes, Mrs Lloyd?
Perhaps I was mistaken?
But I thought you said contralto would be sung by Mrs Marged Davies?
  Those were my words.
  Thank you.
Thank you, indeed.
I thought I'd misunderstood.
  Clifford!
  Yes, Mum?
  We are going home.
  Now, Mrs Lloyd, there's no suggestion whatever...
Mr Geraint Llewellyn, I'm not suggesting there's any suggestion being made.
I'm not suggesting, either, that there's any reason why
Mrs Marged Davies would not sing the contralto this year.
Indeed, I'm sure the good woman has quite a nice voice.
Quite a nice voice.
Rachel may have been a star of the screen,
but she still preferred to watch her films at the local picture house,
rather than at a London premiere.
She remained grounded
in the traditional Welsh values of her childhood.
For Rachel, family always came first.
I had a wonderful husband.
He helped me all the way.
He was like my father, you know?
Giving me a help when I needed it most.
Because, I think every performer needs somebody to give him or her a push on in life.
And Hywel was one of those people.
Hywel was behind me every time.
Egging me on.
And that meant a lot to me.
But, in 1953, Hywel suffered a debilitating stroke.
He was ill, then,
for ten and a half years, before he died.
It was Rachel who now supported Hywel.
For a decade, she became his carer and the family's sole breadwinner.
She compromised her own career in order to look after her husband.
The last year of his life, I brought the bed down to the front room.
And...when he died, and of course he died, I wasn't expecting...
of course, the doctor said he would die, but I wasn't expecting, I wasn't looking forward to it at all.
But he went very quietly one night.
33 years of marriage came to an end on the 3rd August, 1964.
At the age of 59, with Delyth away in college, Rachel was suddenly alone.
I had to carry on and and earn my own living and keep the place going.
Because Delyth was in college at the time,
and it meant looking after her as well.
So, I didn't realise at the time that it was hard,
but it must have been hard, you know?
Thinking back on it.
From the 1960s onwards,
television provided a new platform for Rachel's talents.
What's all this, then?
Now, don't worry. It's not about you, love.
I've nothing on my conscience, so talk away.
Well, I'd like Ray to visit me, but he reckons he never will.
America, is it? That will be very nice, of course.
But it's too late for that now, my boy.
  Why?
  Use your brains, boy.
You're getting married, you're getting a wife and you're getting a new house.
  You can't go gallivanting off across to America.
  Eight hours by plane.
And a penny bun costs tuppence when you're married.
He's going to settle down.
Mam, but he's only 22. I mean, with any luck, he'll make 70.
That's 48 years to go, Mam.
And he'll spend them here. Anyway, you'll be coming back. You always do.
  So why should he go out there?
  Only because it's there.
  I suppose it is.
I never looked at it that way.
Don't you start. "Because it's there", indeed. A lot of nonsense.
Here is here and here is where you belong. Ask anyone.
Rachel had always played strong, down to earth women and as she grew older, these roles grew with her.
She continued to work steadily throughout her 60s.
In 1973, she appeared opposite Oscar winning actor Hugh Griffith,
playing a widow who decides to remarry.
  What do you think, then?
  That colour always suited you.
It'll come out well in the photographs.
Pity you hadn't got a nicer day for it.
It's nicer than last time.
It was snowing.
I was only a little girl then.
We walked to the chapel in those days.
Frozen, I was.
Crackling down the street in my wedding dress.
Somebody said, "We couldn't afford a red carpet, so we had a white one instead".
I remember Uncle Dodger, how handsome he was. Like a little lion.
We had the reception at Auntie Gwen's
because they were the only ones with a front room big enough.
It started again as we were walking.
We stopped for a minute in the lobby, just the two of us.
There were all these snowflakes stuck in his hair.
I always remember looking at him,
the snowflakes melting.
The following year, Rachel was cast in a role
that would come to define her
for a new generation of viewers in the long running soap opera Pobol Y Cwm.
I remember when I first had the script of Pobol Y Cwm,
I had no idea how to portray Bella.
And it took me five days
and I remember on the fifth day, I went upstairs and I opened a box and
there was a hat which I'd worn many years ago in a film.
But I put it on my head
and I looked in the mirror and shouted, "Bella!"
In 1978, an official letter arrived at Rachel's house in Rhiwbina.
And I saw the announcement inside about the OBE and I couldn't believe it.
I had to read it over and over again.
And on top of that, you see,
there was nobody in the house for me to share the joy, you see.
My husband had died by this time.
And then Delyth, my only daughter was living away in Essex, not far from Southend.
And I couldn't tell her over the phone.
And I was supposed to keep the secret to myself.
And I did for six weeks.
And people say that women can't keep a secret!
That same year, she gave a spirited performance alongside Philip Madoc
in the period drama Hawkmoor.
Come on. Move along now.
Church, all of you, to pray for the salvation of your souls.
And for the grace to obey and respect authority over you.
  Would you defy the command of God?
  No, I would not.
  Then get into church.
  That's your command.
It is the command of the Holy Roman Church through me as its servant.
Then the Church is badly served.
I'll have you carried in.
I'll be carried into church once only.
Feet first.
And there won't be any paupery near me on that day.
You blaspheming, evil woman.
Three years later, Rachel was back and causing trouble in another costume drama.
Ah, my dear. This is Mr George.
The one who wants to start a Liberal Club in Criccieth.
  Mrs Owen.
  I know quite well who he is, Richard, and what he wants.
I've been making inquiries about him.
Well, he's quite a promising young man, my dear.
He's a penniless fortune hunter without two pennies to rub together.
of Williams the ironmonger, who belongs to the same set.
Some kind of Baptists.
And she takes in summer lodgers.
And if you imagine he's been coming here to see you,
I'm afraid you've been sadly mistaken.
What do you mean, my dear?
Surely not Maggie.
They've been meeting secretly. I've seen letters from him.
They were hidden.
Under the lining paper at the bottom of a handkerchief drawer and you see from those papers
that she kindly presented him with one of our prize asters.
But that he couldn't be sure of the colour of it because
it was dark at the time.
The winner of the first BAFTA Cymru special award is Miss Rachel Thomas.
Thank you all for your wonderful reception.
And thank you for the wonderful tribute that has been paid to me tonight.
Four years later, at the age of 89, Rachel made her final appearance
on screen in the play, The Whistling Boy.
She could now look back on a career that had spanned an astounding 62 years.
Well, I had wonderful moments in my life. Not all good, of course, like everybody else.
Good in patches, I suppose.
But, on the whole, I've had a lovely time because I've met so many different people.
It gives me very great satisfaction to know that I've done something in my life and something I've enjoyed.
That's the main thing, isn't it?
Rachel Thomas died on 8 February, 1995,
days before her 90th birthday.
Her funeral service was heard at Minny Street Chapel, where her career had begun,
and where she'd remained a faithful member of the congregation until her death.
