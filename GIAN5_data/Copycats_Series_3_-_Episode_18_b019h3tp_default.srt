'Welcome to Copycats with your hosts Sam and Mark.
'And today's Copycats are
'Amelia's team from Surrey.
'And Luke's team from Edinburgh.'
Hello and welcome to Copycats, the gameshow where copying is good.
Today's teams are playing for the new and improved,
but still bingy boingy Copycats trophy.
Oooh.
That is one good looking trophy
and how do you think we're looking? Wooo.
Thanks very much. I could get used to all this pampering.
What do you mean?
Today, I've been for a body wrap, pedicure, manicure,
facial, massage, spray tan, eyelash extensions and a wax.
What have you had done?
I washed behind my ears and changed my pants.
Really?
Maybe I didn't change my pants but I did wash behind my ears.
  Shall we meet the teams?
  Yeah.
  Luke's team, good?
  Yeah.
  You up for it? You up for it, today?
  Yeah.
  I can see it in your eyes. There's a focus here. OK.
Luke, want to introduce the rest of your team?
These are my two school friends, Thomas and Niall.
  My teacher Stephen, my dad Keith and my mum Mandy.
  Fantastic.
You're all looking really good, up for the challenge.
Give it up for Luke's team.
Over here, we've got Amelia's team. You all right? Yeah.
Amelia, introduce the gang.
These are my two school friends, Gabby and Tilly.
And this is my mum Erika, my dad Kevin and Angus is Tilly's dad.
It's lovely to have you here.
I'm going to ask you a serious question. Are you going to win?
Yes! Oh. That's all I need to know.
Everybody, please give a massive round of applause to Amelia's team.
Looks like our teams are ready to start copying.
The teams will take it in turns
to copy pictures, actions and displays of musical genius.
To get as many points as possible,
each team will take turns to face the Copycats challenge.
And a chance to win that awesome Copycats trophy.
We tossed a coin and Luke's team are going to be playing first.
Let's play Copycats.
Luke's team, I hope you've been brushing up on
your artistic skills cos it's time to play Quick On The Draw.
I've got three cards.
You're going to pick one of these cards,
then you have ten seconds to draw what is on that card
for the player next to you and then so on down the line.
There's a maximum of 50 points to be won in this round.
You will lose ten of those points for every incorrect answer.
  Copycats, you ready?
  Yes!
  You look ready. I like it.
In that case, let's close the doors.
Mandy, I've got three cards here. Green, orange or purple.
  Which one would you like?
  Green.
Have a look at that.
  Yeah?
  Yes.
  Got that in your head?
  Yes.
  Best of luck.
Ready, steady, draw. Open the door.
Get as much detail in there as possible.
OK, Thomas, your turn, mate.
OK, Stephen, your turn.
Good copying, there.
OK, Niall.
Go on, Keith.
OK, stop drawing.
For a maximum of 50 points, what has Keith drawn?
Is it a tent?
That's probably what he's drawn, but it's not right.
Open the door.
  Keith, what's Niall drawn, there?
  Was it a rabbit?
It's not what I've got on the card. Open the door.
For 30 points, Niall?
Is it a...?
Hare?
It is not a hare. Open the door.
For 20 points, Stephen? This is where it got weird.
For 20 points, come on, what's Thomas drawn, there?
  Was it a wigwam?
  No. Let's open the door. Come on.
You've got this, that's good drawing.
  Was that a pair of scissors?
  Yeah!
Well done, Thomas.
A great drawing! You got off the mark with ten points.
Well, done Luke's team.
Two cards left, pick one.
  I'll try purple.
  Take a look.
  Reckon you can draw that?
  I'm pretty sure.
You've got ten seconds, best of luck. Ready, steady, draw.
Very good, very good.
Not bad copying. Tilly, your turn.
OK, Erika, your turn.
Kevin, go for it.
OK. Stop drawing.
Tough one, this.
For 50 points, what's the answer?
  Is it a hat?
  It does look like a hat.
That's not the answer we're looking for.
We're playing for 40 points. Kevin, what do you think?
I think it's a cap.
It's not, it's not. OK, which means we're playing for 30 points. Erika?
  Is it a spotlight?
  Interesting. It's not a spotlight.
  Which means we're playing for 20 points. Tilly?
  Is it a dummy?
  Yeah!
Well done, you get yourselves 20 points.
So, after Quick On The Draw, are Luke's team, a cut above the rest?
Are Amelia's team having teething problems? Let's look at the scores.
Mr D, what could they be?
'After Quick On The Draw, Amelia's team have 20 points.
'And Luke's team have ten points.'
Still all to play for. Still all to play for.
The next round will test our teams' skill, nerve and determination.
The game just got serious because this is the Copycats challenge.
My team will be going first.
So you don't get a sneaky peak, we're going to send you off.
Don't worry, you will be coming back. Say bye to Amelia's team. Bye.
Luke, as team captain, you now need to select three people
to face the awesome Copycats challenge.
Before you do, let's find out what's in store.
  Mr D, tell us will you?
  'The Drop.
'A coloured rod will be displayed on the screen.
'Players must remove the corresponding rod
'while trying to avoid the balls dropping.
'Ten points are awarded for every rod pulled out.
'But ten points will be deducted for any ball that falls.'
In, three, two, one, pull.
'Getting us started, it's Luke the team captain.
'Looking for one of the red rods. Here we go.
'Oh, that black one's coming out.
'I don't know what's happening there. Yeah, put it back.
'It's the red one you're after.
'Yeah, it doesn't matter that it's fallen in. That's it.
'Well extracted.
'Next, it's a yellow one for Stephen. Come on, Stephen.
'Luke's teacher.
'He does that gently. Very good.
'Don't worry about those rods falling in. That's not a problem.
'It's balls falling in you need to avoid.
'Next, it's Niall, extracts one on the black rods.
'It's back to Luke.
'Yes, one half way out, there, that was easy. Next, it's Stephen.
'Looking for a red one. Another easy one.
'This gets tricky, as time goes on.
'Red one for Niall, well done. Back to Luke.
'Looking for a black one.
'Come on. That's a nice, easy one. Or is it?
'No, try that one. He used the advice.
'Now, was that good advice? Was that good advice?
'Oh, a couple have gone. Not bad, not bad. Next it's Stephen.
'Looking for a yellow one, Stephen.
'Choose the right one, whatever you do. Oh, gently, gently.
'Well, that worked, didn't it?
'Oh, no, it didn't though, look! Five have dropped.
'Next. Oh, a black one.
'Well done, Niall.
'Red one, Luke.'
We're going to give you that last one. Nice work.
We'll add those challenge points to your score after the Music Round.
Amelia's team need to face the Copycats challenge.
The points from the challenge could make all the difference.
A dream ticket to the Ball Room is at stake.
Give it up for Luke's team.
Welcome back to the game, Amelia's team. Let's play Mime Time.
I've got three cards. You're going to pick one.
You then have ten seconds to mime what is on that card
to the person next to you. And so on down the line.
50 points are up for grabs,
but you will lose ten points for every incorrect answer.
Do you understand? Awesome. Let's close the doors.
I've got three cards. Which one would you like?
  I'd like the green one.
  The green one, take a look.
She likes it,
  she likes it. Reckon you can do that?
  Yeah.
You've got ten seconds. Best of luck. Ready, steady, mime.
Very good. Tilly.
OK, Erika.
Kevin, your turn.
OK, Angus.
Time's up.
OK, guys, for a maximum of 50 points. What's the answer we're looking for?
Being an evil mastermind?
That's the best answer we've ever had on Copycats.
It's not being an evil mastermind.
I wish that is what we had on the card.
Which means we're playing for 40 points. Open the door.
  What do you reckon the answer is?
  Playing the bagpipes.
It's not playing the bagpipes. Good guess, though.
We're playing for 30 points. Kevin.
Snake charmer?
These are all cracking guesses. It's not.
  We're playing for 20 points. Erika?
  Playing the harp.
It's not. Which means we're playing for the minimum of ten points.
  Is it playing the accordion?
  Yeah!
Well done. You get yourselves ten points.
I've got two cards left, purple or orange.
  Which one would you like?
  Orange, please.
Have a look at that.
  Yeah?
  Yeah.
  The best of luck, Keith. Ready, steady, mime. Open the door.
OK, Luke.
Good.
OK, Mandy, your turn.
OK, Niall.
OK, Stephen.
OK, stop miming.
For the maximum, 50 points, Thomas, what's the answer?
  Is it Robin Hood?
  We cannot give you that, I'm afraid.
Let's open the door. For 40 points, Stephen?
  Was it shooting a bow and arrow?
  Yeah!
You get yourselves 40 points.
Congratulations. Very good.
So, after Mime Time, is it going accordion to plan for Amelia's team?
And will Luke's team be saying, "Arrow" to the Ball Room?
Now, those all important scores. Mr D, what could they be?
'Well, Mark, after Mime Time, Amelia's team have 30 points.
'And Luke's team have 50 points.'
  Pretty close, pretty close.
  Indeed.
It's time to get serious cos Amelia's team are
about to face the Copycats challenge.
It's your chance to attempt to add some crucial points
to your overall score.
Are you ready? Yes.
Luke's team, it's time for you to leave.
  Say goodbye to Luke's team, for the time being.
  Bye.
  Bye.
  They look sad to be leaving.
  I'm sad to see them go.
I bet you are.
Amelia, you now need to select three people
to face the Copycats challenge.
Before you do, let's see what's in store for you.
Mr D, over to thee.
'The Drop.
'As before, a coloured rod will be displayed on the screen.
'Players must remove the corresponding rod,
'while trying to avoid the balls dropping.
'Ten points are awarded for every rod pulled out.
'But ten points will be deducted for any ball that falls.'
The best of luck. In three, two, one, pull.
It's a red one.
'Here we go then, Kevin getting us started.
'Amelia's dad,
'who removes one of the red ones straight away.
'A yellow rod for Tilly. Which one are you going to choose?
'Is that one going to work?
'Yeah, looks like it. Well done.
'Next, team captain, Amelia.
'She's looking round to choose one of the black rods to remove.
'It comes out straight away, excellent.
'Back to Kevin, now.
'A yellow one, yeah, well done.
'OK, Tilly, red. Skipping around the studio, there.
'Come on, yes, well done, don't worry about that one.
'Next, red for Amelia, in the polka dots.
'Gently does it, that's good.
'Kevin's next, looking for one of the black rods to remove.
'Which one's he going to choose?
'Hmm, that one. Yeah, that's good. That is good. Tilly.
'It is yellow, that's right, that one.
'You going to try that one? Let's see. Yes, that works.
'Amelia, next.
'Black. Now, this is getting tricky.
'As time goes on, this is what happens.
'Come on, you've got 15 seconds left. You've got to choose wisely.
'So much encouragement. Just one ball has fallen. Not bad at all.
'OK, Kevin. It's red. Time's running out. Make a start, it'll count.'
Well done, guys.
Only one more round to play before we add those challenge points
to your total and reveal which team are going to be
playing for the trophy.
Give it up for Amelia's team.
  Welcome back, Luke's team.
  This is the Music Round.
You have to pick a tune and then re create
that tune for the person next to you on the world famous Copycats kazoo.
Could everybody, except Niall, please put their headphones on.
So you do not hear which song is being selected.
Looks like our Copycats our ready. Let's close the doors.
OK, Niall, I've got three cards, which one would you like, mate?
  Orange, please.
  Have a look at that.
You know that?
We are going to play it into the studio.
Let's have a listen to this one.
I think he's got it.
Best of luck. Ready, steady, play. Open the door.
OK, Mandy.
Very good.
OK, Luke.
OK, Keith.
Go on, Thomas.
Stop playing.
For the maximum 50 points, Stephen, what's the answer?
  Was it Tragedy?
  It is not Tragedy. OK, so open the door.
Thomas, for 40 points, what was Keith playing, there?
  Was it Fly Me To The Moon?
  By Adele?
  Yeah.
That is the wrong answer. Open the door.
For 30 points, what was Luke playing?
  Was it Poker Face?
  It wasn't Poker Face. Let's open the door.
  For 20 points, Luke?
  Was it Wiggle Like A Fool?
Wiggle Like A Fool, I've not heard of that song,
but it is not that.
Open the door. For ten points, Mandy, you know this.
I'm really sorry, I don't know the name of it.
  Go on.
  Waterloo, ABBA.
  No. Niall did a brilliant, brilliant job.
  What is it? Tell us.
  Teenage Dream by Katy Perry.
Teenage Dream, Katy Perry. Let's have a listen.
Ah. You got the melody down, really, really well.
You don't get any points. But give them a round of applause.
Erika, we've got two cards left. Which one would you like?
  The green, please.
  Take a look.
Do you know that?
We are going to play it into the studio.
  So, get the melody in your head.
  Right.
  Let's hear it.
Best of luck. You've got ten seconds. Ready, steady, play.
Very good.
Good luck, Angus.
OK, Gabby.
Tilly.
Time's up. Stop playing.
OK, for a maximum of 50 points, what's the answer we're looking for?
  ABBA, Waterloo.
  We love ABBA here on Copycats, don't we?
It's not ABBA, Waterloo. We're playing for 40 points. Tilly?
  Don't Stop Me Now by Queen.
  Great tune. It's not, though.
Which means we're playing for 30 points. Gabby?
  Is it Celebration?
  Celebration, it's not.
Which means we're playing for 20 points.
Angus, you didn't have a lot to go on.
  I think Gold Digger, Kanye West.
  Oh, tune. It's not.
We're playing for ten points. I've got to say, Erika did a cracking job
and you were nodding, as though you knew it.
I I knew what it was but I couldn't remember what Erika was playing,
so I just played something random.
Wow.
Do you want to take a wild guess?
You never know, you might get it right.
  A song by ABBA?
  It's not a song by ABBA.
  Do you want to tell everybody?
  It was Your Song, Ellie Goulding.
Let's have a listen.
That means you don't get any points in this round.
But give them a round of applause.
'After three rounds, Amelia's team have 30 points.
'And Luke's team have 50 points.'
So, even scoring in the pass it on games.
We still have to reveal the scores from the Copycats challenge.
Which team destroyed The Drop?
And which team are going to the Ball Room?
The wait is over.
I can reveal that one team got ten points in the challenge.
I can also reveal, one team got 80 points.
Ooooh.
Which means, the team going through to the Copycats Ball Room
and playing for the trophy is...
..Amelia's team!
  Wow.
  Only dogs can hear that scream.
Which means, we've got to say goodbye to Luke's team.
  You had a good day?
  Yeah.
Give it up for Luke's team.
Amelia's team, you've made it this far and now,
it's time to compete for the fabulous, money can't buy,
lovely, shiny, springy thing that is this, the Copycats trophy.
It's proper shiny! Here is the Ball Room.
Amelia, who have you chosen to play the Ball Room?
  I've chosen me, Gabby and Angus.
  Excellent.
Let's take a look at what you have to do to win this loveliness.
  Magic.
  Hide it.
'The Ball Room.
'Players must collect 25 green balls and deposit them
'in the scoring cylinder before the time runs out.
'Any rogue coloured balls collected will be deducted from the total.
'Good luck.'
Three, two, one. Blast the balls!
'In the Ball Room are Gabby, Amelia's school friend,
'Angus, Tilly's dad, and Amelia, the team captain herself.
'25 green balls are needed to win the bingy boingy Copycats trophy.
'How we doing so far? Quickly as you can.
'In goes one and another. This is very good.
'Half a dozen in there already. How many has it got? Fantastic!
'Well done, Angus. Good work.
'Come on. That's what they're saying outside the ballroom.
'Inside, a lot of activity. Look at this.
'Will it be enough, though? Come on. 12 seconds left, guys.
'25, you need.
'No rogue coloured balls, so far.
'Quickly, put those balls into the scoring cylinder.'
Angus! At one point you had four balls in one hand.
  That's physically impossible.
  OK, the balls have been counted.
And the result has been checked.
You needed 25 green balls to win the trophy.
I can reveal that you collected...
Oh.
So, you're not going to get your hands on the Copycats trophy.
But we are going to give you some Copycats t shirts. All right?
Yeah.
Have you enjoyed yourselves? Yeah.
Give it up for Amelia's team.
  You're not going to believe this.
  What?
  It's only end of show, isn't it?
  Oh. Put that back in the safe.
  We'll see you next time on Copycats.
  Bye.
  Bye.
