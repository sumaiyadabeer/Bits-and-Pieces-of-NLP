Tonight, the week the Government and the opposition stepped up the
fight to win over the middle  classes. Call them the alarm clock
generation, or the squeezed middle, their fortunes or misfortunes, may
dictate the next election. The cost of living will make or break the
Conservative Party and the coalition at the next election. It
is the number one thing that concerns people. Privately, I'm
being told that this week's reshuffle is all about the cost of
living. Putting those faces to the front that can sell the
Government's message, that it understands hardship. Labour gave
us a big idea too. It wasn't redistribution. We will be talking
to Stan Greenburg and Stefan Shakespeare, about who has the
answers. Also tonight, when you have six for mobile phone credits,
the kids that are being groomed, deused and abused. Dominic West
played the serial killer, Fred West, in BAFTA winning performance, it
motivated him to learn more about child safety. What happened when
you met up? I went for a drive. What did he say? Nothing, he gave
me a phone. We speak to Dominic and guests here in the studio, and ask
whose responsibility those kids are?
Good evening. The cabinet juggling of this week has been called in
inner circles, "the cost of living reshuffle", a clear sign, perhaps
the Government recognises it is the very issue that will win or lose
the next election. All week politicians on both sides of the
house, both sides of the Atlantic, have been struggling to articulate
solutions to what many believe will be next month's conference
battleground. The struggling middle classes facing rising food
and fuel prices, here is our political he had dor. An average
India summer. Things look so much better in the sun. Even the best
September glow will struggle to improve the look of a wage that
doesn't grow, and hasn't for a few years now. Acute economic problems
squeezing households might pass like a plane across the sun. But
there are broader shadows cast. In an average estate, in an average
part of town, this is issue number one. Bread and butter issues
persuaded the Government, a reshuffle, and may not be relevant
to this Government. What Ed Miliband and David Cameron were
doing is readying themselves for the debate. The cost of living is
the number one issue for the British public. This week David
Cameron kicked things off with a cost of living reshuffle.
New jobs were announced by the company,Am stkpon, today, the Prime
Minister was there are willing them on, but he and his advisers know
that even for those with work, the problem is balancing the books.
David Cameron's Government believes its policies are helping the
squeeze on people's lives, having frozen council tax, and letting
people keep more of their salary. But focus groups, carried out by
Downing Street, show people believe local councils to be responsible
for the first, and no one knows about the second. Now Keneth Clarke
is the highest profile of a number of ministers, tasked it with better
getting that message out there. The minister for Ronnie Scott's, may
have suddenly been made the minister for the cost of living.
This Government has long frozen council tax, and is also increasing
the personal tax allowance. These are good policies that help with
the cost of living problem. Now they have put the people in place
to help promote those policies, they know they need to do more.
Ideas doing the rounds include action on childcare, or a further
delay to the fuel duty increase. George Osborne's speech to
conference this autumn, is expected to be the moment it would be
unveiled. His speeches are often rabbit out of the hat moments. This
rabbit has to be pretty big to feed a lot of families. One of those
waiting on Osborne's rabbit is the foodbank supporter, like this
minister. They offer food to struggling families. The cost of
living issue will make or break the Conservative Party and the
coalition at the next election. It is the number one thing that
concerns people, the petrol bills, the food bills, how much tax they
are paying. Wherever I go I see people struggling to keep their
head above water. The husband, I meet couples and the husband is
working all day, he comes in and his wife goes out to work all night.
These are many families across Harlow, people getting up at 4,
5.00am, working every hour they can in order to keep the family
finances in order. The Government are wise to that I gend da, they
are trying to do    agenda, they are trying to do things about it.
It requires tough choices, if they were to overhaul environmental
policy we could get energy bills down, it requires tough choices and
those with subsidise in industry wouldn't like that.
Subsidies in industry wouldn't like. That we have to look at getting the
most out of public services to ease resources and the squeeze on
people's pockets. If the Government wants policies to ease the squeeze
right now, there are those in all parties looking at how long term
they can improve people's ability to make more money in the first
place. Forget the growth they arey, and the post bureaucratic age, Pete
pre distribution. Pre business tribbuegs is about saying we cannot
allow ourselves to be    pre  distribution, means we can't allow
ourselves to be about taxes and benefit and low wages. Our aim must
be to transform our economy so it is a much higher school and higher
wage economy. Government sources today are saying they are already
pre distributing, they are rewarding schools and enabling
skills so people can get better jobs in the future. But pre 
distribution, in the form Ed Miliband intends, ined crudest form,
could involve the nobbling of companies. The two approaches that
they are take to go relieve living standards pressures, one is a tax
cut, aimed at working people, broadly, in the form of increased
personal allowances, and deregulation, it is an interesting
twist on deregulation. It is deregulation on parts of public
services, which people have to pay for, like childcare, to try to make
those things cheaper. There is a lot of scepticism about whether
that will work, it is a traditional, centre right approach, being
applied to an area of public policy. Over in America, ahead of their
election, a new book deals with how all politicians have failed to help
middle earners deal with the squeeze. Though America's middle
making for a muddled model for the British middle, there are lessons.
There is no other way of putting t the two Titans of the American
political scene, we have failed. Their British opposite numbers air
strikes cross all three parties, are trying to ensure there is
another way of putting it. The author of that new book, it is
Middle Class Stupid, is Democrat pollster, Stan Greenburg. He joins
us now. And Stefan Shakespeare is co owner of the website
ConservativeHome. If we can start with you and that quote, that the
reason you wrote the book is because they have failed and that
is it. You recognise the middle  class is vital? It is vital to
America identity. It is vital to the middle of the country. When we
talk about milledle, we are talking about the    middle, we are talking
about the middle classes, people who have an aspiration for
education for their kids and rising prosperity. Hard work is a central
value. If you look at the Democratic Convention this week,
hard work, work just ran through the entire thread. Work is supposed
to pay. We wrote the book, because work wasn't paying. People were
expressing great frustration. We wanted politics to work for the
middle class. It wasn't happening. That's why we wrote the book.
you look across the Atlantic here, what has to change for us not to
fail on that issue? I'm not sure I should provide the prescription. Ed
Miliband talked about the squeezed middle for a long time. What we
tried to argue in if this book, is this problem wasn't produced by the
financial crisis. People understand this preceded it. There has been
long term lack of jobs, lack of income growth. Our polls even in
even in the last week or so, still have dae Kleining income. And the
way it is    have declining income. And the way it is expressed is
prices in the grocery stores. Price is the filter for a long period of
jobs that don't have increased pay. It is lack of jobs and lack of jobs
that pay. People understand and say long term problem, and they are
looking for, I think, bold solutions that address those kinds
of problems. It is interesting, we heard it referred to as the cost of
living reshuffle, if you like. The Government recognising that it is
those prices, it is train fares, rising fuel, food, all the rest of
it, whether they win or lose the next election, is that what this
change in the last week was all about? Yes, I think it was. Until
recently the whole Conservative presentational case was put through
David Cameron. It was David Cameron, the prime ministerial one, versus
Ed Miliband, the non prime ministerial one. Now it doesn't
seem enough. People do feel the squeeze, they are getting it from
both sides. It is aptly called the squeezed middle. They feel upwards
and downwards it has all gone wrong, and it is not enough. Is your
suggestion that David Cameron cannot be the person that sells
that to the electorate himself, it is too awkward? There is
recognition of that in Tory circles. He has done well on the fronts he's
good at. But we are in new territory and we need an additional
cast of characters to get that method across. The argument in the
states has been tax ku cuts versus tax breaks, we have this clunky
phrase from Ed Miliband called "pre distribution", I think it was
imported from America. Is that something you can implement? Is it
a vote winner? We will know soon whether it is a vote winner in
terms of how the election goes. One thing that is clear, is President
Obama, in the last three or four months, has come to identify the
middle class, the squeezed middle, as the central issue. If you looked
at the convention hall this week. Signs saying "middle class first",
were plastered all over the convention hall. He has made it
essential. What is clear, if you look at his speech, this is
something that we have said in the book, this is a long term problem.
Therefore, it needs, people get that there needs to be policies
that create jobs with rising incomes. That is, I think, is what
Ed was hinting at when he said we have to get the right kind of jobs
and strategies, to have the right kind of jobs that can produce
rising incomes. It is an interesting idea. Pre distribution,
meaning, essentially, that the wages have to be something worth
getting. Would you be brave enough, would a Government be brave enough
to say, yes, employers have to pay more. We are going to raise the
minimum wage? One thing I think is a problem with this is the name.
That is very important, people will not understand this phrase.
Miliband came up with a good phrase with the squeezed middle, "pre 
distribution" will confuse people rather than entighten them. What
the authors have done really well in their book, is put together a
really serious and comprehensive policy to deal. I don't think it
would work here, it may work in America. It is such a simple idea,
it is a wage that pays you enough money. That you are not going back
for tax credits and looking for the right kind of loopholes, it is a
wage that pays you enough money to live on? Everyone would want that
to happen and nobody would argue against it. How you get there is
the argument. That is a serious economic argument that isn't
contained in the current debate. Stan Greenburg. In the book we
introduce, relevant to the, but bold in comparison to what people
are talking about here. We talk about how to get healthcare costs
under control, how to have an industrial manufacturing policy,
using energy that promotes American jobs. I can't judge whether those
are right, but I can't believe there isn't a set of policies that
can be focused on, how do you have a growing number of jobs that have
associated with them enough income to have a rising standard of living,
so you don't have to address the kind of price struggle that people
face now. If you are David Cameron, if you are the Conservatives, going
into conference next month, knowing this is the issue on everyone's
mind, what would you take. We were talking about the fat rabbit coming
out of the hat. What has that got to be? Osborne is good at fat
rabbits, but he has also had a clear message about austerity and
it will pay off. But it hasn't, so far, it has been very, very
difficult to find any sense of growth or anything positive? There
is no rabbit that will replace real growth. Only if that happens can
the Conservatives possibly win the next election. Thank you both very
much indeed. One girl describes having sex in
exchange for mobile phone credits, another describes the abuser, he
believed, on line, was a fellow teenager. Child grooming is not a
new problem. But these tales are a timely reminder it still goes on.
25 years after the serial killer Fred West was convicted of raping
and murdering 1 girls. He was characterised in a BAFTA winning
performance by Dominic West, who since has become deeply involved in
the issue. He made a film for us about vulnerable teens. We will
speak to him in the studio about his experiences in a few moments.
First their stories. When I made a programme recently on
television about the Fred West case, one of the thing that alarmed me
most is a man could prey on vulnerable young people for nearly
25 years and go undetected. The sad fact was a lot of his victims were
not missed by anybody, and not cared for by anybody, that is why
it went undetected. He made me feel down all the time. I always felt
down all the time. I always felt upset. And so how long you had been
on the Internet talking before you met up? Only like a month. And then
what happened when you met up? went for a drive. And what did he
say? Nothing. He just gave me a phone. And then when did he start
wanting to have sex with you? two weeks later. Were you happy you
didn't want to? I didn't want to. Did you say you didn't want to?
What did he say? He said I gave you a phone, so I get something in
return. I kept saying no. He was always like, if you don't come out
and see me, then send me a picture of your fanny and all this. I was
like, no I don't want to he will keep going on and on, I just do it
to shut him up. What does he do with that picture? I don't know.
have a young daughter on Facebook all the time, how dangerous is it?
How can you tell? I don't know. don't know. What made you want to
meet up with the guy? I don't know. Were you curious, did he sound
interesting and exciting? Well, I just used to do it because for love,
to get love out of it. Because I didn't get enough at home. My mum's
an alcoholic, so she always drinks, so I don't really...Did She know
what was going on? No. Does she know now? No. How many children do
you deal with here? At any one time we could be working with up to
about 50, on a direct one to one basis. Right, so what happens in
here? This is our client room. If we are bringing young people into
the service, if we are doing a special on relationship, we would
look at how you feel in certain relationships. You are looking at
things like they are feeling nervous, and they feel weird and
scared, reckless, excited. And sometimes kids can, you know, not
be able to identify if they have positive people around them.
problem with child sexual exploitation, with things like
internet and that, is the problem getting worse or are we just more
aware of it? Yes, as opposed in the community, if they are going to
target a young person to groom them, when you are on line you can target
any amount of young people, and out of say 50, I guarantee you will get
quite a few that are going to fall into that process of being groomed.
What amazed me is so many kids, it seems to me, go missing, and
unaccounted for, and nobody knows about them, those are the most
vulnerable people to exploitation? I think that the process of, with
perpetrator, is becoming more sophisticated, with awareness of
the law, awareness of vunbgts, and children may be just mis  
vunerabilities, and children may be missing for a few hours and taken
back home. There may not be an indication that they are being
sexually exploited, because the perpetrators are becoming wise.
in ten of the children Barnados treat are boys, they call them the
hidden problem, and say the aftereffects of sexual exploitation
on a boy's identity can be devastating. The person just wanted
to know everything about me. What did you think about the police, did
you think they were there to help or were you frightened of them?
was frightened, they were pressurising me. Why? They wanted
to know every single bit of detail. And they were putting me on the
spot, as I said they wanted to know everything. I couldn't remember
everything. They were, presumably, because they wanted to talk to the
guy who was corresponding? They said they were on my side, but it
didn't feel like it. How did it feel? Nervous, I thought I was the
one who was going to get into trouble. Did you think it was your
fault, in a way? Yeah. Do you still think that? Sometimes, but not as
much. What happens sometimes that making you think that? Em, because
I think to myself that I shouldn't have responded or replied to him. I
should have known better. Do you think you were duped, or you were,
it wasn't what you thought it was? Yeah. Or maybe it was and you were
excited by it, or interested in it? Yeah.
The most shocking thing for me today was hearing from a young
woman prepared to sleep with men she didn't want to, purely for
mobile phone credit. It is clear the children on the end of this
abuse, struggle to identify it for what it is. For them gifts must be
paid for, and friends are people whose demands can't be turned down.
Since they are not able to, some how Government and wider society
has to do more to identify it for them. You saw Facebook mentioned in
that piece, and "tagged", they say they have many features to protect
users from misuse, and they have many platforms to keep young people
safe. Claire Perry and Dominic West are here, leading a campaign to put
filtering devices. And a representative from the charity,
Safe and Sound. If we can pick up where you just left out. That idea
when you are speaking to these kids, and it is quite hard to work out
whether they saw themselves as victims, or when you said gifts
must some how be paid for, it is a very confused relationship for them,
sometimes? I think that was what was one of the more depressing
things, was they seemed totally unaware that they are being
exploited and they are victims, and that, I suppose, certainly Harriet,
the girl I spoke to, she was from, she had a bad home background, and
so had no idea, I suppose, about what affection and love was about.
I assume that is one of the things she was looking for, and had really,
or she said she didn't realise that, when she was in a room full of ten
men that was exploitive. It is unusual for an actor to go this far
along a theme or a role, presumably, outside a role. What was it that
drew you in here? The Fred West case, I obviously got very involved
in. The most, the appalling aspect of it was it was essentially a case
of child sexual exploitation, and it was also a case that a lot of
his victims were children, and they were also people who nobody klted
for. That their parents    not accounted for, that their parents
didn't know them or care homes couldn't keep tabs on them. I
wanted to see who was dealing with that and sorting it out. I spoke to
Barnardos who have a campaign that deals with missing children and
sexual exploitation, the two are very much linked. What was your
experience when you saw how the problem is being dealt with, or
tackled, or approached, did you feel reassured? Not really, no. It
seems incredibly difficult. I mean, the Millennium Dome, the centre I
went to was a very quiet place. It was I thought a lot about a charity
I came across in Baltimore and we were doing The Wire, and we were
raising funds for a woman who had set up an afterschool club for kids
who were vulnerable and on the streets and couldn't go home. I
thought it would be a centre like that. Obviously this centre, the
Barnados centre was much more specialised, because it was about
specifically abused kids. One looks around for people to blame, the
Government or parents, and the truth is that's everyone's
responsibility, really. Your nodding. Do you recognise it is
some how isn't taken on board by smaller community, much more grass
roots? Yes. Sorry. I think my experience in Baltimore, and I
think Natalie will talk about it, conviction that is have happened
recently seem to have come from a community based thing rather than a
national based thing. What do you make that have? I think it's
make that have? I think it's everybody's responsibility. The
Government could do a national awareness raising campaign. It
needs to be recognised as everyone's responsibility. It is
parents, it is communities, it is people who work in shopping centres,
people who work in hotels, it is police, it is local authorities.
Everybody needs to work together to address this. At the end of the day
it is the perpetrators to blame, nobody else. As we heard there,
they are getting more sophisticated, they have a whole range of
technology, and all the rest of it to deal with? Dominic has made the
point, having played Fred West. This is a problem that has existed
for years. What technology has done is amplify the problem and make it
much, much easier to contact children and young people. We had a
cross party parliamentary inquiry into the issue, specifically of on 
line child protection. We had various charities that educate in
this area, and parents are frequently incredibly complacent.
Right now, the way you are supposed to protect your family from adult
contact on the Internet is to download filters delivered by your
service providers. Great technology, and only four out of ten families
use it for various reasons. That is the stable, structured families.
What your investigation found, is how, as children become more and
more vulnerable, and out there in society, in children's homes,
perhaps with more dysfuntional families, they become even more
vulnerable, and the technology makes it even harder to shield them.
As a dad and parent do you feel able to get more involved. Would
you step into your daughter's virtual life? No. I tried, but
she's in charge of setting up filters in our family. So, she
comes to you and says you might have to put that on for me?
didn't know about the filters, to be honest if I talk about it.
think we need an opt in, because you need a feed that is clean, if
you want the material, no one here is anti porn, there is no Mary
white house campaigning, you opt in to get it. The mobile phone
question we were talking about, now with a smartphone you are
accessible all the time. I have three children, I was asking myself
why do I not feel confident in looking at their phone message, we
pay for their phones. We have given our children an unprecedented
private space. Or who they friend on Facebook. Would it occur to you
to read your children's texts? would be like reading her diary.
there were a bunch of guys hanging around, we give them a private
bubble. If you picked up a landline call, in the old days, you would
have a sense of whether somebody sounded a bit dodgy. Completely.
You might not know that these children have got mobile phones.
What we find is that the perpetrators will buy them a new
mobile phone, and they will have two. They will be very, very
secretive about the one that the perpetrator has bought. As a parent
you might not know about it. It is about educating children around
this issue, it is about raising their awareness in primary schools
W appropriate messages around staying safe, safe choices. You are
always going to be one step behind f you try to legislation on
technology, you will always be a step behind whatever they have
thought of next? We are not calling for legislation, the idea of the
Government legislating the Internet, Governments can be clunky in this
area. What I want, and it gets back to the issue of lots of people
being involved, specifically the Internet service providers, six
provide 95% of access in the home in Britain, they make about �3.5
billion in internet access revenue, it is the only form of media where
there is no control. In television we have watershed, films we have
ratings, why should the Internet be different. If Natalie is right, it
is not a question of whether the kids can get on to the right search
on the Internet, it is whether, it might not even have parents around,
they might not have parents that notice whether they are missing for
a couple of hours. It is quite possible with teenagers? It is also
the case that, sorry, lots of kids in stable families will have
laptops in their bedrooms, the parents don't necessarily know what
is happening either. It is about education for me, it is about
educating children so they are aware, they know why not to put
certain things on line, and certain photos or personal information on 
line. How do you educate, though, a girl who has come from, probably a
pretty abusive or addictive family. Who might not have had any kind of
stable relationship in her life, she falls in love with the first
guy that gives her a mobile phone? That is very difficult, but it is
everybody's responsibility, it needs to happen in schools, in
children's homes. So we do awareness raising sessions in
schools and children's homes and youth clubs and places like that,
so we try to hit as many young people as we can with the stay safe
message. Those who have been groomed effectively, need support
to get out of abusive relationships. Dominic, going back to some of
these kids, did you get the sense that they had learned just another
level of not to trust, or do you think? What was really shocking is
they, particularly Harriet, she felt, I'm addicted to the Internet
and my mobile phone, it doesn't matter with me, she felt if she
didn't have a phone, the guy who was abusing her, all he had to say
was, I'll take your sim card away, and if she didn't have a mobile
phone or access to social network, she did not exist. And she was a
non person. That's something that my generation never had to deal
with. We met our friend, do still, but it is like you have no identity
now. And when my daughter went to school, aged pre legal Facebook age,
her peers came up to me and said why are you not letting her on
Facebook, she as the only one here and missing out on all the social
interaction, you are mad, what is the matter with you. It is that
sense of children living their lives in an on line world, that we
all a little hard. That is why the Internet has become the place where
they socialise, get information, I would like more protection and
filtering of some of the adult content. We have run out of time.
Thank you very much indeed. That's all tonight, there will be plenty
more next week, until then, have a Hello there, it is going to remain
very warm for some of us this weekend, a chilly start in the
south west with fog too. That will soon clear, patchy fog in parts of
north the sunshine does arrive eventually. In the north of England
a while to brighten up. A lovely day through the Midlands, highest
temperature in East Anglia and the south east, could hit 27 Celsius in
the light winds. Southerly Brize, the highest temperatures will be   
southerly breeze, and highest temperatures 25. A lot of sunshine
in Wales. Warming up nicely. Lovely day. Across Northern Ireland,
conditions will be improving, after a cloudy start, more sunshine
developing, like we did today, 20 degrees is likely. Across Scotland
it is the North West that could be cloudy, elsewhere some sunshine and
it will be a pleasantly warm when it was out. In Paris, 30 degrees on
Sunday, in the sunshine, a little bit more cloud in Berlin, warming
up as weekend goes on. Fine, stuny hot weather continues in Rome and
Athens, a few showers inland Spain. Wetter conditions arriving in
