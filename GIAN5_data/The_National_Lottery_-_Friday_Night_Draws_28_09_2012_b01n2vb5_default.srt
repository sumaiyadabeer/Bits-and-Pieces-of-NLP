the weekend off to a bang, it is Matt Johnson. Welcome to the show.
I want you to brace yourselves because this weekend there is not
one, but two chances for you to win big and become a multi millionaire.
We start with a huge EuroMillions jackpot worth �80 million. That is
just moments away. Then tomorrow night, it is the first ever Lotto
quadruple rollover draw. What makes it more exciting is the jackpot has
to be won tomorrow night. More about that later. Right now, we are
ready to start making some Friday Fleet Milne. On Wednesday, over
176,000 tickets won a prize. Are we good to go? We are. Good luck,
Thunderball. You can play on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
Let's start the second machine. There is one final number to be
drawn in this game. It is Thunderball itself. It promises
bring cash prizes for all who match it. If you have matched the first
five, the cash prize you are looking at is worth �500,000. The
best of luck to you all. Good luck from me, too. I'm nice like that!
That is 12. Those Thunderball that is enormous, the jackpot, it
Tell us again how much the jackpot is? It is estimated at �80 million.
Imagine winning that. What could you buy? How about this? It is the
world's most expensive dress covered in diamonds and costing
�3.5 million. For the guys, perhaps a diamond suit, which you could
pick up for �600,000. With the money left over, you would still be
richer than Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow put together. And
probably look as good if not better. Before you start sizing up, let's
find out what those winning numbers are. To start winning tonight, you
need to match with two main numbers. The first ball this evening is 20.
OK. The next ball out this evening is 26. And the third ball out
tonight   good luck, everybody   is 30. And the next ball out tonight
is 33. And the fifth and final main ball is 23. UK Millionaire Raffle
is next. First here is Charles with those Lucky Stars. �80 million is
at stake. The first Lucky Star is 6. And the second Lucky Star is 9.
Those numbers again in ascending guaranteed �1 million is what is on
offer next with the UK Millionaire Raffle.
Right, it is time to reveal tonight's winning raffle number.
You need an exact match to win. Get those tickets where you can see
them. Tonight's winning number is   also got �1 million if you have!
Well done. I have been told that early indications suggest the
Spain   but there is one UK ticket that has matched with five main
numbers and one Lucky Star. OJ is here tomorrow night. The first ever
Lotto quadruple rollover draw will take place. It's never happened
before in the history of the National Lottery. To say it is
exciting is an understatement. What makes it better is that �19.6
million must be won tomorrow. If nobody matches the six main numbers
drawn, it goes to the next prize tier until there is a winner, or
winners. You can watch the Tuesday EuroMillions and the UK Millionaire
