Good afternoon and welcome to the programme. As usual we'll bring you
coverage of First Minister's Questions this afternoon before
asking what our Welsh Affairs Editor Vaughan Roderick thinks
about it. But it's not just Vaughan's thoughts I want to hear,
I would love to hear form you. You can share your thoughts with us via
Twitter or you can send us an e  mail. Well, let's take a look now
at questions to the First Minister Carwyn Jones from a little earlier
this afternoon. Good afternoon. The first item this afternoon his First
Minister's Questions. I would like to ask the First Minister when he
last met with the First Minister of Scotland. I last met him on 13th
January in Dublin. During that meeting, did the First Minister of
Wales have an opportunity to insure him that he will not interfere in
internal issues in Scotland, and has the First Minister of Wales had
an opportunity to direct the Prime Minister of the UK have to behave?
Can you tell us more about the convention he launched yesterday
and may I say that I am very supportive of this a step. Thank
you for that. I have made my opinion public that the future of
Scotland is something for the people of Scotland. Regarding the
convention, it is very important that we consider the position of
the UK at present, regarding developments of the past few years
so that we get more clarity about the various powers that this
Assembly has, the Northern Ireland Assembly has, and UK government as
well as Scotland. What the First Minister agree that when voters in
Scotland come to put their crosses in the Scottish independence vote,
that they consider that they are not just breaking away from England,
but they are breaking away from Wales and Northern Ireland as well
to fellow Celtic nations. And doesn't he think they should
consider that when they come to vote? I very much hope the people
of Scotland had to remain part of the UK. They are very important
part of the UK and Scotland adds balance to the UK. He UK will be
very much worse off without Scotland. I know occasionally we do
disagree on a few things, but on the issue of the future of the UK,
I know that you share my view that the United Kingdom has a steered
Wales and all the constituent parts of the UK in good stead for 300
years and hopefully will continue in the future. Following on from
the question asked, would you once again staked your belief in the
importance to Wales or Scotland in the United Kingdom remain together,
and would also agree that it was very important the Prime Minister
did give an indication that they should be an early referendum
because in the meantime, businesses are suffering from the uncertainty
that has been created by the Scottish Nationalist Party. I'm
sure you would not like to see his security. What happens in Scotland
as a matter for the people of Scotland. I'm not convinced it is a
wise intervention on the part of the Prime Minister with regard to
Scottish affairs, but that said, I would very much regret seeing
Scotland leaving the UK. I very much believe in the unity of the UK
and certainly it would be great last was in Wales of Scotland were
to leave the UK. Can I remind people that it is one question and
sure preambles. Paul Davies. What is the Welsh government doing to
improve public transport accessibility across Wales? We are
delivering accessibility improvements to public transport
across Wales. This includes the new train services to Fishguard, the
forthcoming reopening of a station and the current major improvements
to Swansea High Street station. of the plans that has been very
successful but meant than breath of Wales is the town riders King which
has this    which has increased accessibility for many people.
Understand of funding of the scheme is to come to an end. Many
constituents have contacted me and a very concerned that the scheme   
scheme is to come to a close because many feel that it is a
lifeline to them under these circumstances. Is the government
reconsidering his decision? And if not, what will replace this
valuable service? Unfortunately, that funding is no longer available
for that scheme from the government. But from what they understand,
there are ongoing talks with the local authority regarding the
future of the schemes. At Prime Minister's Questions last week, we
have the Conservative government is axing the Labour initiative to
contain the prices of transport. I wondered if you could say what can
be done to ensure that the price of train fares is as important as the
accessibility. It is crucial that people feel they are able to travel
on public transport paying a reasonable fare. The great danger
is that if where fares are allowed to rise in an unregulated way, that
they will rise to an extent that people feel they cannot access the
railways. It is absolutely crucial that there is proper regulation
implies across the hall of the UK. Your government here in Wales has
just kept the ground to bus companies by a quarter    cut the
grant. This is higher than in England. This cut has been made
with just 10 weeks notice, although the contracts were in place with
the county council, why is this cut so significantly higher in Wales
and why was there so little warning given to bus companies who will
suffer as a result and will have to cut services? It continues to be
higher than it is in England, looking at the per litre of fuel,
we should look at the budget we have had from London, we had to
consider the best way to cut some services. Unfortunately, this is an
area where we had to reduce the subsidy available, but again,
emphasise that the funding is higher than if you look at the Poly
to fuel in England. They are a number of areas in North Wales
where public transport is not available and where the public,
particularly the elderly, are dependent on commuter transport.
When will you government be in a position to give some assurance on
funding for next year in this area? As I said, we are in a situation
where it is not possible to ensure that the same amount of money is
available that we would like in the future. But of course we want to
look at all kinds of ways of ensuring all kinds of transport in
all parts of Wales. Disabled people are more likely than non disabled
people to be the victim of crime. Public transport can be a
particular hot spot for that. So much so, that many disabled people
feel unable to access public transport that exists. Volley
provide us with them    an update on what you are planning to do so
that disabled people can feel safe in public places? The issue of hate
crime against disabled people have been raised before. It is one we
take very seriously and we deplore it. The fact that people should
seek to target those who were in a position of particular fund ability,
I know we have been working with the authorities in the past to make
sure hate crime is dealt with.    vulnerability. First Minister, in
your programme for government, you will about encouraging greater
levels of private sector investment and employment. Could you explain
what you would measure as a success as the end of a programme for
government as to that increase in private sector investment? More
businesses, more jobs and increase in gross domestic household income.
Does our aspirations we would all agree with. One of the deficits in
the Welsh economy is the inability to attract high end value drops to
Wales, headquartered jobs, whether they be UK headquarters can be
European operations all well the operations. Recent evidence taken
in an article by the chief executive of Admiral highlighted
that if they were considering locating in the current climate,
they must probably would not lead to Wales to locate their
headquarters. What actions of the government doing to undertake full
engagement with the private sector so those high end jobs and high end
companies do actually locate herein Wales? A central business district
of Cardiff has been daggers    designated as an and present and
that will be crucial in attracting financial services such as Admiral
in the future to a capital city. We will also continue with the contact
that we make in other countries, I have been to China, I will go to
the US and India over the next few months to ensure that investment
opportunities for Wales are maximised from this countries as
well. Nobody could disagree with those sentiments that you have put
over this afternoon, a duck the issue is, Lego    regrettably, the
record is not good in the first 10 years of the Assembly government in
attracting this type of companies. I fully endorse the efforts behind
Cardiff Business District, but we need to hear from you what
different measures your government will be doing to engage with those
high value customers are. already have the anger companies
that have been designated. They are the largest employers and Wales. We
look very closely    we work very closely with them to attract
further investment into Wales and the future. May I also welcome the
debate but you have opened on the constitution. The problem with
opening such a debate is you have to then say where you stand on that.
Can you tell us what constitutional changes he would favour for Wales?
Firstly, regarding Part 1 of the commission to consider issues such
as taxation, landfill, taxation for airports, look at issues such as
stamp duty, in order to reassure that we have a way of developing
taxes and Wales bearing in mind that they fall within their
responsibilities that we have presently. What you're saying is
that you're happy with the constitutional settlement as it
currently exists but that you would favour some tinkering with some
minor issues of taxation, that could raise hundreds of thousands
rather than income tax or corporation tax. Isn't it true to
say that the reason that the current debate is ongoing is there
is full clarity in what Scotland is requesting? Alex Salmond is asking
for independence for Scotland. The problem is there is no clarity in
terms of what you are requesting were seeking. The reality is, in
Reading, and I have read very carefully what you have said if you
press conference, you're they did the question on where exactly you
see the constitutional future of Wales. Indeed, what is your
ambition for Wales? Although you have refused to answer that
question, can you tell the Assembly were you truly stand? Are I am not
in favour of independence. Regarding my opinion, the silt
Commission, we have that and we are in favour of borrowing powers and
we are in favour of looking at issues such as energy. Regarding
allowing energy products in Wales. That is what the whole Assembly is
in favour of. By one that Assembly to have powers that are relevant,
but I don't want to go over the cliff regarding favour of
What I have to genu First Minister, is the only time you have fire in
your belly is when you say you are talking about independence, in
every other issue you sound week, if I may say so, so there is a lack
of leadership. If we are to have the constitutional debate, in terms
of these constitutional changes, but that will mean is that all of
the parties have to set out there stall more clearly. You, and if I
may say so, you have mentioned relatively minor issues in terms of
constitutional change, but there is significant difference between what
you're suggesting and independence, and in Scotland as a possibility
that there may be a question of a different type of responsibility.
There can you tell us exactly where you stand on the continuum, if we
are going to have a considered discussion on this issue, we need
to know where the First Minister stands. And it is perfectly clear
what my opinion is. Everything is said on the changing of the ballot
system. That has to happen before are anything else, or else we are
locked into a basis of raising taxes from a weak position. I am
perfectly happy to have this debate to with their leader of the party
because he will be going out in May and saying that his party is in
favour of independence. I would be happy to debate with them. First
Minister, the most recent set of educational results showed that a
Welsh students are falling behind in mathematics and science. Are the
workshops approved and funded by the education ministers to teach to
the test the answer to the shortcomings in the education
system? It is part of the picture, but we want to see an improvement.
I understand why you want to save your government from another
embarrassing set of poor education results, but it is not just about
this, in your Cabinet report, the education minister said this is
only one part of the jigsaw, but it is reflective of other evidence.
Examination results are rising but are not in pace with England. This
is consistent on the GCSE and A  levels. Kenny detail of supporters
were now offering to the schools that recently placed in banned five
of the system? This is a matter for the local authority to identify
what support is needed, but the Education Minister is absolutely
right in saying that parents and teachers have an idea of what needs
to be done in the schools and the banding provides that evidence.
is extraordinary that you have absolved the Government of any
responsibility in ensuring that the schools get the support they need.
I have no problem with giving parents the information on how the
school is doing, but I want to see that matched with action to improve
the school. One headmaster of a band five school has said to me
that if this is the target support, then where is it? What is it? We
have had no follow up from Annie one since the publication of these
figures. You were happy to coach and pay for schools to pass the
assessments to save government blushers. When will you target
assistance at the schools and law bans to improve the school's?
have resources that go beyond the UK government. We are transparent
about this. We're happy to publish performance levels and also to
publish funding levels on an annual basis, something the UK government
has refused to do it in terms of England. It means we can no longer
compare funding per head in England and Wales because the UK government
of which our party is a part, have refused to publish comparison
figures. I very much regret that. We move back to questions on the
paper, Simon Thomas. Will the First Minister make a statement on buffer
zones for open cost developments? would refer you to minerals,
technical advice note to. Thank you for that response and with
reference to the technical advice, he will know that that refers to
500 metres in terms of a buffer zone for open development. Why has
planning permission been given to extend the same talent opencast
site which will bring it within that 500 metre buffer zone close to
people's homes and to playgrounds, one of the playgrounds of one of
the brand new schools in the 21st century schools programme. What
will you do and what are you tell constituents that are concerned
that the rules could not be followed in this case? This is
something for the local planning authority. I cannot make any
comment on any individual cases. But the policy is still there, this
buffer zone policy still exists in this technical advice note. First
Minister, it is important that the buffer zone is a duty by local
authorities and enforced as much as possible, but we Dewar Greek it is
important to insurer bad businesses that operate restore the land so it
goes back to the way that it was.     but we need to agree it is
important to ensure that businesses. It is the responsibilities of those
that work on open cast mines to restore the land once the
operations have come to an end. That is an obligation that
everybody in the wider world would support. In terms of how we will
enforce this, this has to do with the ad said of the agreement on
part of the local planning a authority.    the outset. They
would retain the responsibility for restoring the conditions when they
had been imposed at the first part of the planning application. With
the increasing focus on energy generating fuel, pretty clearly
open cast as we are fortunate of having some resources and Wales, is
it time to look at enforcement policy on the fact that in England
section 106 is there. There is no buffer zone in England, buffer
zones can go anywhere. That is not the right approach. You raise this
question of section one of six which is worth considering a, had
their ways of standing out? There is a limitation because the
community infrastructure level composers in a way that we do not
welcome.    imposes. It would be better if the infrastructure levy
was at a default or if it was phrased in a less prescriptive way
than it is at the moment. previous Environment Minister
promised to review a buffer zones when the new law was tested. After
that happened, the current environment minister said he did
not believe that this was necessary because the local development plan
and the guidance provided the balance. However, many of us went
to a meeting with lawyers who want to look at areas and they wanted to
deconstruct the statutory instrument, as they put it, so that
clients can to press ahead in those areas without going straight into
restoration. What are your views on this instance continuing looking
better answers to your colleagues on this? And the attempts to
deconstruct the planning guidance as you put it would resist strongly.
We take a very dim view of attempts that are made to get around
planning permission and planning guidance in order to facilitate
opencast mining. The guidance is there, it is clear and the buffer
zone is clear. What is the First Minister doing to support small
businesses in South Wales Central? We have clear steps to support
business and government. One of the visible steps was to establish the
sector panels ostensibly to give business a voice in government.
Despite the fact that businesses are described as micro businesses,
only 20 % of the people on the sector panels are from SMEs not at
all micro businesses. On behalf of the 40,000 micro businesses in
South Wales Central, what will you do to redress this balance and give
the small businesses the voice they deserve in this Government?
micro business task and Finnish group launched its findings last
Wednesday and they are considering the details of their
recommendations. They will be taken forward in due course. I know that
many small businesses in my constituency will welcome the
recommendations of the recent task on micro business groups set up by
the minister. When I spoke to SMEs, I have often been told that they
feel that the feedback mechanisms in place are not as good as they
should be elected businesses know what they can do differently the
next time, if unsuccessful in bidding for a public sector
contracts. Can you give some assurances that strong feedback
mechanisms may be central to the Government's response to the
report's recommendations regarding support and advise? Absolutely.
Feedback on services we provide is important and the response to the
micro Service report will have suitable feedback mechanisms in
place. I welcome that the report is with the business minister from the
task group that he set up, but time and time again, small business has
come and speak to me about the delay in getting information, and
that flow of information from the 12 governments but allows them to
procure or participate in the procurement of a contract. When
would the minister be in a position to bring the information for word
over the proposals they are looking to streamline the process? This is
why the micro business task group has set up. There is an
implementation plan which would be drawn up and publish shortly. We
will continue to meet on a quarterly basis to monitor the
implementation of the recommendations as well. There is a
possibility some say a probability that the Welsh economy is in
recession right now, but because it out of date statistics we receive,
there is no way of us really knowing. The UK economy as a whole
is teetering just above negative growth at the moment, there is a
strong suspicion that the south  east of England is skewing the
overall figures. Firstly, will you insist upon the collection and
publication of up to date quarterly statistics, like those produced in
Scotland, so that we can have the full picture here of the Welsh
economy and so that policies can be tailored to, for example, measures
that could help small businesses in my region, small businesses are
struggling in every part of Wales, to help take on new people, or at
the very least, safeguard already existing jobs? She raises an
important point, and we're looking at how we can secure more up to 
date GDP figures for Wales and the future, along the lines of those
available in Scotland. What assessment has the First Minister
made of the potential impact of the 2012 Olympic Games on Wales? We are
finalising an economic impact assessment of London 2012, tears 1,
2 and 3 contracts are with businesses in Wales and there is an
evaluation of the UK wide legacy of the Games. As you may be aware, the
European Tour operators Association has this month argued that the
tourism benefits of holding Olympic events are overstated sometimes.
Also, the recent comments by tourism experts, Mr John Waite,
that Wales has yet to capitalise fully on major events based tourism,
what commitments are you prepared to make to ensure that we further
developed the sector, which is particularly critical for the rural
Welsh economy? There is a government action plan on securing
the legacy for Wales. I believe that we had a good record of
securing tourism for major events. The Ryder Cup as a prime example
and the success of the Ryder Cup was added to encourage people to
travel around Wales. The wreck of clubs that benefited strongly from
the tourism.    there were golf clubs. First Minister, the action
plan securing the legacy for Wales stated that they will focus on
maximising the economic legacy for Wales by promoting trade and
investment, boosting tourism and enhancing Wales as global
reputation leading to, during and following the Games. Many
businesses in South Wales East, for example one of my constituents, was
concerned that they will not benefit from the Olympics and the
Paralympics, just like they did not see a boost in profits from the
Ryder Cup being on their doorstep. What assurances on the Welsh
government give to instil confidence in local businesses and
can you confirm that they will now reap the rewards for the Olympics
and the Paralympics. We're looking through the action plan that she
referred to ensure that there is a secure legacy for Wales. There are
sometimes put it is difficult to plan for an event that is cancels,
like the Welsh Tory conference in Wales! There are many hoteliers
that were left out of pocket because of the cancellation of the
Welsh Conservative conference! I want to be charitable to the party
opposite unsafe that of course we want to encourage major events in
Wales, but we cannot categorise the Welsh Tory conference as a major
The Minister of Wales has lost out significantly in terms of the
lottery my that we haven't received because of the Olympic Games
happening in Britain. Can you be certain that the economic benefits
are going to be approved to Wales as a result of the game's? Many of
the games they could have taken place, such as mountain bikes,
aren't going to be happening here. That is what the action plan wants
to achieve. We have a substantial legacy following the games. We have
to bear in mind as well that many teams will be coming to Wales to
train before the Games themselves, and that is also an opportunity to
sell Wales to those teams. Does the First Minister make any
representations to the UK government about the fact that the
changes to the welfare system will have one Welsh people? We have
expressed our concerns about the Ralph    well for reform.   
welfare reform. A further statement will be issued next month.
plans to slash the welfare budget by having a drastic effect on many
people throughout Wales and will continue to do so while these
ideological policies are being pursued. I'm sure many Welsh
families who are being hit by a substantial drop in income would
like to know where you stand on the question. Do you disagree with your
Labour Party colleague and shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who
effectively endorsed the coalition's right wing agenda when
he said that the next Labour government was going to have to
keep all these cuts. Do you agree with Ed Balls? That is not    that
is not what Ed Balls said. He said it is a difficult time to commit to
it. We don't know what a mess the UK will be in by 2015, so I think
it is wise of him. We as a party Stanford equality    stand for.
is incredibly disappointing that the Tory lead UK government has
pledged to press ahead with their plans to restrict DSA for Kim   
chemotherapy patients. As Macmillan the Cancer Support put it recently,
the idea that supporting cancer patients at the time of greatest
needs encourages dependency is utterly without foundation. Would
you agree with    agree with me that this is a completely
reprehensible move on the part of the Conservatives at Westminster,
and that the Tories at this end of the M4 should make it clear whether
they support these plans which leave thousands of cancer patients
losing out. You're absolutely right. Once again, it is a sad example of
the UK government saying that we'll all get together, but targeting the
most vulnerable in society. First Minister, the disability living
allowance is a prime example where it has remained largely unchanged
for the past 20 years. It is actually costing the working tax 
paying family about �3,000 per year. The number of people receiving DLA
has also risen by 30 % and we have now got almost a quarter of a
million people in Wales receiving this. Liam Byrne MP said last year
that they support a cap on benefit if it comes from public money. What
do you think? It is a great shame when offered the opportunity to do
it    to express support to cancer sufferers can the Conservative
Party in Wales have failed to do so. The opportunity was there in this
chamber to disagree with the UK's government proposals for cancer
sufferers and in support for cancer sufferers. It is a sad day that
that opportunity was not taken in this chamber. I share the First
Minister's concerns, and indeed Ed Balls', in the way to reform of
disability benefits has been operated. Last week, in my surgery,
I saw a young man had been booted off benefits and had been refused
support allowance because somebody said so. But this young man was
both physically and mentally completely unfit for work. He walks
with the stick and most the time he was forced to be standing well we
had a discussion because of his inability to sit down. On top of
that, he is agoraphobic and could only come to the surgery with the
support of a family member. The idea that this young man is ready
for work and that signing on at the job centre will give him a job, is
a complete travesty of the hold benefits system. He needs both
physical and mental also    support. And what indication does the Welsh
government have of the numbers of people in similar situations?
20th August 10 there were    2010 there were many people receiving
DLA. How can it be a fair reform of the system if, beforehand, a
minister declared that 20 % of people will lose their announced
what ever happens? That cannot be right. There needs to be it a
fundamental rethink. What action will the Welsh government be taking
to reduce poverty? The programme includes a commitment to tackling
poverty Action Plan. In recent survey highlighted that there is a
high level of child poverty in my constituency. To a poverty levels
will be increased    Child poverty levels will be increased as people
go back into work. It has a huge impact on people and could be
restricted to if people are helped back to work. What action as the
Welsh government taking to support families to get back into work?
issue of child care will be taken as part of the poverty Action Plan.
We'll take it forward in order to deal with the many problems that
farmers will face over the next few years as a consequence of policies
being pursued at Westminster. of the key objectives in your child
poverty strategy is to improve the skills of parents or carers and you
have people living in low income households, so they can fit   
secure well paid employment. Will the government's development   
what workers your government been doing to promote the relevant
skills required in those areas and what potential investment schemes
will be available to companies locating to those areas for the
development of work based training? We still await final confirmation
regarding capital allowances, but we are investing heavily in skills.
Particularly over the last two or three weeks. We also have a
fundamental commitment to double the number of families who are
eligible for the Flying Start scheme. That is an excellent way of
ensuring that people are able to access work, that they're able to
access the skills they need and that they have the support and
place in order to go to work. That is where the scheme will remain a  
  an important part of this government's work. You can see more
proceedings from the National Assembly on BBC Wales democracy
live website. Our Welsh affairs officer is back on the sofa with us.
No surprise that the First Minister's Questions kicked off
with a question about Scotland. Scotland is dominating the
political agenda across the UK at the moment. There will be a speech
tomorrow but the consultation process on how that independence
referendum will be held. Just a holding of the referendum but this
has implications for Wales. No surprise that this is very much on
the minds of politicians here. First Minister made the state of
the UK the theme of his new monthly press conferences yesterday. This
morning, another press conference from him to talk about what the
Labour Party was doing to deliver for Wales. Two big announcements in
two days, what does that mean? it a big announcement or not? The
opposition parties would say not. The delivery document was a bit of
spin, a bit of PR, because their continual attacks on Carwyn Jones
for not doing anything are beginning to get under his skin. Of
course, those two things are not mutually exclusive. It could be
that Carwyn Jones is annoyed that his being accused of doing nothing
because he feels he is doing quite a lot. But Labour felt the need to
put up this document and say, look, these attacks coming from the
opposition are simply not true in our view. The response from the
opposition parties has been quite damning. I didn't interview with
the leader of the concert as this morning. He said the government
would not know the meaning of the word delivery. I think the
opposition parties will be rubbing their hands slightly because the
shows that they have, if you like, irritated at the very least, the
Labour Party. We are running into local elections coming up in May.
The UK wide polls suggest that Labour may be falling back a bit,
it may not be quite as popular as they are. These are important
