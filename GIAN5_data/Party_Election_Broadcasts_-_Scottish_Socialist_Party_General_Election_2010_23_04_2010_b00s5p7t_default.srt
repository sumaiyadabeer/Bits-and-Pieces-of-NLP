Welcome again to That's Capitalism,
with me, your host, Benny Bigbucks.
And trying her luck tonight is Margaret.
Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling?
Well, I'm a bit nervous, but...
  Well...
  Well, let's play the only game in town  
Tha a a a t's Capitalism!
Fasten your seatbelt, Margaret. We're going to take you for a ride!
First topic is nuclear weapons.
How much will the next generation of Trident missiles cost?
  Must be millions...
  Now, hold on, Margaret!
Don't push that button just yet!
We're going to give you a few options.
Is it A   £20 billion?
B   £50 billion?
Or C   £100 billion?
They all seem like rather a lot.
Those babies pack a powerful punch!
  I'll guess B.
  £50 billion?
  Yes.
Oh, Mags, it's the wrong answer!
If you want to put the "do" in "doomsday", you've got to splash the cash!
It is £100 billion.
  I had no idea we spent so much...
Yeah, well, off to a bad start there, Margaret,
but...that's capitalism!
OK. Next question.
Unemployment.
Here we go.
Is the number of unemployed 16 to 24 year olds
more or less than 500,000?
Half a million? Well, it has to be less.
It's the wrong answer, Mags!
Oh, no, the real figure
is 952,000 16 to 24 year olds out of work.
That's more than the entire population of Glasgow!
Mmm! So, there's no points for you.
And, er...no point for your kids!
Next question.
Did the number of billionaires living in the UK last year
A   decrease, B   increase, or C   stay the same?
Well, there's been a lot of closures and job losses...
Yeah, the time's ticking, Margaret!
Well, it can't have gone up. A   decreased.
Oh, it's the wrong answer!
Oh, you forgot the first rule.
When you are struggling, the rich are getting richer.
Next question.
You may have noticed some minor economic difficulties recently,
but there will have to be cuts to essential services.
True or false?
False.
Oh, Margo! It's not your day, is it?
It's the wrong answer!
  No, no, it isn't!
  Yeah, well, there have to be cuts.
All the big parties are promising that there will be even deeper cuts
than that lovely Mrs Thatcher. Remember her?
The Scottish Socialist Party says
that if we scrapped Trident, took the troops home from Afghanistan
we wouldn't have to cut back on one penny or one job for essential services.
Listen, Margie, in this game, there has to be cuts.
That's the rules. Tha a a a t's Capitalism!
Well, I'm not playing this game any more.
The Scottish Socialist Party says
that you didn't cause the crisis, so you shouldn't have to foot the bill.
They say that throughout Scotland, we should build a mass movement
to resist cuts and redundancies, like we resisted the poll tax 20 years ago.
Capitalism is not the only game in town.
And we need a socialist alternative.
