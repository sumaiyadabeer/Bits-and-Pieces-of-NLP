Well, it's been six months, right?
  So, I'm thinking...
  Whoa! About time, dude!
Does Anja know?
Oh, OK, OK.
  I'm a skilled moth collector and now that we'll be away from streetlamps, I'll get better results.
  Hey, kid.
Um...my name is Connor.
Hey, Connor, shut up.
I was just telling them about my moth collection.
Don't make me pound you.
I get to go.
  Why?
  It's an educational opportunity.
And I told Dad you would keep an eye on me.
The thing is that there might be different activities for different grades, I might not be able to.
But your top priority will be to look after your sister, won't it?
Yes, Father.
Good.
I thought you hated camping.
I do. Bugs, cold, wet.
So why?
Because I'm going to catch something and it won't be bugs.
You like someone. Who?
I'll let you know if things work out, but Sav can't know.
  Why not?
  He has got a whole different set of rules than I do.
Only because I sold everyone at family dinner with the whole educational value.
Family dinner?
  Who was there?
  Oh, you know, everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins. So boring.
Come on, everyone's waiting.
All right, everyone. Welcome to the Degrassi ecology awareness trip,
whoo hoo! Now, you all have to fill out these forms to assess your carbon footprint on the planet.
  Where is Alli and Anya?
  They'll be right back.
Hi.
I'm Alli.
  What are you reading?
  A book.
That's a joke, right?
That would be correct.
  You ready to celebrate our six month?
  That's handy, now we can say we went out for exactly six months.
  I don't follow.
  Your last family gathering didn't include me.
  Alli...
  I didn't mean to spill the beans. We're done.
Do they give refunds on condoms?
Make sure you read your assignment guidelines closely.
They can be found online on the class website.
And let Mr Zilverman, your TA, know if you have any trouble logging in.
Please settle down, everyone. Take your seats.
Oh, thanks.
Can't have the roomy going hungry.
You're the best.
Now, I want you to pick a partner and you will work through a personality compatibility test...
  He's taken.
  And then give a nonclinical psychological report, OK?
Now if somebody can hit the lights, let's get started.
I'm freezing. Are you guys cold?
Shssh!
How's that?
Good. Thanks.
So grab your belongings, set up your camp, and then we'll start our game of survival, OK?
You're going to be divided into herbivores, omnivores and carnivores
and the only way you can win is to be alive at the end of the game, OK?
Are you going to freeze me out this whole trip?
Because I wanted to invite you, but my uncle just lost his job.
It didn't really seem like the best time.
I wrote a song for you.
I'll sing it to you if you let me.
A song?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Let's never break up again, OK?
Now, there's water and food stations hidden in the wood that you must find to fulfil your animals needs.
Now, I'll be here if you or your animal needs help, right here at base camp.
So, tonight out in the woods, kind of romantic, huh?
Oh, look, another water station. Now we only have to find one more.
Six months, that's a long time. When people have cared for each other for that long...
There you guys are.
  You're supposed to be with your friends.
  Oh, come on, Sav.
You know, it's actually a fun game, Alli, look.
You're an omnivore and you can tag Sav and I and get two life tags.
Did you mark your card with this water station?
So, Em, you know how we have that no roommate dating policy?
You can date Kelly.
  We'll be discreet.
  It's not a question of discretion.
Great, you like him, too.
Well, yeah, and he's made it clear that he's interested, too.
I don't know, honey, he's been sending me some pretty strong signals.
Oh, come on, you've got the history symposium guy and the library vending machine guy.
Kelly is the first decent guy that I've met here.
You always go for the guy guys I like.
  Excuse me!
  Uh, Craig?
Uh, we were 12! What about Damien?
You dated Damian for five minutes. And then you went out with Jay after me.
  I don't know how to put this, but I don't think you actually went out with Jay.
  Manny!
Look, this is stupid.
We agreed that no one gets Kelly.
I guess, but aren't you curious who he'd go for?
  No.
  Well, our compatibility assignment could tell us.
Well, just for fun of course.
Oh, of course.
Wait until you see, the white sheet almost looks black because so many moths and other insects land on it.
Still boring your friends to death?
Getting some spotted moths for my spotted moth tray.
Or not. Listen, kid, I'm doing you a favour, all right?
Nobody wants to hear you talk about spotted moths any more.
You shouldn't have done that.
Oh, I'm scared.
I'm scared.
Personally, I hate spotted moths.
Want to go for a walk?
OK, let's see, I have a very relaxed personality, from very true to very untrue.
Very true, I would say.
Seriously?
I have a very relaxed personality, Kelly has a very relaxed personality.
You don't let me eat a waffle if you think it'll cost us the best seats in class.
I tend to maintain my spaces in an orderly way.
My corner neat, Kelly's neater.
Yours looks like a thrift store threw up!
  Oh, here's a very true for you, I am a domineering person.
  Me? OK.
I'm attracted to unavailable people!
It looks like it's a draw.
  Hot dog?
  No, I'm good.
  Come on, I heard that you and Anya
were making out in the woods, that should have given you an appetite.
My dad packed me and my sister some food.
  Funny that you two are the ones getting all the action.
  What?
  Word is you're not the Bhandari who's been busy in the woods.
  I've got to go.
  What have you been up to?
  Johnny broke Conner's net,
but we're looking for moths and other nocturnal fauna.
  Have you heard your new nickname.
  No?
Backwoods Bhandari. They think you hooked up with Johnny.
That's awesome.
  You want them to call you that?
  It's cooler than Sav's little sister.
You know what? You'd better go to your tent.
Why, I didn't do anything? You're such a hypocrite, I saw the pack of condoms you brought.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
And you're worried about what people might think about me?
Go to your tent, now!
It's so unfair!
He's just worried about his little sister. That's what big brother's do.
No, he's worried about our family's reputation.
Well, it's because he cares about you.
Maybe, but he sounds just like my dad.
Is that so terrible?
It's hard to explain. You'd get it if you ever met my father.
  I wish I could.
  Me, too.
Family dinners would be way less boring with you there.
Thanks.
  So what do you think it would take for Sav to introduce me to your parents?
  You being Muslim.
I love to watch you cheer
It's been that way for half a year
It's like we belong so I wrote this song, yeah
You're my one
My only
Anya.
Dude, you make Peter seem like an awesome songwriter.
  Do you think she'll like it?
  Sadly, yes.
Hi, Anya.
Guys, why don't you come to Shanti's tent party? It'll be awesome.
Or not!
  Happy anniversary.
  Happy anniversary to you, too.
  Can I play you my Anya song?
  Of course.
Oh, but first, I have an anniversary present for you.
It's kind of special.
Yeah?
I want to become a Muslim for you.
You don't... You don't like the idea.
Of course I do, it's just I'm surprised.
You don't have to do that for me.
Well, it's because I love you.
Um...
You thought we'd have sex?
I just thought it was a possibility, maybe, but we don't have to if you don't want to.
But what if I do?
  Really?
  Yeah.
I think you've the wrong tent.
Nope.
So, where are your little friends?
They went to collect nocturnal specimens. Yawn!
Uhuh.
Thought maybe you might be doing something interesting.
  But I'm not, so maybe you should go.
  I don't mind, you read your book.
I'll just hang out.
  You're not going to give up, are you?
  No.
  Crazy eights?
  Poker.
Poker? Poker it is.
That was my best net. I'm going to get that boy good.
Was that supposed to be your poker face?
You know, you're not supposed to tell you have a killer hand.
Maybe I'm just happy to be spending time with you.
  Snake!
  What was that?
  Nothing.
  Shouldn't we check it out?
No, it's fine. It's all good. SCREAMING
That was Alli!
  It's a garter snake, totally harmless.
  Yeah, man, I know.
I thought it was a rattler.
  What were you and Johnny doing?
  Playing poker.
You were alone in a tent with a boy?
What is going on? Everyone go back to your tents.
The tents you're supposed to be in, all right? Go back.
Now, everyone, go!
Faster, faster, faster! Come on!
Kelly and I discovered we are compatible as friends or roommates
because we are both organised and like high levels of excitement.
But found that we would be completely incompatible as mates
because we have very different goals.
Thank you. That's excellent work.
Nelson and Santos.
I'm afraid that we are not ready for our presentation.
I see. And why would that be?
Well, we got caught up in some supplementary research.
I see.
(Supplementary research?)
(He's failed us.)
Boys on the left, girls on the right.
Sorry, I can't trust you after last night.
You are not going to tell Dad.
  Give me one reason not to.
  We were just playing cards.
Who cares what you were doing. You know what everyone thinks.
What about you and Anya? What were you doing? You had your shirt off!
  Well, we're not talking about me and Anja, we're talking about you.
  I'm not an impure girl.
People are going to think you are.
They'll say you're not good enough for their family, is that what you want?
Yes, that's exactly what I want(!)
We lost a whole letter grade,
now we have to work just as hard and the best we can hope for is a B.
What's that? Is that the sound of a very relaxed personality?
Seriously, this is bad.
We're here for school, we should never have gone down the Kelly road.
  What?
  He's so cute and we have to live with him.
  That's a lot of tension, right?
  Manny!
What would be the harm in asking him, for fun, of course.
  Manny, no.
  And if he happens to like one of us
then we can make a mature decision on how to proceed.
If you're uncomfortable with that I can just tell him I like him.
Not if I tell him first.
  Guys, the sock on the door?
  Oh!
  We should go.
The sock. Yeah.
Hey, I'll call you tonight.
I wouldn't have thought you'd have anything to say to an impure girl.
I wasn't talking about you.
Well, you could have been.
I was alone in a tent with a boy, just like Alli.
It's not the same, though.
Sure it is. We wanted to be together
and now according to your double standard I'm not good enough for you
or your family.
Hey! We don't get it.
The sociological psychological measures chapter?
  Me neither.
  No, you.
I mean, you walk around here flirting with us
and then we find you making out with Gwyneth!
  What?
  Well, you're always so comforting.
And thoughtful. What's that about?
Being a good roommate.
So, you're not into either one of us like that?
We're roommates, no dating, wasn't that the deal?
You're not answering the question.
To be honest, you're a little scary right now.
You're both fantastic
and, yes, if it wasn't for the no roommate dating rule
I would definitely be into one of you.
I'm going to go study at the library.
I'll try to be a little less comforting and thoughtful
when I get back.
Definitely into one of us?
Which one?
  We can't go there.
  No, no.
I've texted her 20 times since we got back, nothing.
She'll be here any second saying, "Oh, let's never break up again!"
You see?
I'm sorry if I pressured you.
We can wait as long as you want.
I just want to hang out with you and I never got to play you my song.
Women are equal to men.
Well, yeah.
So if what I did was bad, then you were just as wrong to be with me.
I... I don't think you're bad.
I'm sorry, I just meant...
It's got everything you ever gave me in it, the CDs, Stooges t shirt,
the poem, the bracelet and stickers.
