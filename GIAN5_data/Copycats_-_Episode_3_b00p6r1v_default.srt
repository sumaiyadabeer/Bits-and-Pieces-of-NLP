Hello!
Welcome to Copycats, the game show where copying is good.
  If you're good at copying.
  Very true.
The aim of the game is to gain as many points as you can
because only one family today can go home with the secret Copycats prize.
Shall we meet the families?
First off, we've got Daniel's family from London!
We've got Ire's family from Essex.
Nice. Daniel, you're the head of your family. Introduce the rest, please.
This is my brother, Tom. He loves sports.
This is my sister, Caitlin and she's a dancer.
This is my cousin, Emma, she's a smiley cheerleader.
This is my dad...and he's tall
cos he ate his vegetables.
This is my mum. She's short. She didn't eat her vegetables.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
It's great to have you on the show. Good luck.
Ire, you're head of your family. Introduce them.
  My brother, Toluwa. He likes Michael Jackson.
  How you doing?
  My cousin, Mayowa, who likes to read books.
  Hi.
  My cousin, Yetundae, who travels the world.
  Hello.
  My mum, Lola, who's constantly on her laptop.
  Hello!
  My dad, Ola, who likes to sing.
  Hello, everybody!
  He even sung that! Excellent.
  All right!
Families, welcome to the show.
Before the show, we tossed a coin to see who would go first or second.
  Ire's, you won. Do you want to go first or second?
  Second, please.
All right. Daniel's family, you're going first. Let's play Copycats.
This first round is called Mime Time.
Emma, I'm going to get you to pick one of these cards.
  Right.
  You'll have ten seconds to mime the action on the card
and so on down the line.
  Close the doors!
  Close the doors!
Emma, pick a card. Silver, red or blue.
Silver. Ooh.
  Reckon you can mime that?
  Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
  Sure? OK.
  You've got ten seconds, starting from now.
Her face!
Ha ha! All right. Daniel, your turn.
All right. Martin, your turn.
All right, Caitlin, go for it.
Wow. All right, Liz. Go for it.
Take a good look, Tom. We'll ask you what this is in a second.
All right! Oh, well, this is good. Right, Tom.
For a maximum of 50 points, any idea what Liz was doing there?
I think she was dancing while she was holding a pole.
She wasn't. It did look like that, but that's not what we're after.
We're playing for 40 points. Open the door, please.
  Liz, any idea what Caitlin was doing?
  Was she on a rollercoaster?
  Good guess.
  Good thinking, but it's not what we're looking for.
We're playing for 30 points. Caitlin, any idea what Martin was doing?
Er... riding a motorbike?
He wasn't. For 20 points, Martin.
Er...dricing a sports car.
ThatÂ¬'s not the answer we're looking for. OK, for 10 points.
Daniel, what do you reckon it was?
  Waterskiing.
  That's not the right answer.
  Emma, do you want to tell everybody what you were doing?
  No!
  Go on, go on!
  I was mowing the lawn   very badly.
Course she was!
Unfortunately at the end of that first round, you score zero.
Let's see how Ire's family get on.
Close the doors!
Close the doors!
He's got some good pipes on him! Red or blue?
  Blue.
  OK, have a look at that.
  Reckon?
  I should think so.
Well, good luck to you.
Your ten seconds start now. Open the doors.
Yeah, keep going, keep going. Use your ten seconds.
That's it, mate. OK.
(Oh dear!)
Oh.
Yeah!
  Brilliant!
Oh, boy!
This show is brilliant!
OK, for maximum points, please can you tell us what Ola was doing?
I'm gonna go for dancing.
He was indeed dancing but it's not what's on the card.
Let's open the door, please.
OK, for 40 points, any idea?
  Swimming.
  Is that how you swim?
It wasn't.
Open the door. OK, for 30 points, what was Lola doing?
I think she was throwing paint on a wall.
It's not right. Open the doors again, for 20 points, any ideas?
  Washing the window?
  It is wrong. I'm sorry.
  Playing tennis?
  She was not playing tennis.
  OK, Yetundae, tell us what you were doing.
  I was throwing the javelin.
Unfortunately, Ire's family, you get zero points.
Oh, that means we have a tie on our hands. We need to decide
who will be playing in the next game.
  There is only one possible way.
  What do you mean?
Stone, paper, scissors!
Yeah!
OK, Ire and Daniel, come join me and Mark in the middle.
Here we go. Whoever wins this plays the next game.
Fists up, guys. Go on "go".
  One, two...go!
  Oh!
Stone blunts scissors, so Daniel, you win that.
Well done.
It also means that your family are playing the next game
which is Doughnut Dash.
Welcome to Doughnut Dash.
This is how this game works.
One at a time our team will pull themselves along this blue rope
in, you've guessed it, a giant, inflatable doughnut.
At this end, they'll get these smaller doughnuts
put them on their silly hat and take it back to the start.
50 points are up for grabs if you complete this in the time limit but,
  if you fail, 25 points will go to Ire's famiy.
  For doing absolutely...
Nowt!
Good luck, guys. In three, two, one...
Go! HONK!
Yeah, baby, yeah!
This is where it gets tricky, going back.
  Oh. Oh, wow.
  Yeah!
  Nice work.
  Nice work, guys.
Go for it! Go for it!
That's really fast.
Yeah!
Come on. Go, go!
Oh, nice.
Go on, kid.
  Oh!
  Excellent.
Go, Caitlin.
Caitlin, nice.
Go Caitlin!
Yeah!
  Smile on her face.
  Well done, Caitlin!
Yeah!
Go on, Dad!
Oh, oh, hello!
  Oh, yeah.
  Yeah!
Go on, Dad!
  Yeah!
  Yeah!
Come on, Martin.
Brilliant. Nice.
This is good, guys. Two doughnuts left.
Woohoo!
Shorty now. That's fast!
Nearly there.
  Go!
  Come on, guys, you're doing so well.
One doughnut left, guys.
Go, Dan!
  That's fast. That's nice.
  Come on, guys.
Go on, Daniel. Nearly there.
  Whoa!
  Whoa!
Nearly. Yes!
  Go, Daniel!
  Go, Daniel!
Go, go, go, go!
Fifteen seconds.
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Nine, eight, seven,
six...
Yeah!
Woo!
  Nice one, guys.
  I thought you'd lost it there, Daniel.
You've got the full 50 points.
Overall scores at the minute are...
In the lead are Daniel's family!
This next round is called Quick On The Draw.
  Yeah!
  Will you hold that for me?
OK, Ola, I have in my hand three cards.
You'll pick a card and draw whatever is on that card
and so on down the line. 50 points are up for grabs.
  You really, really need them.
  All right.
  Best of luck. Close the doors!
  Close the doors!
  Silver, red or blue.
  I'll go for
  the red.
  All right, have a look at that.
  Oh, lovely.
  "Oh, lovely"!
Your ten seconds starts now. Open the doors.
Keep watching, mate, keep watching.
Big scribble there.
Yetundae looks a bit confused.
Interesting.
OK, Ire.
OK, she just went, "Huh?"
  All right!
  Ha ha!
  It was a tricky one.
You all right there, Lola?
OK, for the maximum of 50 points, any idea what Lola was drawing?
  Er...picture of the sun?
  It's not what we've got on the card.
It does look like that though. OK, 40 points,
  any idea?
  Oh!
It's like a house, with the sun...
  sunny house?
  We're not looking for a sunny house, I'm afraid.
For 30 points, mate, what has Yetundae drawn there?
  Is it a camera?
  Yeah!
Congratulations Ire's family. You get 30 points.
I'll do this in the style of a superhero.
Close the doors!
Close the doors!
Right, pick a card.
Blue, he's gone for the blue one.
  Can you draw that?
  I got it.
Best of luck. My neck's hurting from looking up at you.
You've got ten seconds starting from now.
Very good.
Tom, go for it.
Ten seconds is not a long time.
Emma, your turn.
All right, Daniel. LAUGHS
Ah!
It's good, yeah.
Right, Caitlin, this is going to be pretty hard, I reckon.
  For 50 points, any idea what Liz has drawn?
  A sheep.
It looks like one, but that's not what we're looking for.
OK, right.
We're playing for 40 points. What do you reckon it is?
Before he put that head on it, I was going to go for a tree.
Oh, yeah. A tree with a head. Yeah.
It's not. OK.
For 30 points, Daniel, any idea? Any idea?
  A cloud.
  It's not a cloud. We're playing for 20 points.
  Emma?
  OK, it's a bird.
That's not the answer we're looking for.
OK, we're playing for ten points.
Tom. That's a good drawing! Any idea what Martin has drawn?
  A duck.
  Oh! You're so close!
But it's not. Martin, tell everybody.
It was a chicken.
  Aah.
  You were mean there. You were really mean.
Everybody went, "Is that a bird?" You went, "No."
It's not that answer we're looking for, I'm sorry.
You get no points. Sorry, guys.
Right, Ire's family. Are you ready and raring?
Yeah!
Ire's family are ready to play Basket Heads.
Yay!
Welcome to Basket Heads. The way this game works is very, very simple.
The throwers throw a ball into the basket heads.
The basket heads stilt their way... I'm not very good on these stilts!
I hope you're better. OK.
..over to the big one here and then they put it in.
Yeah!
50 points are up for grabs if you can get 15 balls into that basket
before the time runs out.
If you don't, 25 points will go to Daniel's family.
OK, here we go. In three, two, one, go!
Go, go! Guys, go for it.
Now we're cookin'! Come on!
Come on now, lads.
Come on, guys, this is it.
I think Lola's been lapped!
You got that one in in the last second.
Remember, you need 15 balls to get the full 50 points.
One, two, three...
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine...
ten, eleven.
Aww!
Sorry, guys, that means 25 points go to Daniel's family.
OK, the overall scores:
Welcome to the Music Round.
Liz, you pick a popular tune and you then have ten seconds
to recreate that tune using this highly sophisticated instrument.
What're you on about? You told me to bring my tambourine.
No?
No!
  No?
  No!
OK, can everybody except Liz please put your headphones on
so you don't hear the song that has been selected.
  Thank you very much.
  They won't be able to hear this tambourine.
  Close the doors!
  Close the doors!
OK, here we go, Liz, pick a card.
  I'll go for the middle one.
  Blue one. Take a look.
You think you know that tune?
I'd need to hear it first.
OK, don't worry, we shall play it into the studio right now.
If there's something strange in the neighbourhood
Who you gonna call?
Ghostbusters!
Ten seconds starting from now.
OK, Tom, your turn.
Yeah! Martin, go for it.
Caitlin, your turn.
OK, Emma.
All right. OK.
Wow.
  Daniel, any idea what Emma was playing there?
  No!
Brilliant. Take a guess?
OK. Let It Be.
Cracking song. It's not, though, sorry.
OK, we're playing for 40 points.
Emma, any idea what Caitlin was playing?
I'm A Barbie Girl.
It wasn't. We're playing for 30 points.
  Caitlin, any idea what Martin was playing?
  Erm...
  Humpty Dumpty.
  It wasn't Humpty Dumpty.
For 20 points, Martin, any idea?
It must be I Believe I Can Fly.
Oh, what?
It's not. For ten points, finally, Tom, any idea what Liz was playing?
Ghostbusters.
Well done guys, ten points!
I'm gonna dance this one out.
Close the doors!
  OK, Lola   silver or red?
  Red.
OK, have a look at that.
Wow!
We're gonna play into the studio now.
OK, fantastic. Good luck, Lola. Ten seconds start now  
open the doors.
Dancing!
Wow!
That was beautiful!
That...was fantastic!
All right, for the full 50 points, any idea what Ola was playing?
  Beautiful by Akon?
  It's not that.
Let's open the doors. For 40 points, any idea what that was, mate?
  No idea?
  No. Sorry.
  That's fine.
  For 30 points, now. Any idea what she was playing?
  Sounded like Swan Lake or something.
  Swan Lake!
It is not, unfortunately.
Let's move on. For 20 points?
I know the song but I can't remember the name!
I hate when that happens!
  So annoying.
  Frustrating.
  I can't!
  We'll play for ten points. Open the doors.
  Tragedy.
  Yay!
10 points is better than none!
The overall scores are...
Don't worry cos it's all to play for as we go into our final game  
Hamster ball Havoc!
Welcome to Hamster ball Havoc!
This is the big decider   whichever family has the most points
at the end of this game will go home with today's secret Copycats prize!
Ooooh!
Ooh, indeed! This is how this works  
our families will try to get round this obstacle course
as quickly as they can,
without knocking over any of these balls, cos every time they do,
25 points gets deducted from their overall score!
The first family to cross this finish line will win a massive 100 points.
There is only 45 points between them!
Right, Ire's family in the orange hamster balls and Daniel's family
in the purple hamster balls.
In three, two, one...go!
Ire's cousin Yetundae leads off the orange team
and its Daniel's mum Liz for the purples.
Pretty even early on. No one going for it yet
but Yetundae is speeding up now as she goes clear of the pillars.
So does Liz, racing away out of the studio.
Yetundae clears the corner into the back straight, past Liz.
There's nothing in it so far.
The ladies head back into the studio but who can take this first lap?
They've both slowed up again.
No one wants to knock over those penalty pillars...
Liz shoves past Yetundae and a ball falls   that's 25 points away!
But it's still very close, as Toluwa heads out for the oranges.
It's Tom for the purples.
The boys go clear of the pillars and it's pretty much neck and neck.
Out the studio they go, round the corner and into the back straight.
The boys deciding to avoid a major collision there...
Oh! That's Tom down. That could be costly for the purples..
This time, they're not avoiding anyone!
Smash!
There's nothing between them!
Oh, no! Toluwa hits a pillar and down goes the ball, and 25 points.
Tom's last up for the purples and it's Ire for the oranges.
Can they go clear of the pillars?
Yes, they can! These boys look well matched.
You say that   look at Ire go there, though!
I think he's knocked Tom over!
He's back up again but can he catch up?
Ire is flying into the studio but here comes Tom!
Ire's nearly there, surely he's got this!
  Wow! What a race.
  That was a good race. Very good.
Time for the moment of truth.
Daniel's family, unfortunately, came second in that race,
so we have to take 25 points off.
Daniel's family's final score is...
Ire's family won the race, well done. You've earned 100 points.
But you did knock over two balls.
So, Ire's family's final score of the day is...
Which means you're the winners! Well done, guys.
Let's see what you've won.
Tread the boards at a top West End theatre
and tour backstage at a big West End musical,
on this Theatre Club kid's prize, plus tickets to a top West End show
for all the family!
Nice one, guys. Have a cracking day out.
  It's the end of the show...
  Aw!
Join us next time on Copycats!
