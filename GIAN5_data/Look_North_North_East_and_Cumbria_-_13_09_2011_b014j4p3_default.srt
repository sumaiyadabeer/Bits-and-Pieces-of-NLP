Welcome to Tuesday's Look North. In tonight's headlines: Victim of the
felled in gale force winds. One year on, the family of a former
recover. Deadly duty. On patrol with a North Yorks soldier who has
one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. And cool running. The
man who decided he needed to make this year's Great North Run a bit
more difficult. In sport   more fallout from the departure of
Sunderland's record signing. But Newcastle are flying high. Fourth
in the Premier League after fighting hard for a goalless draw
in the capital. A lovely man who would do anything for anyone. Just
falling tree. George Brown, from High Etherley in County Durham,
died yesterday afternoon on the A688 between Staindrop and Barnard
Castle as the remnants of Hurricane Katia brought with it winds of more
than 70mph. He was driving to collect patients on behalf of
Butterwick Hospice in Bishop Auckland when the tree fell on his
ambulance. Stephanie Lloyd reports. The human cost of the storms that
battered the region. 68 year old George Brown, a much loved
volunteer driver for Butterwick Hospice died as he was driving in
the high winds. Killed on a journey he used to make every week. George
was lovely, he volunteered his time freely to us for more than 12 years
and inevitably, when these things happen, people reflect on their
memories of George and everyone says he would do everything for
anybody. He really enjoyed supporting the charity and driving
patients from their homes to the hospice. Staff at the hospice are
camera. This is where the accident happened, between Staindrop and
Barnard Castle. Flowers have been left. The ambulance was on its way
to an outreach hospice to collect patients when the tree fell on to
the minibus, killing George Brown. But Mr Brown was not travelling
alone. He had another volunteer sitting directly behind him. He is
being treated in hospital but his injuries were not thought to be
life threatening. George Brown leaves a wife, Mary, a son and a
daughter and three grandchildren. A man described by those who knew and
loved him as selfless and loyal. his retirement, the hospice really
became a volunteer job for him and he would do anything and he did not
only the driving but when we had the Christmas party, George was
Father Christmas. That is indicative of the man he was.
Nearly 400 homes were still without power this afternoon because of the
high winds. CE Electric says 265 homes were affected in
Northumberland and Durham. And almost 100 were without electricity
on Teesside and in North Yorkshire. But the company expects to have
most people reconnected by this evening and does not expect the
situation to get any worse. Although the wind is still high, we
are not expecting too many problems on the we are still seeing the
tail end of some wind coming in. If customers are all supply after 7pm
tonight, give us a call and we will get somebody out to see you and get
you on to the supplier as quickly as possible. It must be a living
torture. One year ago, former Middlesbrough footballer Gary
Parkinson suffered a major stroke at 42 that left him with so called
locked in syndrome. He's fully aware of what's happening around
him but can't move or speak. His family say he has made some
progress and have taken inspiration from other people who've managed to
make a full recovery from the condition. The doctors said to me,
this isn't looking good. Do you want and kept alive with the
machine? I said, yes, he will keep going. Sat by his bedside, Deborah
Parkinson told her husband he had to keep fighting. At that point and
I said this to Gary, his eyes were opened and I knew that he could
hear inside and there was something we could keep fighting for. Gary
was later diagnosed with locked in syndrome. He communicates with his
family by moving his eyes up for yes and down for no. His former
club has staged benefit matches, charity events and tribute dinners.
His family have received thousands of goodwill messages from friends,
fans and former players. It has been brilliant, all of those clubs
have come together. Fans from every club. We cannot believe the support.
Most of the time, they were booing and shouting at players. But on the
club's say he was a legend. support, they say, has kept them
going. And the family say they take inspiration from people like Kate
Allatt, who has visited Gary after making a full recovery from locked 
in syndrome. If one person has made it through, there is no reason we
cannot. I have since found out that many people have come through and
their leading and good quality of life. Gary has moved his fingers
for the first time. Progress is slow. But as his family know,
people have been a full recovery from his condition. Our next report
contains extraordinary footage of one of the most dangerous jobs on
earth. The BBC has been given an exclusive opportunity to film bomb
disposal squads at work in Afghanistan. One member of the
squad is 29 year old Adam Galloway from North Yorkshire. Cathy Killick
reports on the realities of a job that carries the risk of death and
injury every day. Last year they killed or wounded 8500 coalition
troops and 11,000 Afghans. IEDs, improvised explosive devices, are
the Taliban's chief weapon in Afghanistan. Captain Adam
Galloway's job is to destroy them before they destroy others. We know
that they know where we're likely to go. They know the place more
intimately. And it does work, it slows us down, it breaks morale. It
costs us money. It achieves all of those things that very little cost.
To them. This is the first time the MoD has allowed disposal to be
filmed. We are at Helmand Province, as suspected booby trap and the
dog's reaction is the first sign that exposes our present. Searchers
sweep the ground and pinpoint wires and a battery. Then add and is
approached to defuse the bomb. don't see much made in setting
myself out. There is luck involved in everything. If I went around
thinking the next day would be my last, I would not be able to work.
There is a lot at stake. In North Yorkshire, his wife and daughter
love having him home. But his job carries a risk that he might
disappear from their lives. Fingertips into the like... We can
see the pressure plate. The job demands total focus. The exposed
wires must be cut. And then uses clippers that can be triggered from
a distance. We are expecting an explosion. That isn't the end of it.
And underneath the pressure plate. Directly underneath... We're good
to go. Firing! It is now safe to retrieve the bomb components and
explosives. It will be examined for clues but stemming the tide of
these bombs is proving difficult. Around 1000 or planted each month.
The five kilos of explosives are blown up and Adam poses with his
diffused bomb. It has taken for people four hours. One morning's
work and they're lucky to survive. You can see more of Captain
Galloway's story in The Bomb Squad tonight on BBC One at 10.35pm.
Another soldier from the bomb disposal team has been describing
how he managed not to miss the birth of his son, despite serving
in Afghanistan when his wife into labour. Armed with a fully topped 
up phone card, he managed to listen in on the momentous occasion.
Luckily, his 100 minutes of credit lasted just long enough for
Corporal Chris Ashton from York to hear the first cries of little
Alfie. Peter Lugg has been to see the family. Mobile phones have
played a significant part in the life of soldier Chris Ashton
recently. This is his wife, Laura, with his baby son, Alfie, born on
the 1st of September. On that day, when Laura went into labour at York
Hospital, Chris was 4,000 miles away serving with the Royal
Engineers in Afghanistan. When his son was born, Chris was performing
a vital role at Camp Bastion, part of a team searching for IEDs.
ringing every hour, just to see how she was progressing. And as a
quarter, it was 9:45pm. He started pushing and that was it. Luckily,
my friend had given me a phone card with 100 minutes. That was lucky, I
really needed them. And I got to hear the birth over the phone.
Knowing that he was on the other end of the phone was nice. Just to
imagine he was there. Even the way could not speak to him. We have a
picture showing Alfie with the phone! Yes! So that his dad could
see a few words. I wanted to say hello to my little man. The midwife
was really good. She let him have a conversation with me and I told him
I would be home soon. The army gave him paternity leave but it still
took him four days to get home. was supposed to be coming back in
September. Four days is better than four weeks. Soldiers are hopeless!
Yes! But we knew that from the beginning. It was nice to have him
back earlier. With Chris's older son, Jay, the whole family can now
look forward to spending some quality time together. Some fathers
will do anything to get out of being that delivery run! Best
wishes to them. Last Chance Saloon. That's how a police firearms
tactical advisor described the unlicensed Taser weapons used at
the end of the standoff with Raoul Moat. Giving evidence from behind a
screen, he told an inquest jury that the priority had always been
to keep the gunman alive. And the only viable option they had were
Tasers which hadn't been approved for use by police in the UK. Chris
Stewart reports. This is the Taser the officer was describing. Fired
from a shotgun, the X12 projectile delivers a powerful electrical
current. He said it was the big brother of the Tasers the police
normally use. The officer identified himself only as A10. He
said the Tasers were delivered here to Rothbury in Northumberland two
or three hours after the standoff had begun. He knew of the existence
of the Xrep, but had never seen it. During the standoff he was based at
force headquarter in Ponteland. It was very frantic and hectic, he
said. He said the decision had already been taken to use this as a
pre emptive strike if Raoul Moat was about to take his life. The
inquest has heard how he had slid his gun from beneath his chin to
his temple and the log records that one officer deployed the X12, which
hit them and he then discharged his shot gone into his temple. At some
point as second taser was deployed. Moat had gone on the run after
shooting and injuring his girlfriend, shooting and killing
her new partner and shooting and blinding a policeman. The inquest
into his death is expected to take a further two and a half weeks.
We're often hearing how tough it can be for young people in our
region looking for jobs. But in west Cumbria, the steel giant Tata
has just taken on its biggest intake of young apprentices for
over a decade. 20 teenagers have just started out on a three and a 
half year scheme with high hopes of a rewarding career. Steel has real
historic heritage here. The new apprentices are being offered a
modern route to long term career. wanted this apprenticeship because
it offers all the qualifications that I want. For full time
employment as a mechanical engineer. I was really happy when I found out.
I did not mind staying on a school but it is hands on him the
apprenticeship and I don't want just to be taught to, I wanted to
be hands on. That is possible, say bosses, because the markets are
opening. We are moving into the nuclear market and you could
decommissioning. Defence, we have secured defence related contracts
and we are starting to look at renewable energy. In its heyday,
around 10,000 people would have been employed here in the steel
industry in Workington. Why that has declined over the years, there
has been an improvement in the last 12 months and in that time, data
Steel has taken on around 100 new people and many have been young and
local. Without doubt there are good opportunities, our business is
growing quickly and it's really positive and there are good
opportunities for kids in this area. The political map of the North East
and Cumbria could be massively altered in changes proposed today.
Four of our MPs will go altogether. Others will end up representing new
areas as all the boundaries are redrawn. It's all about cutting the
size of Parliament. But it will lead to much bigger constituencies.
Richard Moss is in one of the communities affected. This is
Hexham, very picturesque and one of the biggest constituencies in
England. But it's about to get even better because it will be extended
further into Northumberland and into parts of Gateshead. As one of
the quirks of this process, it will also have to lose parts. At 20
minute drive down the road will become part of County Down and and
one and have farmers try from the town. Northumberland isn't the only
committee affected by this shake up. The great cull of MPs will lead to
fewer seats in the North East and Cumbria by 2015. In all, the number
will drop from 35 to 31. Cumbria will lose one MP, Northumberland
another and one will also go in each of Tyneside and Teesside. And
some of the seats will become huge. Hexham will become the biggest in
England, spanning over 2,600 square kilometres. In Northumberland, it's
fairly rural and that means an order for us to design a seat which
contains the right number of constituents, that seat must be
much larger than any inner city area but also other parts of the
country. But the changes will produce some pretty strange
bedfellows. One constituency will combine Whitehaven and Bowness on 
Windermere. Another, Haltwhistle in Northumberland with Barnard Castle
in Durham. A third puts Rowlands Gill in Gateshead, with Rothbury in
Northumberland. And it doesn't stop there. I have come to Cramlington.
In the boundary changes, it isn't placed with anywhere else in
Northumberland and it will be the seat with large slices of Newcastle.
Anthony Charles has been duly elected... And the changes could
also lead to some surprises and casualties. Tony Blair used to pile
up huge Labour majorities in his Sedgefield seat, but its new
boundaries could make it a Tory target. While the Cumbrian
Conservative MP, Rory Stewart, faces a fight with Lib Dem
President and coalition partner, Tim Farron, for a new Kendal and
Penrith seat. These proposals are not set in stone, there will be a
consultation for 12 weeks. And the Conservative MP for Hexham says he
will object to some specific proposals for the spirit, even
though he supports the idea for a smaller house of Commons. MPs will
wonder if they have a job after the next election and if you are
wondering what this means to you, more details on my blog on the
website. Plenty more to come in tonight's Look North. Fridge
challenge. The man who's making his Great North Run even more difficult.
And the wind is dying down. But it is a slow process! It is time for
the sport. I will say this cautiously. Things going well for
Newcastle? Pretty good start. Newcastle United fans are pinching
themselves. A goalless draw at newly promoted Queen's Park Rangers
last night has lifted the Magpies to fourth place in the Premier
League table. That's despite all the criticism at the club's failure
to make any transfer deadline day additions to their squad. Mark
Tulip reports. Further evidence before and after last night's
goalless draw in West London that Joey Barton still has a lot of time
for the Newcastle team mates he left behind. Barton captained his
new club Queen's Park Rangers but in truth was subdued during a match
which saw the Magpies do just enough to rise to the dizzy heights
of fourth in the table. There wasn't much for another king of
Twitter to report. This was about the nearest Newcastle got to
scoring and the failure to recruit a top striker in the transfer
window may yet come back to haunt them. QPR didn't have enough
cutting edge in front of goal, either. But let's not be too
churlish. Defensively, United are looking pretty solid and an away
point against a club whose new owner splashed the cash in late
August isn't a bad result, especially when there are 16 clubs
below you. Ant and Dec looked on from the Loftus Road stands as Mr
Yellow Card, Chiek Tiote, clattered his former team mate. But to keep
punching above their weight, United will need to play better and get
their shooting boots on. Talk of Champions League football may be a
little premature. More problems for Sunderland today. The Football
Association has charged full back and Player of the Year Phil
Bardsley with violent conduct. That's after this challenge, when
he appeared to stamp on Chelsea's Spanish midfielder Juan Mata during
Saturday's game at the Stadium of Light. Bardsley now faces a three 
match ban. And the fallout has continued following the shock
departure of Sunderland's record signing, Asamoah Gyan, to a club in
the United Arab Emirates. Al Ain have paid the Wearsiders a reported
�6 million loan fee. Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn said the deal
made financial sense given the clear desire of the player to leave
Wearside. But while Quinn has left the door open for Gyan to return,
for many, the saga is another sign of the times. The fans do not feel
if they can connect to the players because the players are mercenaries.
In the past you would have players who would stay for years. As they
did it as a kid. But now it's about money. And they are controlled by
agents. They're just a commodity and it is the agent's job to make
as much money as they possibly can. Elsewhere, Carlisle United are at
Tranmere tonight. Commentary on BBC Radio Cumbria. Cricket now, and
Yorkshire chairman Colin Graves has called his players a disgrace after
their County Championship relegation. He says the
performances have been unacceptable. Meanwhile, Durham are hanging on to
their faint hopes of winning the Division One title. They bowled
Worcestershire out for 288. They lead by 27 runs with all wickets
standing. Whitehaven rugby league club is looking for a new coach
following their season ending playoff defeat at Doncaster. David
Seeds has resigned, explaining he needed a break after 18 years at
the West Cumbrian club as both player and coach. There are just
five days to go until the Great North Run and many taking part have
already got a few under their belt. I had eight of them and you have
one. When he beat be? So what do you do to stand out from the crowd?
For one Tyneside man, the answer is obvious. Do it with a fridge
strapped your back. Tony Morrison has run the famous route 15 times
and he was worried he wouldn't get enough sponsorship unless he did
something a bit different this year. Damian O'Neil reports. People in
funny costumes are a common sight on the Great North Run, but unless
you know different, no one has ever done it with a fridge on their back.
On the day itself, it'll be kitted out with a sound system so that
Tony can listen to music while he runs, but for today's training,
it's just the fridge. It will way in excess of 40 kilos. We will have
a car battery with 200 watt speakers. We are busy putting
together some good tunes on my iPod. So we can cheer up the ladders
along the way. We will make a bit of a noise! Do you expect to run
the whole thing? I do! I am not sure what the record is for a man
with the fridge. But by plan is to make people aware of the charity
that has a massive effect on local society. If people can donate, that
would be fabulous. It's a pretty daunting challenge that Tony has
ahead of him, but his trainer believes he has what it takes.
is one of the strongest, fittest men I have ever come across and he
has a strong mind, what is important, especially with caring
that fridge. He will need the strength of mind to get to the end.
But he is a very strong individual. He would just need to watch is the
work back!    his lower back. hopes to raise over �2000 for South
Tyneside Football Trust this Sunday. If you see him during the run, he'd
appreciate your support. And you shouldn't have much trouble
spotting him... Absolutely mad! He says the door will be stuck shut so
people cannot look in to see if he has any drink in there! We have
some interesting were the pictures. Jeff was quite surprised to see
this waterfall been blown up hell in Wensleydale! And a very odd
tumble picture in Darlington. The geese migrating. How long will this
last? Not much longer, the rest of the week will become gradually less
Tonight, low pressure so very lively at the moment. Tomorrow, we
Look at there's day, high pressure, early a breath of wind and plenty
of sunshine. Easily the best day of the week. Friday, the next round of
weather system tumbles in. Rain and stronger breezes. Thursday is that
hours it will peter out to leave one or two little drizzle the
outbreaks. Overnight lows of around 11 degrees and still that lively
westerly breeze. Wednesday, the crowd and players but brightness
coming through early. The showers will not away and they will be
replaced in the afternoon everywhere with good strong
sunshine. Still some heat at this time of year and highs of 14   17
Celsius. Not to Chile. The rest of the week? There's still looks like
the best day all round. 16 Celsius but still feeling warm or with
those very light winds. Cumbria, it works at the same. Thursday is the
best before the showers and the breeze return on Friday. Easy to
remember. Time for a last look at tonight's headlines. Tributes have
died yesterday afternoon. And the cost of living rises again as
