Look at all my friends!
I'll tell you why...
There was a time when Buffalo didn't have horns.
He just had very long, shaggy hair.
Jambo, Monkeys!
  Jambo, Buffalo!
Buffalo was at home eating reeds at the edge of the swamp.
Until one day...
  Huh?
  Woo!
  Did you see that?
  The swamp moved!
  Huh? What is going on?
  The swamp is getting bigger!
  Move back, Buffalo!
Move back!
  We'll help you find somewhere else.
  But I live here.
  Try the plains!
  I will! Thank you, Monkeys!
  And Buffalo had to find a new home.
  Ooh!
  A new home. A new home. Jambo, everyone!
  Jambo, everyone! Jambo, everyone!
  Jambo, Buffalo.
  The swamp is getting bigger
and I'm looking for a new home.
  Would you mind if I stayed here on the plains?
  Of course, Buffalo.
You're welcome to stay here. Eat as much grass as you like.
Giraffe, but Buffalo doesn't have a horn. He's just...very hairy.
  Very hairy! Very hairy!
Only animals with horns live on the plains.
Charge!
Thing on the end of my nose! Charge!
What was that?
The Rhino charging his own horn! Don't mind him!
Oh, dear   the swamp is getting close!
  Which means we'll have less grass.
  Less grass! Less grass!
Hmm, I think I'd better find a different home.
  Maybe the plains are not for me.
  Why not try the waterhole?
  Oh, yes, good idea! Asante, horned animals! Thank you!
  Oh, dear!
Every animal needs a home.
Aw!
  Must find nuts! There we are! Must gather nuts!
  Jambo, Squirrel!
  What are you doing?
  Jambo, Buffalo.
  I'm gathering nuts in case of trouble.
  Trouble?
Well, I'm worried about that swamp.
If that swamp keeps moving,
there won't be any food in Tinga Tinga, except for my nuts.
  Have one.
  Asante! Thank you! That is kind of you.
Can't have animals going hungry!
Very thoughtful of you, Squirrel. Now, good day to you.
And good day to you, Buffalo.
  Elephant, look!
  Oops! Sorry, Buffalo! I was trying to get Hippo!
That's OK, Elephant. I like water. Reminds me of the swamps.
What do you mean, reminds you of the swamps?
Well, Tortoise, the swamps are moving,
so I was wondering if I could make the waterhole my new home.
Karibu, Buffalo. You're welcome to stay here. We can trumpet together.
Toot, toot!
  Come on in, the water's lovely!
  Asante, Elephant. Thank you.
Toot, toot, toot! Go on, Buffalo, you do a trumpet!
Wait, wait, wait a second. Prr, prr, prr, prr...
Yeah, try again, try again!
No, no, no. I can't trumpet like you, Elephant.
But does anyone have some food? I am quite hungry.
Try some pondweed! You'll love pondweed!
Oh, Hippo, thank you, asante.
Ooh, that really is very...pond y and weedy and...yucky!
No, that's not for me at all.
  I think I'd better find another home.
  Oh!
  Poor Buffalo.
Maybe you should try Lion and the big cats.
Lion has a big head of hair like you.
You may feel more at home there.
Good idea, Tortoise. Asante.
  Oh, poor Buffalo. Every animal needs a home.
  Mmm.
  Jambo, Buffalo. How nice to see you.
  Jambo, Your Majesty.
The swamp is rising and I need a new home.
  Well, stay here with us, Buffalo. Karibu, you are welcome!
  Yes, yes!
  Stay, Buffalo!
  Welcome, Buffalo.
In fact, you've come just at the right moment. It's grooming time.
Perhaps you'd join us? You have a wonderful head of hair.
Asante! Thank you very much!
Buffalo, try purring!
Ha ha! Try purring!
Pu, pu, pu...
Pu, pu, pu, pu...
Oh, my! That's not right, is it? Maybe I was just meant to be alone.
Nonsense, Buffalo! Every animal belongs somewhere.
It is nature's way.
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!
What is it?
The swamp, it's moved so much that
the horned animals are trapped! Look!
  Mmm...
  Hello! Can you help us? The swamp is rising and we're trapped!
Quickly, we must go!
  Any suggestions, Tortoise?
  That is a very big swamp, Your Majesty.
I'm afraid I don't know what to do!
  Help! Yes, please!
  We could do with a little help, please!
  Of course, we will!
  But how? What can we do?
  Push back the swamp.
  You can't be serious, Buffalo!
  I am! I can do it! I know I can!
  Huh?
  But how on earth are you going to do it?
  Like this.
Grr! Grr! Grr!
  Anything happen?
  No!
  Not yet.
  Keep going!
  Go on! You can do it, Buffalo!
  Hoo!
  Hoo!
  Ha!
  Ha!
  Hoo!
  Hoo!
  Ha!
  Ha!
  Hoo!
  Hoo!
  Ha!
  Ha!
Tortoise, look! Buffalo is pushing back the swamp!
It's amazing!
You can do it!
  Hoo!
  Hoo!
  Ha!
  Ha!
  Hoo!
  Hoo!
  Still going back!
  Yes, Buffalo! Come on, Buffalo!
  Keep going!
  Yes, Buffalo!
Well done, Buffalo! Well done!
You're a hero, Buffalo! A hero.
And you belong right here with us on the plains.
But I don't have any horns.
I know how to fix that, Buffalo!
  How?
  Something I used to be very good at. Just a minute now.
Over once and over twice.
  Why is Squirrel braiding Buffalo's hair?
  I don't know.
And over once and over twice, got to look nice.
  Why is she braiding?
  What's going on?
Got to look neat, got to look nice. Hand over once, hand over twice.
  Got to look neat, got to look nice!
Oh.... Oh ho!
Wait and see, Elephant! Wait and see! Ha ha!
Hand over once, hand over twice. Got to look neat, got to look nice.
He he!
Going up!
Ta da!
Buffalo, they're probably the biggest horns I've ever seen!
  How do they look?
  Very fine! Very fine!
Asante, Squirrel. Thank you very much.
Now don't move. Let those beautiful new horns dry in the hot sun.
  Ah, looks good!
  What big horns!
Buffalo, listen! The horned animals are going to throw you a big party!
And you are going to look magnificent!
  Buffalo's horns are rock solid!
They'll last for ever and ever.
Ahem!
It gives me great pleasure, Buffalo,
to welcome you to the horned animals.
  Welcome to the plains. Welcome to the plains.
Welcome to the plains!
My new home!
And as Buffalo is the strongest beast with the biggest horns,
he must lead the celebration.
Let's dance the dance of the horns.
Left, right! Left, right!
Left, right! Left, right!
  I've got horns
  Shake your horns
  Horns
  Shake your horns!
And that is why Buffalo has horns!
Shake your horns!
Raise your head, shake your horns!
And Squirrel, with her clever braiding,
well, that's a whole other story.
Shake your horns!
