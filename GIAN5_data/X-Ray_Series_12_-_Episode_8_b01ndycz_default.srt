You're watching X Ray. On the programme tonight: They thought
they'd bought a week's holiday in a caravan, but this woman's made off
with the cash. Andy's grazed his horses in this field for 30 years.
So why are Network Rail trying to stop him? And a jammed cruise
control could have been fatal   but Hello. Welcome to the programme.
I'm here in Barry, finding out what's being done about every
drivers' worst enemy   potholes. First. A lot of families look
forward to a holiday in a caravan. But this year, caravan parks across
the UK are reporting a heartless scam that's ruined the summer for
many. For the Killen family from Swansea, life with five young
children is certainly a challenge! We've got three girls and two boys,
aged ten to one. So it's very busy! And what about your husband? Andy's
at university studying to be a motorcycle engineer. So financially
tight? Yes, it can be. Serena and Andy have never had the money to
take the whole family on holiday. But this year they were really
desperate to get away. With finding out our son has learning
difficulties at the beginning of the year, we thought it would be a
good idea to book a holiday for summer. Where did you want to go?
We wanted somewhere quiet, somewhere where we could walk to
the beach, husband, go fishing with kids. We needed somewhere obviously
quite close to home cos we don't have any transport, we were relying
you can buy all kinds of things. And when she spotted a cheap
caravan break, her hopes of a holiday started to look a lot
brighter! The caravan Serena found was on a site just up the road from
this gorgeous beach   Pendine Sands in Carmarthenshire. Serena could
just imagine the children playing here and enjoying their first ever
it was for �210 for a week Gosh, a good price? Yes. I thought we had a
bargain! This is the woman who was selling the holiday   Jessica Scutt.
She was very keen to clinch the deal, sending Serena helpful emails
about the great beach and facilities at Pendine Sands. Serena
was sold, but kept the holiday a secret from the children, until the
morning of the trip. I was really excited and I was really happy cos
we hadn't been on holiday. I think the beach would be really fun.
were you going do to with mum and dad? Go fishing? Do you like
fishing? Yes. Have you been before? No. What were you going to catch?
fish. The big day finally came and the family couldn't wait to get
down to the caravan. But within minutes or arriving, their holiday
hopes were shattered. Serena still has nightmares about what happened
that day. So this is where you thought you were staying, number
134 Dukes Meadow. What was the arrangement when you got here?
started to unload car, realised caravan didn't look like pictures s.
Jessica Scutt supposed to meet us here at 2pm, no sign of her.
husband went to reception to find out what was going on, discovered
that we'd fallen for a big scam. She looks like a woman who enjoys a
joke, but the cruel trick she played on Serena left the family
devastated. The real owner, Phil Darbyshire, was horrified. Hi Phil,
you know Serena, you've met before. So what was it like when she
arrived here? It was terrible, absolutely. Serena was breaking her
heart in reception because she realised we were all part of a scam.
How do you feel about person that's stolen the pictures of your caravan
to do this? Well they're just lowlifes, they don't see the
consequences of their actions, they don't understand that Serena and
Andrew saved for however long, how much it means to the children, they
just see a few pounds in the bank. What's it like for you, Serena?
Devastating. Even now, it brings it all back. How did the children take
it? They were devastated, I broke my heart to see their little faces,
especially when you have to tell them we're going home With no sign
of Jessica Scutt or the money they'd paid her, the family headed
home. Serena phoned Gumtree. Amazingly, they were already aware
of the scammer. Because they knew all about it on 24th July, our
holiday was on the 30th, nobody had bothered even letting me know, I
could have avoided the whole events of that day. We asked Gumtree why
they hadn't let the family know. They say they thought it was a
matter for the police. So who is Jessica Scutt? Well, she's not
certainly not shy, we've found loads of pictures of her on social
networking sites. But not everyone's her friend. We found
angry messages online, from other people who say they paid her for
holidays which vanished into thin air We tried to track down Jessica
Scutt, who seems to be living in Guildford. Eventually, we did
manage to speak to her on her phone. Now we're sure it was her, but she
denied knowing anything about scamming the Killen family, or
anyone else. We've been talking to the police. They too are on
Jessica's trail. They've already spoken to nine victims of her
unpleasant little scam. So how do you feel about Jessica Scutt?
hope the police catch her and she never gets opportunity to do this
to other families. And what about the future? Hopefully we'll get
over it and go on another holiday as soon as we can afford it. That's
terrible. Jessica Scutt definitely needs to be behind bars. Now if
you've fallen victim this scam, or know anyone else who has, then we
want to hear from you. Our contact details are on the screen now. And
we'll keep you up to date on that police investigation. Still to come
tonight. How a trip to the shops became a terrifying experience for
one BMW driver. And Andy just wants to get to his field, but Network
Rail want to stop him. But before that, time for Lucy to get On The
Case. This is what the brochure promised. But Lyn Wilcox's memories
of her Tunisian holiday are all about the things she left behind.
I've left some very precious items in a hotel room, and I know they've
been handed in, but no one will help me get them back, so please,
Lucy, can you help? Lyn and her family had a great two
weeks abroad in the sun earlier this year. But on the final day,
she left behind her most prized pieces of jewellery luckily, they
were handed in. Crisis averted? Not by a long way. Hi Lucy. Hi Lyn,
tell me all about these bracelets. They were actually given to me by
my husband on the birth of our three children, so great
sentimental value. Tell me how you came to leave them at the hotel?
Unfortunately, we were a little bit late getting changed. I took
everything out of the safe, put the items the camera, the three
bracelets, on the shelf above the safe. On the way to the airport
then we realised. Of course, we were in such a rush I left them
there. So when you realised on the coach that you'd left the jewellery
in the hotel, what did you do? First of all, panicked. I could
actually picture the items I knew exactly where they were, on the
shelf above the safe. So, as soon as we got to the airport, the first
thing my husband did was go and have a chat with the courier who
took us there. He got on his mobile phone. He managed to get through to
the manager who confirmed who went to look for the items and then
confirmed the items were there. They had been handed in. The
courier then jokingly said, "When are you coming back?" So we all
looked at each other, and said "What do you mean when are we
coming back?" He said that might be the easiest way you can get these
items back. The bracelets are worth �1,500. As soon as Lyn got home she
contacted her tour operator, Thomas Cook, to get them returned. Several
phone calls and emails later and the company said they couldn't help.
It was our fault we'd left the items there, yes, we admitted that,
so I contacted the hotel manager, spoke to the gentleman there. He
said, "Oh, we've got the items, but we can't return them to you. We can
only pass them back to the Thomas Cook rep in the hotel." Thomas Cook
then said they wouldn't take responsibility. I said "Can I
arrange for a courier?" The hotel manager refused. He wouldn't
release the items. So even though Lyn was willing to sort out her own
courier to have her bracelets flown the 1,300 miles back from Tunisia
to Britain the hotel just wouldn't help. So Thomas Cook were telling
you to go to the hotel, the hotel were telling you to go to Thomas
Cook and they wouldn't even let you use your own courier. You must be
at your wit's end. I was starting to tear my hair out by now. It's
really frustrating because I know there are simple ways of getting
the items back, either Thomas Cook could do it, or the couriers could
do it for us, but every time I think I've found a way I'm hitting
a brick wall. So Lyn, what would you like me to do? Please, Lucy,
can you help get the items back as soon as possible. I'm on the case.
Right, well, what happened to Lyn could probably happen to any of us
losing your valuables on a holiday. To sort it out, we wrote straight
to her tour operator, Thomas Cook. After we spoke to them they managed
to get one of their own staff who was holidaying at the same Tunisian
resort to pick up Lyn's jewellery and bring it home for her. Hi Lucy,
I've got my bracelets back. Thank you very much for what you've done.
I don't think these bracelets are ever going to leave this country
again. Thank you. And that's another case closed. Nice work.
Remember if you've struggling to get something sorted, you can give
us a call now or send us an e mail. Remember to leave a daytime phone
number so we can start working for you straightaway. And if you've got
anything to say about tonight's stories, join us on Twitter.
remember that freezing winter we had two years ago when potholes
appeared all over our roads? Back then dozens of you complained to us
about the state of the roads and the damage it was doing to your
cars. Jeff Norman had to pay nearly �600 to repair his car after
driving over a pothole. He made a claim against Vale of Glamorgan
Council, writing them over 200 letters and threatening them with
legal action. Eventually, two years on, they've finally paid out. So
what's the situation here in the Vale now? Are there still potholes
around? Hello., Askew, have you noticed lots of potholes on the
road? Yes. It is bad. Is it a big problem, pot holes? It is terrible.
I buckled one of my wheels a couple of months ago. It is not very good.
And it is very expensive. It put the tracking out. You have to go
and get that sorted out. The tyres wear out quicker. It is slow
getting it sorted out. I assume additional funding was given and it
has not been forthcoming. Well, sounds like there's plenty left to
do, but it does look like the Vale of Glamorgan is now taking the
problem seriously. They've launched something called The Big Fill.
What's this all about? This is the launch of a year long campaign.
This is on the back of public feedback that we have had in
response to the number of potholes that are about. The public will
call you if there is a pothole on your road and you will come out and
sort them out. Yes, we will be Rees    visiting these roads over the
coming man sad addressing the concerns. If someone has potholes
on the road in the Vale of Glamorgan, you will come and sort
them out? Yes, indeed. Now, if you buy a BMW, it's often because of
the brand's reputation for safe and reliable cars. But Rachel's been
meeting customers with reason to doubt that reputation. I've never
known such a horrific experience and I don't ever want anyone else
having to go through what we've been through. Nicole Davies from
Caerwys in Flintshire is a busy mum. She spends most of her days looking
after her younger son, Cameron. Always on the go. Going to and from
school and different places, playgroups. Non stop! Having a safe
and reliable car is important to Nicole so two years ago she decided
to buy a BMW. With a growing family we bought it when I was pregnant
with Cameron so we needed lots of boot space but more than anything
it was the safety and the reliability. My husband wanted a
safe family car. Nicole drove her BMW for two years without a problem
until one day in June, when it took on a life of its own. It was an
ordinary summer's day when Nicole and her son set off for a drive.
took the opportunity just Cameron and me to go on a bigger shopping
trip a bit further, 25 miles away. It was lovely and quiet on the
motorway so I used the cruise control, which I don't always do.
Nicole set the speed at 50mph as she travelled along the North Wales
Expressway. Then as we approached the turn off I went to apply the
brake which is what usually disengages the cruise control.
Nothing happened. I was madly hitting the brake. Nicole tried
desperately to stop the car. approaching the roundabout at about
55mph, just sheer panic. How can this be happening? How am I going
to stop this car without killing both of us? Fearful for her son's
safety, Nicole took drastic action. I had to make a sharp left turn
into a string of bollards which is what slowed the car down then hit a
lamppost which then spun the car round back on itself and it came to
rest against two cars and that's when the engine finally cut out.
opened the door and jumped out to get Cameron out because I thought
the car was on fire. Miraculously Nicole and Cameron were unhurt.
was afterwards I couldn't sleep. I don't know why you do it to
yourself but you replay it in your mind, hundreds of times and what
could have happened and that's when it really hits home how close it
was to us not being here anymore. Nicole reported the accident to BMW,
thinking they'd investigate. So what did BMW say to you? They
shrugged it off. It's not for us to investigate. Someone else should
tell us if they think there's a manufacturing fault, we're not
aware of anything so we'll just log your call is as far as I got.
might think Nicole's experience was an isolated incident, a one off.
Well, you'd be wrong. Just like Nicole, Richard Brindle thought a
BMW would be the safest way for his young family to travel. In 2007,
they set off on holiday to Edinburgh. The motorway was fairly
quiet so I decided to use my cruise control. Everything was fine until
a car pulled out in front of him and his cruise control jammed. I
tried to deactivate it with the brake then I was hitting the stalk
to deactivate it on the steering column. As Richard's BMW was racing
towards the car ahead, he tried to pull over. Luckily at the last
minute this gap opened up and I managed to squeeze through the gap
but the back end of my car got quite badly smashed up. Considering
the damage to the car and nobody was injured and you think what
could have happened, we were quite fortunate to get away fairly
lightly. BMW told Richard they would inspect the car, but only if
he paid for it. He decided to check online to see if others had
complained   and was shocked by what he found. He discovered lots
of similar complaints and asked other unhappy BMW drivers to
contact him. Ever since then over the last five years there's been a
steady stream of people contacting us wanting to know information.
despite all that, Richard can't get BMW to take his concerns seriously.
So BMW then were just totally disinterested? That's it, they're a
major brand and certainly got money to investigate the problem. You
would have thought they wouldn't need too many complaints, even one
should be enough to look into the problem. So that's two BMW drivers
and a whole host of cruise control complaints online. The evidence
suggests there may be an issue with some of their cars, so why aren't
BMW taking it seriously? Well, not much joy from BMW. They say they
don't have any 'outstanding issues' with the cruise control on their
cars. Vehicle safety is of 'paramount importance' to them, and
Tim Shallcross is a leading expert on car safety. Why aren't BMW
taking this more seriously? It's a great shame they're not. The fact
is cruise control systems have had problems in the past. There's even
a case going on in America at the moment with Ford recalling 100,000
of their vehicles. I would emphasise that's only in America.
Not here in the UK. These things can go wrong, and really BMW need
to pay more attention to the concerns of their customers, and if
there's something like this, whether it turns out to be the
cruise control system or a sticking accelerator, they need to look at
it, find out what it i so people aren't so worried about using them
in the future. Where does this leave Nicole? Well, sadly she
hasn't got very many places to go. In theory she could go to the
government organisation that is responsible for vehicle safety in
this country. That's VOSA. They run the MOT system, sadly far too often
they side with the manufacturer in these issues and we really have no
good organisation with teeth to represent the motorist in this
country or even at European level. Now BMW have told Nicole they'll
only reassess the car, if her insurer requests it. Is that fair?
It's not really adequate. The insurance company didn't buy the
car, Nicole did, and it's up to BMW to respond to her concerns. Now,
would you believe there are nearly 1,200 rail crossings in Wales.
We're all familiar with the bigger ones with barriers and lights. But
some of the smaller ones are much less obvious. Rhod's been to meet
one man who's fighting for the Millard the Milk is a familiar
sight on the streets of Treorchy. For 42 years, Andy was the milkman
here. Just like his grandfather and father before him.. His love of
horses began when a family friend taught him to ride. He used to come
and pick me up from school. I was a little dut of a thing, probably
eight or nine years of age, and he would come and pick me up and put
me on the back and we would ride up through the streets together and
he'd take me home. From then on I was horses mad. Andy's been walking
his horses through these streets to get from his stables to the same
small patch of land where they've grazed for decades. A lot's changed
in that time. But one thing that hasn't is that after using the
roads, his horses have always had to cross a railway line to get to
the field. But four years ago, Network Rail told him to stop.
said they weren't happy with me crossing the line and I was
trespassing, and they didn't want me to cross the line, but of course
I had nowhere else to put the horses. The railway's been here 150
years. Old photos through the decades show some sort of crossing,
long before Andy first started to use the four acres of boggy field
in the nineteen seventies.    1970s. Then it was part of bigger parcel
of land rented by a clothing firm called Polikoffs. One of the bosses
for Polikoff's at the time, one of the managers or directors, and he
said to me, yes, it'll be all right. We'll work out something with the
milk. So if you give them free milk, you' have the field. Well, not
actually free but he just wanted something off. They weren't stupid,
were they? No, but I kept the horses over the field there, as the
years went by I just occupied the field. I stayed there. Fast forward
to 1986, and Ynyswen station was built at the exact point where Andy
had already been crossing for almost a decade. So now, to get to
his field, Andy had to go around the platform as well as crossing
the track. The rail company seemed happy for the arrangement to
continue   they even replaced the old gates across the track with a
new one. They gave me the key. They put an actual wooden crossing there,
so I could cross the horses, so everything was fine... It's a
straight section of track and Andy says he's never had any problems
crossing the line, even though five trains an hour pass through. But
four years ago that all changed. Network Rail told Andy he was
trespassing and they expected him to stop. Here we are, safely across
and just coming into the field now, and I'll be able to leave them go
to have a gallop. Do you think you've got a right to cross this
line and access your field? Yes, definitely. I think surely after
all this time they must have known I'm crossing the line, especially
as they put in a gate and a crossing in for me. Surely, that's
admitting that I've got the right to cross the line. All of a sudden
they change their minds and say no, you can't cross there any more.
why exactly would Network Rail want to stop Andy crossing the line to
get to this field especially after he's been doing it for so long
without any apparent problems? Well, the company say there's an obvious
public safety issue, pointing out that Andy's horses got on to the
line last year, stopping trains. They also say that the deeds to the
field   which Andy got when he finally had the chance to buy his
field three years ago   don't give him any legal rights to cross the
line. Network Rail say those rights disappeared in the 1990s when an
Andy numerous chances to provide documents showing he has the right
to cross. And that he's failed to come up with any. So if Andy loses
his fight with Network Rail and cannot cross the line any more how
is he going to get his horses to his field? Well, it's not going to
be easy, it seems! Andy, shows me the only other way. And as we find
out, it's much too boggy to cross during large parts of the year. Did
you just say though you lost a welly in here? I lost a pair of
wellies in here. You're joking! It's really deep and you genuinely
cannot see where on earth you're going. It's not fair on the horses.
Come on, let's go back. Have you got both your wellies? Yes, just
about! For Andy this is about more than his right to use a field. He
says he's determined to be able to keep riding with his grand children.
I hope my children and grandchildren will have a right to
use the field and keep horses and carry on. And what would giving up
your horses mean to you? Everything. My whole life would change. It
would take away something I've done all my life. I just don't know what
I'd do without the horses in my life. I've always had horses and I
hope I continue to until the end of my days.. Well, Network Rail aren't
budging on this. They've told us they'll only reconsider Andy's case
is if he can come up with documents showing he has a legal right to
cross. But Andy's told us that the threat
of prosecution won't put him off taking his horses across the line
as he's always done. Well, that's it for this week. Remember we want
to hear from you if there's anything you'd like us to look into.
