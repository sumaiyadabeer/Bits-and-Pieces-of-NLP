Does it prove that money still buys access to British politics? We hear
from a govern Minister, Jim Murphy and Tory backbenchers have. On the
Politics Show Scotland, we'll hear from Labour's new Shadow Scottish
Secretary on how the party aims to persuade voters to back them again.
We'll also try and find out how many questions the people will be
asked in the independence referendum. Could there be a simple
Yes and No campaign? Or will there be a second question keeping the
union but offering more powers   so called devolution max? It would
make eminent sense. I thought Labour would be behind that. And it
is an industry which is worth billions and growing, but why does
the Scottish tourist industry feel I do not understand why the private
office did not say. Why they did not go to somebody else and see
they are worried about it. There is a feeling of a lack of joined up
thinking. We do not know what was and was not there. That is why we
have got the Cabinet Secretary looking into it. We must wait until
after that report has been produced. The cat let Liam Fox get away with
cultivating links with other regimes. The fact that it might be
a passable thing does not mean that he was not doing it, some of the

health service thousands of pounds a year. The government has
announced it is giving almost ï¿½1 billion to charity groups to
provide short breaks for carers. The money will be used to fund
after school clubs for young carers and social activities to prevent
people becoming lonely or isolated. There are around 650,000 carers in
Scotland. The money will benefit around 3500 of them.
A new survey suggests almost three quarters of Scots think Holyrood
should have more say over how the country is run than the Westminster
government. The Scottish Social Attitudes Survey also found a
higher level of satisfaction with the Scottish Government. Speaking
this morning, Alex Salmond said the figures were encouraging. In the
survey published today, support for the Scottish government is running
at 62%, three times the support for trust in the United Kingdom
Government. For the first time, TV viewers are

Scotland shareholders. It's in a BBC Scotland documentary tomorrow,

Thanks, Rob. They have dubbed themselves Team
Scotland. The latest Labour reshuffle has seen 13 of the
party's Scottish MPs made spokesmen or women on a variety of subjects
from climate change to benefits. But what will they actually stand
for? The party's chief strategist Douglas Alexander has called on his
colleagues to find a story which reconnects with the Scottish people.
He also pointed out only one in eight Scots voted for Labour in
May's Holyrood election. So they seem to be a party in search of a
vision, but what vision? Christine Labour has taken significant steps
this week to help of the electoral recovery north of Scotland. Our job
is to be a better expression of a politics of social justice and that
sense of possibility. North of the border, after giving a prang speech
on where the party went franc    a franc speech on where the party
went wrong in May, a new vision was unveiled. But a former First
Minister warns of critical obstacles of the Labour Party must
overcome before its members are capable of working together to
produce the new vision necessary for recovery. Holyrood and
Westminster must have equal status and that is not happening. There
are too many tensions, too many people still at Westminster who
want to lecture those at Edinburgh. We have got to start singing off
the same hymn sheet. The success of the SNP is that there has a small
number working closely together. are not articulating clearly the
core values they claim to stand for, according to one commentator.
us what a more equal Scotland will look like. Talk about life chances,
about the good things you have done and not done. That agenda is
something Labour have never fleshed out in the 12 years of the Scottish
Parliament. Some politicians have tried, but there has never been one
of mantra. A of the Labour Party can overcome its internal
differences, Henry McLeish says his top priority should come up with a
credible alternative but to independence. We have to look at
the issue of the independence referendum. Not just to oppose that
and have a unionist Alliance, but to have an alternative. For me, it
could be Devolution Max. But come the party deliver these
alternatives and time for an independence referendum and
outmanoeuvre the SNP to return to I am joined now by the newly
promoted Shadow Scottish Secretary, Margaret Curran. Congratulations on
your promotion. What was a job description you were given?
priority is about the future of Scotland. Henry McLeish had a point
when he said that me    that any need unity, parity with Westminster.
Our priority is the people of Scotland. Talk about the lessons.
You talk about parity between MPs and MSPs. As a former MSP, there
was undoubtedly tensions. It is sometimes at the nature of change.
But looking forward, there is unity of purpose. We have learned a lot
of lessons. Westminster has a deep understanding and commitment to
Holyrood. But in the Westminster team, we have a very strong group
of talented MPs, your MPs with new ideas and the new energy who want
to co ordinate and focus that in the best interest of Scotland.
There will be at some point and new leader of the Labour Party in
Scotland, what will be your relationship with whoever that is?
I know them well, so I am sure it will be a good relationship. They
will be directing policy in Scotland. Where it is a reserved
issue. I can guarantee you that when you focus on the people that
represent you and when you focus on Scotland, and we have a lot of
thinking to do about the future of Scotland, then it we will gel.
will that work on policies like higher education for the Labour
Party in Westminster will have one due    one opinion. We have been
living with death of policies for many years.    a different policies.
If you are a voter, you are hearing one message across the United
Kingdom, a separate message in Scotland and your perception might
be that you are a divided party, you do not have a common purpose.
do not think that is true. We are a variety of nations with different
government. We have a devolved nations addressing their own issues.
Scottish education has always been different from English education.
This is just perhaps a more dramatic version of that. But the
Labour Party is a big party, we are a big movement of the big
challenges and we can accommodate back quite easily. Is it just the
Labour Party in Scotland which seems to be struggling to tell
voters a story which will attract them, or the Labour Party across
the UK? There are lessons to try and understand the big challenges
in the United Kingdom. The biggest challenge that Scotland faces is
the economic challenge that is taking across the world. We had
80,000 young people that are unemployed. That is a major change.
I think that some of the thinking that Ed Miliband is doing is very
interesting. We have to change in Scotland to adapt to the changes.
People in Scotland to talk about changing the party, coming up with
different policies, but we have no details. What has Labour stand for
now? The big challenge facing Labour in the future, what Douglas
was saying the other night is very interesting, it is the big economic
changes that we are facing. We have to face that enormous at this
location    dislocation. Devolution is about that redistribution of
power. It is about empowering people. We have not talked enough
about that. So give us a policy. will not give you a list of
policies. One that would do. will challenge on of employment in
Scotland. When we face economic dislocation, we will make sure that
we fulfil Labour's historic mission. When a Europe of the survey
published today, people trust the Scottish government more than their
UK government. That is as a result of what the SNP has done. When you
look at that survey, over many years, when devolution could first
given, people welcome that very strongly. I think the service part
of a bigger story. There are possibly two questions want
independence.    on independence. We have got a lot of deep thinking
to do and I want to be part of that regeneration of the party.
Developing policies for the future. We need to make sure that we don't
just get into a straitjacket. The questions in Scotland are too big
for that. My team in the UK will be contributing to that bigger debate
is that we need to have about the big challenges Scotland face rather
than talking about this    about the powers of the Scottish
government. We need to talk about demographic change, economic change.
That is a conversation we need to have her. Thank you very much
indeed for your time. The Scottish National Party will
gather in Inverness later this week to celebrate their election victory,
but also to discuss how they can win the upcoming independence
referendum. But how many questions will voters be asked to answer? A
simple yes or no to independence, or a second option which would keep
the union but back greater powers for Holyrood   so called Devolution
Remember this question on the last time Scotland was asked to vote in
rare referendum on palace was back in 1997. People were asked if they
wanted a Scottish Parliament. As the results came in, it was clear
that the answer was an overwhelming "yes". The votes cast for "yes",
18,790. It represents 80%. there was also a second question.
The votes cast I agree that a Scottish Parliament should have
tax varying powers, up 16,112. Representing 68.7 % of the ballot
box. Now the people are to be asked again about Scotland's
constitutional future, and again, they could be two questions. This
is what the last minority SNP Government proposed. First, a
greater powers ballot. The Scottish Parliament would, with certain
exceptions, be responsible for all laws, taxes and duties in Scotland.
The exceptions, which would continue to be the responsibility
of the United Kingdom Parliament, our defence and foreign affairs,
financial regulation, monetary policy and the currency. Do you
agree? The second question would But since these proposals were
published, there has been an election and Alex Salmond has a new
majority Government. He is yet to rule on how many questions he
currently prefers. If there is a third option, more powers, then the
likelihood is that that would win, or at least that Scotland would
vote for either independence or more powers, and so the SNP could
come away with at least gaining something from the referendum. It
is an insurance policy for the SNP. But that insures policy raises the
prospect of some conflict campaigning. The SNP are during the
"yes" "yes", others are doing "no" "no", and others St "yes" to more
powers and "no" to independence. But he would those others be?
majority of people, I think many people who vote for the SNP, would
vote for increased devolution but not outright independence. Many
people voting for the Labour Party and probably the other parties, too,
would feel some of it. So I think that no, Yes campaign may not win.
But people would have to know exactly what they were voting for.
The last Holyrood referendum had cross party support. That would not
happen this time. On the constitution, Scotland's politics
remains deeply divided. I am joined now by Ian Davidson, chair of the
Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster, who has just announced
two inquiries into he independence referendum. Also the SNP's Derek
Mackay, Cook represents the backbenchers at Holyrood. Alex
Salmond hinted earlier in the week he would have a second question,
one on for fiscal autonomy or Devolution Max, one of the other
names for it. That will happen, Bridget? I think the Government
remains open minded on the questions that will be put to
Scotland. That will be outlined over the coming period but if there
are multiple questions, what will be clear is that we have a very
positive case for both more powers for the Scottish Government or
independence. But we will be aiming to win the independence. It is only
fair that people know there will be a question on independence, so it
is only fair that you said as much time as possible for people to know
there will be a second question, in case there are those areas
campaigns. How much time will you give people before you announce
what there will be for a second question, and if there will be one?
The First Minister said there would be the referendum in the second
part of the parliamentary term. The Scottish people have given us a
mandate for that. There will be a     plenty of time. There will be a
proper process to ensure that Scotland's voice is probably ahead
and that the polls that we have seen today show that both
independence is very popular and people think that power is rightly
held in Holyrood, the most relevant parliament in dealing with a
Scotland's day to day concerns. Davidson, you have watched these
two inquiries, or your committee has. By, or when this is an issue
that will be dealt with at Holyrood?    why? It is much better
we have separation achieved amicably and that will have to be
done with the UK and Scotland and all of us, whichever the retake,
will want the process to have been as amicable and settled as possible.
That is why. There are two points we want to pursue which we do not
believe are being pursued adequate. How a separation referendum is
actually going to be run. It is clear that at the moment legal
representation for constitutional matters lies with Westminster. That
was decided by the Scottish people when they voted in the referendum.
Wait. That was is guided by the Scottish people when they voted in
the referendum.    that was decided. But things have moved on and it is
clear we are going to have a referendum of some sort. For the
second thing we will pursue is that if we are going to have separation,
people have got to know what they are averaging about. Michael Moore
produced a list of half a dozen items he Bix need to be clarified.
We are asking people in Scotland what additional issues they need to
have clarified. For example... Let's just take that first point.
Which is that it would be an advisory referendum. Westminster
are hardly going to turn around, having had a referendum in Scotland,
and say, tell you what, we do not care what you think. Why should a
referendum simply be advisory? Why don't we take the view that it will
be binding, but Westminster accepts it is a binding referendum? One at
a time. It is important that if we are moving to separation we do it
amicably. I would have thought that having both Westminster and the
Scottish Government clear that it will be a fair referendum with a
fair question, then that is the best way forward. Do you think that
they are trying to park their tanks on your lawn? All the parties in
Westminster are all over the place. Scott learned    the Scottish
National Party has a mandate to hold this referendum. The Scottish
Affairs Committee, it is absolutely irrelevant, it is a sideshow, it is
not a committee made up of Scottish MPs. As we approach... As we
approach the referendum, there has to be a prospectus that will
outline what independence and the other choices would mean. It is the
status quo. But in terms of Mr Davidson's chairmanship of the
committee, I do not think he has too much credibility on harmonious
discussion. Mr Davidson has referred to the SNP as neo fascists.
Unacceptable language on what should be a very good debate on the
future of the country. When the country decided to do this it was
unanimous. There was not a single vote against. Representatives of
all political parties in Scotland were in agreement. What exactly is
the relevant Sardar you are going to ask questions in this inquiry,
Ian Davidson. You have taught about the six points, or what other boys
would you like clarified? The whole point of a qualification is that we
are asking the people of Scotland to tell us what they want clarified.
As a constituency MP I want to see what is going to happen to the
shipyards clarified. Well, we can't cover everything, so... We cannot
even get the language in a constructive tone. It is not
separation, it is independence, it is perfectly normal around the
world, so why the pejorative language? The Poles do suggest that
independence is more popular than the alternatives.    Poles. It
appears it is Mr Davidson who's out of step with the people of Scotland
and his own voters. Derek Mackay it seems to be making quite a good
point, that Labour are not only losing the argument in Scotland but
in the UK? That is why we need a referendum on the question of
separation and we accept that. There will now be a referendum on
separation and what we are saying is that firstly, it has got to be
run properly. Most fans, a snowdrift questions... This is
ridiculous. There will be up an independent body    are there will
be an independent body... It will be a referendum of the highest
standards. Quite a heated debate. When we can use Midge Ure language
and described...    Midge Ure language. Labour leadership, are
you going to stand for any post? Yes, I will be standing as deputy
leader. We had a meeting this morning and it was agreed that I
would go forward. Thank you for your time this morning. When you
think of big money makers in the Scottish economy, what comes to
mind? Foyle, whisky, tourism? Figures showed that more people are
choosing to holiday here. The tourism industry generates ï¿½4
billion a year and employs tens of thousands of people. But despite
its economic importance, many you working the industry do not feel
How to turn spectators into buyers, at this year's Scottish ski and
outdoor show, will be a challenge but it is one the industry is
taking on. New figures reveal between January and June 2011,
domestic visits or staycations, to Scotland, rose by 6%. But there has
been an a % decrease in overseas visits. That is compared to an
increase of 7% across the UK. international visitors have not
come in the amounts we wanted but they are a small part of our
overall tourism market. And if the marketing expenditure is limited,
you focus market expenditure on the bulk of your tourists, who come
from domestic locations. So the big focus for us has got to beat
England, the rest of Scotland. That is where we have the possibility to
make money in a recession. This pub in Perthshire uses a website to
promote itself but despite staycations, business is slow.
has been a difficult year. We have not had much business at all from
Visit Scotland. We put a lot into letting people know we are here. We
try our hardest to work with other businesses in the tourism trade.
One business they work with his Big Tree Campervans. The tourism
industry generates ï¿½4 billion a year and the mobile phone business
is part of that. The owner here believes his sector should receive
more support to help increase turnover. My biggest fear is we
forget some of the emerging markets, camper vans, motor homes,
watersports and active leisure areas, and do not focus on them
enough and really understand what makes those areas tick and do
things with those to bring visitors into the country. In the winter
months, Scottish cities can target the conference market and weekend
breaks but rural areas struggle. If the tourism industry is to thrive,
it needs to ensure that people who make staycations return. We have
seen the beaches, which is great but some of the attractions have
been closed. I would have loved to have had a bit more of the local
fish. You can see that there is a lot of fish being farmed here and
there but you cannot buy it. Scottish ski results will be hoping
for a long, cold and snowy winter to draw in the crowds. The growth
of the staycation is having an impact across the world. It is
challenging but we definitely have a local market that was helping as
well. Due to the general downturn, it is obvious that the tourism
sector is what is suffering. They made more funds available for us to
fight. With the 2012 Olympics approaching, Scotland must compete
with London for its share of the market. The spotlight will be on
the UK but London specifically, but it is on the rest of the UK. There
is a lot of displacement that will take place within the UK, I eat
people who would like to go to London but can't because the rooms
are full.    I mean people... the World Wide economy still wobbly,
the challenge Scotland faces is to hold on to these staycation as and
keep the international tourism on board.
We have a couple of leading businessmen in the tourism industry,
Robin Worsnop, chief executive of Rabbies Small Group Tours, and also
the head of Edinburgh's Tourism Action Group, and the managing
director of Crieff Hydro, Stephen Leckie, who is also the chair of
the Scottish Tourism Forum. Stephen Leckie, give us an idea of how well
Scotland has done in the last season. It seems the UK market is
propping up the industry. The most recent statistics tell us that
Scotland has performed very well this year and what am hearing is
that in central Scotland, that is so. Up north and in rural areas it
is a bit more tricky. In Crieff Hydro we are having a good year and
that is after a significant investment in the last two years.
Robin, things like fuel prices must have an impact on people travelling
up, for example, from the south of England. Yes, it is definitely
having an effect in the roar parts of the country. The central belt is
doing well. I was surprised by the international figures that came out
for the six months of the year because our experience has been
completely the opposite of that and people I have been speaking to have
been doing particularly well in this area. And we did not have the
ash cloud disaster of April hitting us in 2011. We didn't have the
sunshine either. I was very surprised to see these figures.
What have you learned from these international tourists who come
over here. What do they tell you about why they are choosing
Scotland? I believe we have been a national competitive competitor
since the Stirling devalued against the euro. Scotland has iconic
assets. The Edinburgh festivals, the Highlands, the scenery. And the
friendliness of the people here is a superb thing that visitors want
to enjoy. Stephen Leckie, there seems to be some sense that lots of
folk who work in the tourism industry think they do not get the
attention they deserve. Is that your Gazette didn't    perception?
A joint this industry 30 years ago and even then there was this chap
but tourism is one of the key drivers for economic growth in
Scotland. Tourism has devolved and that is good news. We have a very
able Visit Scotland marketing Scotland and that makes Scotland
the envy of the rest of the world for having a large publicly funded
marketing body and then it is for the Private Business, people like
me and Robin, to work that out and persuade people to come to Scotland.
Her attitudes then changed to Visit Scotland, because for a long time
the debate was that people who worked in the tourism sector did
not feel it delivered for them? Has that changed? Perhaps there are
some really high expectations of what Visit Scotland can achieve for
the industry. In some terms it is measured at ï¿½4 billion. Other
measurements are ï¿½11.5 billion. It cannot be expected to deliver
everything for the industry itself. I believe that those who are doing
well have invested heavily in their customer experience and in their
product, and they are getting the word of mouth or what is commonly
referred to as the world of mouth, driving their business forward
today. Stephen Leckie, how do you hold on to these staycations,
because the minute the economy goes up, people will think, I tell you
what, I would rather go and see the sunshine? In Crieff Hydro, it is
not just about giving customers the bed space and food but many other
things in our result, persuading them that Crieff Hydro is the Eric
Joyce in Scotland to keep coming back to. So is that focusing on
service? It is about high quality, value for money, Investment back
into the product and the staff, having Chris Tapp, happy staff, who
want to look after our customers.     having the good staff. A lot of
people have complaints about service. They do, but I think that
is often people with in Scotland who have a very high expectation.
When you look at surveys for people who visit the country, they show
