Hello, I'm Chris Packham and this is Hands On Nature,
your practical guide to the best wildlife locations across the UK.
And today we're going to be wet and wild, both out at sea and inland, as we explore our waterways.
And I've got to tell you, they're amongst the best places to find some our most exciting wildlife.
I'll be checking out Northern Ireland's charismatic bird life.
Gorgeous, I mean, look at them!
Why don't they make cuddly cormorant toys?
Look at what Janet Sumner discovers in a Welsh river.
We're looking at the evidence of a four foot long sea monster.
There it is, look. Oh, it's there.
And Mike Dilger finds a ghostly bird that patrols a Yorkshire canal.
This is Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, the largest sea inlet in the British Isles,
and the stats about this place are amazing.
Get this   every day 350 million gallons of sea water rush in and out here,
and it's one of the richest marine environments anywhere in Europe.
More than 2,000 species of plants and animals have been discovered here.
But it's the creatures that live above the waterline that I've come to see and one of the best times
Strangford Lough is beautiful, wild and rugged
and it's a drowned ice age landscape to boot.
These small hilly islands have a special name.
They're called drumlins and they were made when the ice age ended
and the sea levels rose.
Local folklore has it that there are 365 of them,
one for every day of the year.
I haven't been counting them properly but there has got to be at least, hmm...
80, 85 islands out there, which is pretty impressive.
But you don't have to stand here on the land looking at them.
David Thompson knows this place like the back of his hand.
Just the man to show me the highlights, including one special place called Bird Island.
You can see it from boat trips onto the lough, though landing isn't normally allowed.
Dave, the lough's vast, isn't it?
And it seems to have its own complement of communities. Its own little world, if you like.
It is. It's a huge sea lough,
almost landlocked, apart from these constricted narrows out into the Irish Sea.
  150 square kilometres in area.
  Massive.
  It's massive, and I think we worked out
there's 180 kilometres of shoreline when you add it all together.
  It's so rich   lots of plankton, lots of fish.
  Lots.
And vast numbers of birds. That's quite a show of cormorants.
That's brilliant. Isn't it fantastic?
They go up to 400 pair of cormorants here. One of the biggest colonies...
I sense we're cormorant fans alike?
Absolutely, I just love these creatures.
Brilliant. Full of character.
We don't have that aversity to eating a few fish.
No, not at all.
No aversity to watching them vomit up that fish to feed their youngsters.
That's a delightful practice, don't you think?
Course it is. Punk rock birds, cormorants   I love them.
These pre historic looking creatures are found all over the UK
but it's their superb ability in catching fish that often brings them into conflict with anglers.
Today, though, I'm going to get really close to them by helping David with a bit of survey work.
These are big, healthy chaps.
Yeah, they're really good strong youngsters.
Look at the mouth!
This bird's mouth is opened to the size of a mug.
No wonder they can swallow such massive fish, it's a superb adaptation.
Catch something big, get it down, digest it.
Gorgeous. Look at them!
Why don't they make cuddly cormorant toys?
Seriously.
Gorgeous little things.
Look, this is what they're eating.
  His dinner.
  Oh, that's nice.
Look, there's some very young young here.
They've just hatched.
A day old, two days at the most.
  Oh, my goodness me!
  Blind.
No feathers. Looking like reptiles.
  And a clutch of eggs?
  Yes.
They're doing well.
Look at these guys here. Oh!
That's fantastic.
Oh, look at you!
You wouldn't, would you?
Oh, you would!
This one's still got his egg tooth. That little white thing.
How about that for nest material?
Stolen from children!
Yes, they're wicked creatures!
Gorgeous little things.
  Wonderful.
  Aren't they brilliant?
Oh, they're just superb.
At the southern tip of Strangford Lough
is the National Trust nature reserve at Killard Point
and in June it's just carpeted with flowers.
A feast for the eyes.
  Look at that.
  Beautiful.
  A piece of paradise.
Absolutely. Where else would you find this?
Just about unique, really.
  This kidney vetch is bright yellow.
  There's a sea of it.
There were some spectacular wild flowers
but sometimes the really lovely ones aren't always the most colourful.
  Oh, wow.
  You nearly knelt on that. I nearly knelt on that.
You nearly knelt on that.
If I had knelt on that,
  you'd have had to beat me!
  You'd have hated yourself for a week.
  Frog orchid.
  You're absolutely right, frog orchid.
  Now that is a monster.
  They're good specimens here, aren't they?
Are you not used to seeing them so tall and lush?
No, on the chalk where I come from, they're stumpy little things,
but that's in its prime.
Very healthy. Doing well.
Called a frog orchid because it's frog coloured
and the flowers are said,
or WERE said by the Victorian namers, to resemble frogs.
  Do you see a frog?
  Not unless it's been run over by a truck!
But it's a beautiful plant.
Yeah, it's gorgeous.
But in the autumn, Strangford Lough changes again,
echoing to the sound of an entire species of bird on the move.
This is THE place to witness the migration
of tens upon tens of thousands of Brent geese.
There's plenty of truth in the old adage
that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,
especially when it comes to getting to know your goose. Look at this.
It's a little star.
These Brents might come from the Arctic regions of Canada
but they're very certainly not Canada geese.
They're a distinct species and you can tell the two apart easily.
The Brents here are much smaller.
Look, they're the size of a duck.
And they have that small blunt beak
and they lack a very characteristic white facial panel.
Super little thing.
They might be small but these are remarkable creatures making an astonishing journey.
The entire world population of these light bellied Brent geese
leave their Arctic breeding grounds to head for the lough.
It's a 3,000 mile journey that leaves them on the brink of exhaustion.
The Wildfowl and Wetland Reserve at Castle Espie is the best place to see them.
The question for Brent goose expert John McCullough
is what makes this place so attractive for them.
The reason is food. That's all they're interested in when they arrive here.
We have huge swathes of a thing called eel grass.
They're coming to feed on this, as they've come through a huge journey
and they want to settle with us in the winter and just eat.
When's the best time to come and see the whole 30,000 doing their stuff?
The best time to come is October. The month of October.
You can see them from August onwards but October is the maximum time
when most of the birds have gathered and come in and settled down.
But you do have some birds which have satellite tracking on?
Hi tech low tech fusion. The low tech fusion bit of it is that we keep these on with knicker elastic.
So you have a transmitter on the back of a little goose that costs us a fortune,
yet we put it on with knicker elastic and glue.
Robo goose! State of the art knicker elastic.
Where are they now, then?
We caught them in Iceland in May of this year.
We followed them into the Arctic and now they're on their way back.
What a bird, what a story!
And you can follow their fortunes on the BBC's Supergoose website.
One of the best things about watching Brent geese here
is that you can visit the WWT reserve at Castle Espie.
They've got a great captive collection, birds from all around the world,
some of them even hand tame, like these nenes here,
and an excellent tea room, a prerequisite of any good birding trip out.
You're watching Hands On Nature, your practical guide to the best wildlife locations across the UK.
Coming up in a minute, Mike Dilger does some do it yourself pond dipping...
  Can I have a go with a tennis racket?
  Yes.
I fancy a comedy moment!
But first, water plays an incredibly important role in the shaping of our landscape,
particularly when it's draining down to the sea.
Now, the River Wye is the fifh longest in the UK,
it rises in Wales and eventually goes on to form part of the border between Wales and England.
It's largely unpolluted and an incredible area for nature conservation.
No wonder, then, that Janet Sumner couldn't wait to get her waders on
and explore a particularly beautiful stretch near Builth Wells.
This is part of an 11 mile stretch of the Wye Valley
that I plan to explore.
The river passes through some of the most beautiful and unspoilt scenery you can imagine.
It's a river famed for the diversity of its wildlife,
including some of our most celebrated rare and endangered fish species.
Some of the Wye's most magnificent natural features
are where its tributaries tumble into the river, cutting deep into the rocks.
This is what I mean   huge waterfalls,
which is fine for us to come and admire,
but it also has an effect on the wildlife.
Now, just imagine that you're an Atlantic salmon coming back up this river to spawn.
You've got to make it up this waterfall, so only the biggest and the bravest get to the top.
It's no wonder that the salmon in this river are famed for their size.
If you come in autumn, you might see these amazing fish in action.
They'll have travelled 6,000 miles from the Atlantic
and this is the last exhausting part of their journey.
But even in spring, you can find salmon here in the Wye
and some other lesser known but equally fascinating fish
making their own amazing migratory journeys.
My guide to the river is local environmentalist, Simon Evans.
Hi, Simon, is anything biting today?
I had one on earlier and I almost had it to the bank to show you, but it fell off at the last moment.
  I don't believe that!
  It's the fisherman's tale every single time.
It's funny, isn't it, because everybody knows that birds migrate
but other creatures migrate as well.
Absolutely. In this river there are fish that come from many, many thousands of miles away
just to come back to spawn.
Apparently there's an amazing mystery fish in this river that we know very, very little about?
Well, I hope to be able to show you one soon. I'm just looking for them at the moment.
It's a strange fish that's actually a species of herring
but here we are, 110 miles from the sea, and I'm fishing for herring.
  Got him!
  Oh, have you got one?
  Here we go.
Gosh, it's really bending the rod down.
Oh, it's fantastic colours.
  Now, what does it remind you of?
  Well, it looks like a sea fish
which is bizarre because we're in a river.
Do you want to know what the mystery fish is? This is a twaite shad.
  A shad?
  A twaite shad.
  It's really bright and glittery.
The scales are designed to be reflective so they reflect the colour of whatever's there.
It's taking on the green of your jacket.
No one knows anything about these fish. There's only four rivers
in the UK that have decent runs of these.
And the shad are only here for six weeks of the year.
The adults come up for a month, they spawn, the eggs hatch, two weeks later they're gone.
So I've been really, really lucky to see this, haven't I?
You've come at just the right time. Shall we let him go?
It'll just take a couple of seconds just to get his breath back
and then he'll disappear back into the depths.
There he goes.
  There he goes.
  Wow!
Now, you don't have to be a fisherman to see fish or anythingelse in the water
but here's a couple of things that will help you.
These are polarising sunglasses. They really cut down on the glare from the surface.
And if you want to take photographs, get yourself a polarising filter for your camera.
Now, our cameraman, Trevor, is going to show you how well these work.
Are you ready, Trevor? That's with the polariser out.
And this is with the polariser in. And what a difference it makes.
I'm now at the lair of what is, believe me, a real monster fish
and here for just a few weeks in May and June.
If we put our glasses on...
Yeah, use my glasses.
..can you see, there's a sort of scrape up here
where there are no stones, it's been taken back to sand, and then a pile of stones behind.
And if I just show you
one of the stones.
So this is a fish nest?
Yeah, and that's the sort of size of stones that they're shifting.
No way! Are you telling me that a fish moved something of that size?
This is the spawning site of a sea lamprey.
When they spawn, they clamp onto the stones,
they lift up and then they twist back down and drop it back down.
You can still see the scrapers,
the double raspers where the lamprey's picked it up.
  The fish moved all those stones?
  That pile of stones there have all been moved by two fish.
But the thing about these fish, to shift these stones, these are big fish.
These are 4ft long, as thick as your arm, and they're predators.
  Are they in the water right now?
  They are. They're probably...
The two that spawned this redd are probably in this pool behind us.
Before you get too worried, don't worry, like the shad, they don't feed in fresh water.
Can you believe that? Right here in the middle of the Wye Valley,
we're looking at the evidence of a 4ft long sea monster!
The next day from that very bridge, we spotted that the lamprey were back.
Our cameraman captured this amazing footage.
The lamprey clamp their mouths to the rocks
to move them out of the way.
They're creating a safe nest.
And they thrash their tails to make a dip in the river bed
in which to lay their eggs.
You don't need an underwater camera to watch them.
This is the view from the bridge.
Out at sea, these 4ft long fish are ferocious parasites,
clamping their lips onto prey
and literally sucking the innards out of them.
It's an extraordinary animal.
Now, another way to get close to fish in the Wye is to get your net out.
What we've found is a tiny baby version
of the Wye's most famous resident   the salmon.
Oh, wow, no, there he is!
He's young of the year. He's hatched out of the gravel just a couple of weeks ago.
How do you know he's a salmon?
He's got giant petrel fins   those yellow fins on the side  
and he uses them to hold him on the bottom.
Fingers crossed, in five years' time he'll be coming back up this river,
4ft long, 30lb, leaping up the waterfalls,
having been on a trip all the way out to Greenland.
There's just one more creature that I'm hoping to see.
He's a quirky little chap with an unusual mannerism.
If you sit quietly by the river you might be lucky enough to see a dipper.
They love this fast flowing shallow water
with lots of exposed boulders for them to use as perches.
Just needs a bit of patience.
There's one. Right now.
On the boulders.
They've got this funny habit of bobbing up and down when they perch.
He's doing it now. It's a bit like they're doing tiny curtsies,
and nobody knows why they do that.
It's one of the great unsolved mysteries of the bird world.
Birds of prey dip their heads down to get a better sighting
on small mammals, but he's not doing that
because he's fishing for insects in the water.
He could be communicating with other dippers but I don't see any more around today.
So the mystery remains.
A great way to explore the river is by boat and you can hire one
from Hay on Wye and other towns along the river.
In the past, many of our waterways got a bad press for being dirty
and polluted, and in some cases that criticism was richly deserved.
But over the last 25 years, we've gone a long way to improving our water quality
and where human disturbance has been kept to a minimum, wildife has been able to creep back in.
Now, Mike Dilger discovered just such a place near Pocklington in the North of England.
The Pocklington Canal might be only ten miles long,
but what it lacks in length,
it makes up for in its sheer diversity,
both above and below the water.
And to top it all, exploring it couldn't be easier or more relaxing.
And if you get to chance to take a boat journey on a canal like this,
I'd advise you to grab it with both hands.
There's no better way to get a canal's eye view
of all the water birds, plants, and lovely insects.
These yellow pond lilies that are fringing the edges of the canal
are just lovely plants.
There's a few species quite similar, actually.
You can tell this one, the yellow pond lily, because it smells of brandy
and the big leaves are perfect launch pads
for the red eye damselfly.
Each male protects his own lily pad and says, "Get off, it's mine."
You can find 13 species of dragonfly and damselfly on the canal.
In fact, in just a few hours I counted eight, which is pretty good,
including this banded demoiselle.
Just watch it waiting for passing prey.
Gotcha! A protein packed meal of a midge.
I tell you what, dragonfly watching doesn't get better than this.
I'm watching Britain's biggest dragonfly, the emperor.
The female is curling her abdomen round
and laying eggs underneath the weed.
Superb.
One activity that appeals to the child in us all is a spot of pond dipping.
And to show me how it's done, I've enlisted the help of expert pond dippers Geoff and Roma Oxford.
Gosh, this is fantastic catch.
  I think there are lots of very young...
  Hello, chaps.
  Hi, there.
  Ah, hello.
  How's it going?
  Fine.
  It's really interesting.
We've found quite a lot of different aquatic invertebrates.
You've done phenomenally well already.
In terms of tools, this white tray's wonderful
because you can see everything that's inside. What about nets?
  This is a professional one...
  This is very specific to pond dipping?
..and it's really rather expensive.
But if you're desperate and you don't want to use a professional pond net or an expensive one,
an old Wimbledon racket and a pair of your mum's tights.
Maybe I'll give that a go later!
But what you pull out of the canal can be amazing.
  The thing that immediately strikes me is this little critter here.
  Leech. Yes.
They're fantastic, aren't they? The way they writhe through the water.
People get the heebie jeebies about leeches,
thinking they're going to suck their blood,
but virtually all of the leeches you get in freshwater
eat nothing larger than snails or snail eggs.
Further downstream, there's even more to find.
  Can I have a go with the tennis racket?
  You certainly can, yes.
I fancy a comedy moment! And if you have a go with that, we'll see what we can get.
I love it when the DIY techniques work as well as something you spent a lot of money on.
  Yes, that's right.
  Well, yes.
  Look at that!
What you catch in a canal depends on where you do your dipping.
And in this stretch, which is oxygenated,
you'll find different creatures like these freshwater shrimps.
If you're in any doubt about what you've got,
its worth taking a field guide along to help you out with any identification issues.
The water in this canal is really clear
and there's a good stretch that doesn't have any boat traffic,
so you've got a great chance of seeing eels...
..roach and dace...
..and even freshwater mussels,
which can lay a staggering 200,000 eggs each year.
Nick Askew has got one of the best jobs in the whole of Yorkshire  
studying an animal that's right at the top of everyone's must see list.
And the grassland that fringes the canal is a great place to start looking for them.
A great evening, Nick, but what are our chances of seeing the barn owls tonight?
Sadly, over the last century numbers have fallen from about 12,000 pairs in the '30s
to about 4,000 pairs at present.
But this is one of the few areas where numbers have remained quite stable.
In fact, they've been increasing over recent years
so you've got a really good chance of seeing a barn owl round here.
But to see barn owls, a little stealth is required
and in a flat landscape like this, you need a bit of height.
This is absolutely ideal habitat. You can see all the rough grass we've got
on the edges of the canal and in the fields.
  So this is perfect barn owl habitat, yeah.
  So, best habitat.
  What's the best time?
  Dusk is very good if you're not an early riser.
If you are, then dawn's good as well.
Especially during the summer, May to September.
They're nice, big obvious birds. Just keep your eyes open.
They've got a lot of things right here. The rough grassland is full of prey,
and watch out for these curious dog kennel like structures.
These are barn owl boxes.
  There it is, look! It's there.
  Yeah. I see it.
  Fantastic!
  That's it.
Oh, wonderful view!
  I think you're right.
  What unbelievable timing!
  Here it comes.
  Just floated straight into shot.
That's lovely.
This is classic barn owl behaviour, flying about 10ft off the ground
whilst listening and watching for prey.
He's off to hunt to find some food for his chicks, isn't he?
He's got a lot of voles to catch.
By now things were moving on, so it was time to help Nick with his research into barn owls chicks.
OK, so let's see...
  what we have here.
  Oh, just fantastic.
There's so much down as well.
Yeah, it's just falling off now. You can see all the quill dust as well.
You can see that beautiful heart shaped face.
We're going to fit them with rings.
It's worth bearing in mind that Nick is licensed to touch barn owls and nobody else can.
  So even though it's Hands On Nature, it's hands definitely off barn owls.
  Unless you have a licence.
One thing you can get your hands on is these.
  Yeah.
  The old barn owl pellets. Most people think these are a kind of faeces but they're not.
No, these are vomit. These are the regurgitated remains...
  In a word!
  These are regurgitated remains of their prey.
If we just put them in the water it helps break them up.
There we go. These are just full of fur and bones and they tell us exactly what they've been eating.
  I've got a skull here.
  Oh, great.
  So that's the upper skull as we look at it.
And if I just turn it over, can you see those two rows of teeth there?
Can't believe how well we did today.
We've seen adults flying around, we've seen chicks in a nest box,
we've analysed their pellet remains. I think we've had a pretty good day.
There's more information on our website...
Well, sadly, that's about it for today, but I hope we've given you a few ideas
of waterways that you can't wait to explore.
Let's face it, your sofa's nice but this is so much better.
That's it for this edition of Hands On Nature.
'Next time, I'll be catching up with one of our favourite animals.'
Look, there's another one!
I've got to try to control my excitement.
'And Samjida O'Connell is in East Anglia...'
Di di dee, do do do, do dee you.
