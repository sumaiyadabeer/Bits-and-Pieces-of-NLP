Badge Quest!
Shh! Hello, chuggers.
Today you're going to be trying for your quiet badge.
  OK, Vee.
  Yeah! It's Badge Quest, way hay!
Shhh, Wilson. Your quiet badge.
This might be hard for Wilson.
I can keep my bumper zipped...
Like this!
  There are times when it's important to be quiet.
  Like at night.
You get three lives but if you make a sound you lose one.
Got it, Vee.
Off you go. And I don't want to hear a peep out of you all day.
Wow! That's what I call fast!
VEE COUGHS I heard that Koko.
That's one life gone.
Frostini!
Ice cream, ice cream Tootsie fruitsie ice cream...
  Wilson, shh.
  Oh, bumpers!
Honking horns, it's Action...
Oops.
We have arrived at the next stop on your safari tour.
What animals live here?
but she is very shy.
  Wow! I want to see the baby.
  Shh.
Sorry!
To have any hope, you will all need to hush.
Oh, there she is!
Aw!
You scared her away.
If you make lots of noise, you won't see many things.
But close your eyes and be quiet,
you'll be amazed what that brings.
  Aww.
  I know this is hard for you but you can do it.
Just remember what M'tambo said.
Ha ho hoo, ha hoo hoo
Well done, Wilson. You've been quiet for hours.
You see, good things come to those who wait...quietly!
Now Vee says it's time to go home.
You can all speak now. Congratulations, trainees,
you've earned your quiet badges.
  Train tastic!
  That was a tough one, wasn't it, Wilson?
It's OK, Vee said we could talk.
Actually, I quite like not speaking.
Really?
Yeah, I learned a lot today.
If you make lots of noise you won't see many things,
but close your eyes and be quiet, you'll be amazed what that brings.
Goodnight, chuggers. Sweet dreams.
