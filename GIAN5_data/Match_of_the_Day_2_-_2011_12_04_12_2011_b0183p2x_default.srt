yesterday.    highlights. Robbie, it's over. Nobody wants to see you
dance any more. The public have Hello, everybody. Match of the Day
2 is here to place a full stop on your weekend of football, all
travelled to Molineux, with new manager Martin O'Neill's eyes
peeled. The eyes were also firmly focused at Goodison, as Everton
hosted Stoke. And which super strike has the look of a winner?
We've November's Goal of the Month. We'll also show you all 25 goals
from yesterday. And we should point out that you can now watch the show
in HD, although you may need sunglasses given Robbie's teeth.
Off we go then, to Molineux. Martin O'Neill is Sunderland's new manager,
and his brief will be to get the black back    the Black Cats to
winning ways. They managed only two victories this season. Eric Black
takes charge today with the new man watching in the wings. They
travelled to Molineux to face a waltz side desperate for three
points. They were even top for one brief stage in August, but since
then they've lost it and have won just once. The Premier League can
be a cruel mistress. Steve Wilson Ellis Bauer did to the wish of it
Sunderland fans. Eric Black is in charge for one game only but Martin
O'Neill is in the stands before starting tomorrow. Mick McCarthy
can partner Fletcher and Doyle up front. O'Hara and Stephen Hunt
Turner. They have only won one of their last 11 games here. Wolves,

Sunderland start under Martin O'Neill next week on the back of
another defeat. Welcome back to the Premier League, Martin. Mr O'Neill
takes over at Sunderland tomorrow and has a tough job on. The Black
Cats looked likely winners but the game turned in a matter of seconds,
following Hennessey's penalty save. Stephen Fletcher then scored and
netted again for the winner. Fabulous match. He insisted it
didn't touch him. When it came to us I thought they'd send him off. I
didn't see the card. He done his hamstring. If it wasn't a penalty
then the goal they deserved, because it was a great save it.
missed the penalty, that was the turning point. The confidence then
goes with the team that has and one that many games this season. It
just drained as of energy and it became hard after that. The few
weeks ago they will have heard my comments at the Swansea game but
today I thought our supporters were wonderful. They stuck with the team,
with me, there were no dissenting voices. They deserve the huge pat
on the back for their efforts to date. Martin O'Neill moves in on
Monday with good players to build on. It's a really strong squad. The
work ethic is fantastic, they are a good bunch of lads. They are
desperate to do well. Globally Marton will get a bit of confidence
back into them. I'm sure he will galvanise them and get them going.
What happens to you now, it's a limbo situation? I'll just have to
see what happens. I leave the club Another really enjoyable game.
was very poor at the start, technically, a lot of mistakes, but
it got better as the game went on. There was a crazy minute, centred
around one decision. Great play from Sunderland's leading up to the
out, he made Larsson go down too easy. It was outside the box, not a
penalty. That was a dive with bells on. Such a shame. Larsson has
generally been brilliant this season. He let himself badly down.
And a second time in a row. Not a terrible penalty. Not just a game
changing moment, possibly, a seasoned changing moment. Well held
up by Fletcher. A great header. Poor defending from Brown. The
momentum was with them. Fletcher You can measure loads of things,
shots on target. Possession. Momentum is so important. When
Hennessey saved the penalty. The winning goal was eight minutes
great finishing by Fletcher. I think that came away from his
shoulder. A brilliant decision. Because he leant towards it, it
looked like a penalty, most penalties would give it. But you
shouldn't, and the goalkeeper thinks it is a penalty as well. The
most important thing is the referee, unless you know it is a penalty,
you cannot give it, he made the right decision. Referees get a lot
of stick. 15 people watching that, we all said, hand ball. He deserves
all the credit. This will never catch on, being so
positive for the referee's! If Martin O'Neill, the statistics
speak for themselves when it comes to this man. When he takes it
further over, he generally improves them. I was fortunate to play for
him at Leicester. Aston Villa, he proves at every club he can do it
well. At some clubs he has money. Martin O'Neill took his seat as
manager elect. All the best players weren't available. However,
goalkeeper, that saved by Westwood is top class. For me, I think, if
you are looking at players who can play left back, left wing, anywhere
on the left, Richardson it is as good as there is. Defending. And he
scores a great goal. Sessegnon has looked better and better. Work
ethic is one of the most important things. Bendtner. Heskey. Joe Hart.
His captain, Cattermole. Martin O'Neill, it is all about his team
and when you let your team down, he won't accept that. Martin O'Neill
will be disappointed. The big thing is, he has an order around him,
players respect him. Robbie, you played under Martin O'Neill. And
Steve Bruce. What will be the difference at the training ground?
One of the big things at Birmingham is you are only as good as your
strikers. He hasn't got any, basically. Martin O'Neill will need
a couple of centre forwards in. Steve Bruce was more hands on it
the training ground. Martin will come out for five minutes. Everyone
lifts their game, it is amazing, the Europe of that man. Both
fantastic managers. Bruce will get another job. As he walked away from
the stand, the expectation rose. We saw the evidence. He comes in and
improves. What is the realistic The top half of the table, that is
what you would expect from Martin O'Neill. Don't get relegated, as
simple as that. Get a structure, don't give away silly goals. And
build, going forward. Right then. With Martin O'Neill in mind, you
can see his first game in charge of Sunderland next Sunday on Match Of
The Day 2. The Black Cats are at home against Blackburn. There's
also Stoke against Spurs. And next week we're on BBC One at

A reminder that Goal Of The Month, and all the action from yesterday
is still to come. But on we go to our second Barclays Premier League
game of today, with a trip to Often slow to start, Everton look
like they are gathering pace. Last week they want at Bolton. Following
a previous home success against Wolves. Stoat celebrated a
milestone in their history, qualifying for the last 32 in the
Europa League. Unbeaten. But they have struggled in the League,
losing their last four. No doubt they will be looking for success
top scorer is a teenager who today makes only his second start for the
commitment, Stoke have played nine games more than Everton. Tony Pulis
has shuffled his pack with a Woodgate coming in, Shotton
replacing Pennant on the right. Delap is out. Whitehead takes his
place in midfield. One week on from the tragic death
of Gary Speed, his father Roger joins several of his former Everton
team mate at Goodison Park to take part in one minutes applause in
Gary Speed's passing, his memory reflected at Goodison Park, as well
as making 65 appearances in the 90s, Everton was the team that Gary
Speed supported as a boy. Fantastic reception for Roger Hooke I'm sure
would have watched his son play at Goodison Park many times. You can
see the expressions on the faces, how heart felt the memories of Gary
Speed remain. Tony Pulis, a fellow apart from Peter Crouch behind the
ball. A bit a space for Coleman on the right. It was too high. He
should have done better. The best chance of the game so far. It did
Baines. Shotton could be in there from Stoke. Out for a corner. Not
the best piece of control from Baines. Shotton probably had a bit
more time than he realised. The Stoke corner taken by Etherington,
headed by Bilyaletdinov as far as Whitehead. It took a deflection
right in front of the goalkeeper, Robert Huth will claim it. He
scored against Everton two seasons ago it in a draw at    up at
Goodison. Robert Huth made sure it ended up in the bottom half of the
net. Bilyaletdinov. Hibbert on the righthand side. Fellaini. Coleman's
pass. This was a chance, Sorensen the linesman's flag is raised.
Robert Huth, does he get a little tug on Vellios as they run for that
ball? Maybe there wasn't so much in it really.
Peter Crouch is in a round the back of Hibbert. Etherington. That is
out for a corner. He is a fall back naturally. Flicked on to the front
post, Shotton should have scored. Fellaini felt that he was being
held on to buy Shawcross. A very nice delivery from the corner.
Fellaini was appearing he was being held on to. That bomb from
Shawcross doesn't lead selling macro the whole time.    that arm
from Shawcross doesn't leave there. Tony Pulis, very unhappy
defenders. Peter Crouch at the back this game, to find an equaliser,
they might leave a gap at the back. Cahill, hesitation by Sorensen. The
goalkeeper is staying down, motionless. Sorensen has hardly
moved. Cahill had every right to go for that ball. You can see, his hip
on their head of the Sorensen, the goalkeeper.    on the head.
Cahill, Baines. Vellios didn't get any touch on it. Coleman and
Fellaini battling to keep it alive. Once again, Stoke City getting away.
The goalkeeper Sorensen was dazed. From back challenge from Cahill a
few moments ago. He doesn't look to be 100% right. Keep your eye on the
goalkeeper here. As selling macro and Coleman tried to salvage the
ball. Keep your eye on Sorensen. Begovic will keep goal for the
follows it up. After all of that it's just going to be a goal kick.
Rodwell had the best of the chances chances in one for Everton. Baines
put it in with a lot of pace. First of all Heitinga and maybe even
they qualified for the Europa League knockout stages and today
they beat Everton to move back into the top 10. Robert Huth's first
League goal of the season was the difference ending the run. Those
three points as valuable as any you three points as valuable as any you
will get this season. The it was a classic Forest. We got three points
at Everton, Everton are a good side. We are delighted. Qualifying for
Europe, it was a massive achievement for us as a football
club. The started OK, we'd done OK without really hurting them. We
passed the ball well, be tried to get out, not quick enough for my
liking, then obviously the goal. Very few opportunities all day. We
defended the corner quite well but we were short at the edge of the
box. There seemed to be an awful lot of tussles in the penalty area
in that game. It goes on in every box. I'm not saying it's right or
wrong, am sure there will be people saying they should have been a
penalty here or there. It's going to be our    it's going to be a bit
of carnage every so often. thought the supporters were
terrific. All supporters in football have been great to Gary
Speed. Everybody respected him. It was great that his dad was here
today. In some way, if it is a send up, hopefully it was a good
one today. I thought Everton Football Club did brilliant. A
great football club, do it that    traditional, old fashioned English
football club. The people who organised it today, it was
fantastic and a great response from the crowd. It's hard to think back
seven days ago and how horrible it was, but seven days later and six
days later there was something very uplifting about seeing the entire
football community paid tribute to Gary. And rightly so. I spoke to
his father last night. He can't believe how the football world has
come together to show such a tribute to his boy, Gary. You could
see he said, absolutely amazing. The tears were streaming down his
face. It was a little bit like last week for everything that was said.
It was the Swansea fans saying, we don't want the minutes' silence, we
want a minute of applause. It is the fans that had defined the
mourning. No matter who you supported, the footballing
community in Britain have come together to pay tribute to one of
the biggest legend be seen, in my eyes. And those emotive scenes, it
was really charged. The game got under way. 90 minutes later, plus
half time, Stoke had another win under their belt and absolutely
flying. Yes, they've had a fantastic season. Because they play
generally to their strengths. We all know what their strengths are.
It's because they know how to defend. They know how to work hard.
They know how to organise the team They know how to organise the team
in a powerful way. They Ra powerful team. However, defending. Look at
Howard there. For me, he's getting blocked. I think that is a file.
The ball breaks. He is blocking him, he is backing into him. He is
standing still. He's not moving. That is not a foul. It is. Fellaini,
is this a foul or an assault? is not a fault. Fellaini disagrees
with you. That one is. The referee is spot on, right behind it.
Fellaini is getting more and more frustrated. Here is another one. Is
this a wrestling match? But goodness sake, they knew that
Fellaini was the one danger. That is 50 50. Come on! Is this a nudge
at the back? It's very good defending. Here? It's a nudge.
Eventually the Everton players get a bit fed up with it and that's
what they complain about. I can't understand why he gets infuriated.
Every team does it. I accept it happens all the time. Stoke are
happens all the time. Stoke are particularly good at it. Mark
Hughes said to me, give the centre half a nudge and move away from him.
Everybody does it. But if you aren't playing the ball, you have
to play the ball. It one referee clamps down on it and every day  
mad game he clamps down then you would see it eradicated. They are
mergers. The difference between the two teams was in the tunnel before
they went out on the pitch. Yes. They are the biggest defence you
They are the biggest defence you will ever see. But they're good
defenders. Really impressed with how they work here. He's got six
players in front of him in red and white. What has he got to aim for?
If he plays it in their, their keeper will come out and take it.
He has nothing to a map. Time and time again he went down the line
and put crosses in. It doesn't matter because there are so many
big lads that are very good defenders and want to win the ball.
They do. Everton today, what they're missing, Tim Cahill's goal,
I think the top scorers got three goals. They miss him and Number 10.
But the number 10 have got through this? Nine players. 30 seconds to
go. They wanted that, didn't they? For me, Stoke, they suffered when
they came back from the Europa League games. This one, they came
back and thought, we will have to defend, work hard, close down and
get a clean sheet. That is why Tony Pulis said that was a classics Doug
game. And a classic away performance. You need your keeper
to perform as well. It has to be said, keepers in the Premier League
at the moment, not a weekend goes by it but we are not marvelling at
them. Sorensen today was big, brave, he came for everything. He was
terrific. You look at the defenders they've got. The keeper is also
attacking everything. Is this a penalty? That is a penalty. I think
Sorensen has played his knee. I think that's a penalty. Once again,
he was really brave. He had to go off after because he took a real
hit. The referee, I would argue it was a penalty. The referee cannot
give that unless he is sure. I have to say, I didn't think it was but
you are so visible tonight but I'm going to agree with you and move on.
Everton, no money to spend again. David Moyes has them in the top
half of the table. They deserve some much credit, the way they
battle of wits. I went to the game at Bolton last week and they look
sharp and fit and are playing for their manager. For me, David Moyes
has no money to spend, there's only a matter of time that he can
continue to under achieve. Much of the day has given us this season's
Goal of the Month. We are happy to What a strike from Ryan Taylor!
chance. Milner is charging forward. Silva. Great first touch, even
better second touch. In a side full of stars, Silva shines the
clearance from Begovic. He goes for goal and finds it. Brilliant finish
again. Get it back from Bale. Three minutes will be added on. It is
Lennon for Spurs. He goes all the way, and Lennon scores! Spurs' goal
two up. It's a well taken Persie for Arsenal. It is 2 1. Van
Persie's second of the game up. You can't give van Persie the ball in
that sort of position and expect to run. Adam spotted it. Johnson, good
first touch. Johnson for Liverpool. He scores! Liverpool are in front.
Glen Johnson, once of Chelsea, puts Liverpool in front against the run
Pat Nevin, not as straightforward as most months we have here. What
is your choice? Only wanted to pick Silva but I can't. However, three
goalkeepers, all of them trampling, could not have saved Taylor's goal.
You have to agree with that. Maybe a bit above the others. Taylor's
technique is fantastic. He's got great technique, from free kicks.
That wasn't a free kick, that was a dipping volley. He deserved it.
Good choice. At last they agree on something! All the goals, Golden
moments and scrambles from yesterday. We have Chelsea and
went home happy. This could have been a very different game, had
this been a red Winstead of yellow poor lewes macro. The referee then
gave Chelsea a penalty at the other end, but the Red Hot Tim Krul kept
Frank Lampard out from the spot. The keeper in the post men kept
Sturridge at bay. The same combination at the other end of
water Demba Ba. The slightest of touches from Ryan Taylor went
unnoticed by home fans, but not the referee. A decision, which was to
prove beneficial for Chelsea. Drogba! Chelsea have the lead.
Didier Drogba heads the blues in Chelsea quickly trying to switch
the emphasis. Ramires is in for 2 0. Tim Krul keeps him out. Frank
Lampard didn't take kindly to being substituted. And walking into one I

the right place to keep Chelsea in front on the pitch.    John Kerry.
depressed rates Sturridge. But it at first you don't succeed...
Throughput Torres. He is away from Perch. Is this the chance for
Fernando Torres to score? He gets another opportunity. It is Kalou.
Chelsea have won it now. Chelsea could yet get another goal. It is
Sturridge. Finally he beats Tim Krul. He has worked for that.

of the league. On saying that, they did their best to give Norwich an
early goal for Stobbart and heavy touch and the imposing presence of
Joe Hart saved the blushers of Kompany and to rape. Aguero then
missed this. Only to redeem himself with a toe poke through the eye of
a needle. Alarm bells ringing at the back for Norwich City. It's a

Bolton were down to ten men after Cahill was deemed to be the last
man when he brought down Scott Parker. Jaaskelainen came to the
rescue. Before Brad Friedel got friendly with the ball, to repel
everything that they threw at him. Until Lennon made the break through.
Lennon. Oh yes, Lennon. The second goal comes at last. Assou Ekotto
was unlucky not to win a penalty but Defoe made sure of the points.
Gareth Bale, near post, Defoe was in there. Iford wouldn't have
flattered Spurs. But Jaaskelainen kept it respectable.
Givet has an opportunity. Yakubu. What a very good goal that is. No
wonder he punches the sky. Against a background of dissenting
supporters. Blackburn take the lead through Yakubu. On that towards
Lita. That is a wonderful goal from Swansea. Delivery from Petersen.
The mood around Ewood Park changes have enjoyed that more than his
manager. Swept wide. Routledge has it. A dangerous ball. Smashed in on
the rebound. Swansea pressed the self destruct button. Allen picked
up his second yellow. Can Yakubu kick his nerve, he can! Steve Kean
is indebted to Yakubu for a bad fall of goals. A much needed when.
When Yakubu scores, it is easy to stand on high and condemn that.
Things have deteriorated really badly. They're all screwed up, the
