Previously on The Celebrity Apprentice, Mr Trump decided to switch up the teams.
Brian's away at a concert,
and I'll make a determination next week where Brian's going.
The celebrities were tasked with creating
and shooting a viral video for All Small and Mighty detergent.
On Athena, project manager Melissa Rivers pushed the envelope.
I still like Jesse being scrubbed
  Scrub!
  Action.
But over on KOTU,
project manager Clint Black took a different approach.
We can still do the dirty lingerie if you want to?
We're producing a fantasy of Clint's.
  And then ha, ha, ha, the guy
  off. It's just stupid.
During the editing process, Joan and Clint battled over the video.
If you'll stop talking, I'll tell you what the team does.
I hope we never see each other again when this is over.
In the boardroom, Mr Trump had a shocking verdict to deliver.
The executives all hated both videos.
Clint, Melissa, pick two people to come back into the boardroom.
I'm going to fire two people. Melissa, who are you going to pick?
  Which proved to be a mistake.
  Tionne, you volunteered to come back.
You're fired.
  Never volunteer for execution.
  Then it was KOTU's turn.
  Clint, who are you going to bring back in?
  Khloe and Natalie.
Mr Trump had a question for Khloe.
I noticed last week you missed a task. Tell me where you were?
I have a DUI, and I have to take classes,
so he made me go to the coroner's office.
I hate people that drive under the influence,
and after seeing what happened to Dennis,
I can't sit here and do nothing.
Khloe, you're fired.
There was only one person who had anything to do with their video,
because he was king of the universe.
Ours, there was no question who was going to be fired.
What are you going to do if he doesn't fire Clint, Joan?
I will not work with him again.
  Wow!
  Oh, my God.
Khloe. Khloe's gone?
I was really upset, because Clint is a jackass.
I don't want to spend two more days with Clint Black,
because I had stomach aches the whole time.
And I don't find this fun.
  And I really mean it, I don't give a flying
  He fired Khloe because she went to the morgue last week.
  What?
He said he lost respect for her when she got a DUI.
So he gave her 20,000 to her charity and told her she was fired.
It's my fault, I thought they were safe, it's why I took them in.
  You and I both made the same call.
  And I'm shocked.
I'm going to miss Khloe terribly.
I am vehemently opposed to drunk driving,
but this was not a girl who was taking what she did lightly.
You don't punish someone for trying to change.
That is so shocking.
When he did that to T,
it was the kind of shock where you have to laugh,
because you can't believe it,
  but I wasn't laughing when he did it to Khloe.
  That's why she went to the morgue,
because she's doing what's right to try and make it right.
She's fired because she drove drunk one night a year ago. What is that?
I thought they were safe. And he threw us a curveball.
  Your video did suck, Clint, by the way.
  Thanks, thanks.
Money, money, money, money
Money
Money, money, money, money
Money
Some people got to have it
Hey, Hey, Hey
Some people really need it
Hey, listen to me, y'all
Do thangs, do thangs, do thangs
Bad thangs with it
Dollar bills y'all
Come on, that mean, mean green
Almighty dollar
Don't you know that
Money
Give me a nickel Brother, can you spare a dime?
Money can drive some people out of their minds
No good, no good
Money, money, money, money
Money.
  Good morning.
  Good morning.
Brian, I want you on Athena, and by the way,
you missed SOME boardroom last week.
  That's what I heard.
  Does anyone have any problems with the boardroom?
Joan.
I just was a little disheartened, because I thought
that if a team captain is supposed to be the leader,
and you fail, it should be their fault...
I know, but Khloe wasn't here the previous week,
I hated what she did, and she's got to suffer the consequences.
For me, drunk driving, the worst thing you can do.
But she's getting over it now, and she's becoming such an example.
I hope you're right. Now, maybe, she will really get over it,
cos now she understands its importance. Maybe she sets a good example.
Now, identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in America.
Over 1 billion a year is lost.
With me are Todd and Andrew from LifeLock,
a wonderful company that helps end the problem of identity theft.
You're going to be working with the executives to come up with
a really wonderful campaign. What would you like them to do, Todd?
Your task today is to create
a package and retail store display for LifeLock.
The trick is, LifeLock's a service,
so you must turn the intangible into tangible,
and packaging and presentation are essential.
You'll be judged on brand messaging, originality and overall design.
  Pick your project managers right now.
  What do you think?
  You want to take it?
  I could take it, or you could take it?
  If you want to, you can take it.
  Any experience? Anyone had any problems with theft before?
  No.
  OK. Then I'd love to do it.
  Do you want to do it?
  Sure, why not? I'll do it.
  All right.
I think I'm the only person besides Jesse who hasn't been PM.
That's completely on purpose.
When you do any of these advertising challenges,
it's very subjective, and it kind of depends on what the client wants.
I didn't want to project manage something that I had little control over.
  Joan, who is your team leader?
  Natalie.
  Natalie, good luck.
It's definitely nerve wracking being project manager,
especially after I knew there was a lot of conflict
between Clint and Joan. So, we'll see what happens.
  Melissa, who is your team leader?
  Brian.
  Brian, good luck.
  Thank you.
Last week, I was gone, I had a concert to do.
It took a second to get back into this whole
Celebrity Apprentice phase, after being home for two days.
It took a little coaxing to get out of bed to get ready to go back to work.
George Ross and Ivanka will be my eyes and ears.
The leader of the team that wins will get 20,000 for his or her charity.
OK? Go out, do a great job for LifeLock.
This is us right here, great.
After Trump assigned the task,
we started talking about the concept.
Of course, you want to be a little light on concept
until you've actually talked to the executives.
  Hi there.
  Hello.
  How are you?
  I'm Melissa. Nice to meet you.
  Nice to meet you.
Brian, nice to meet you. I hope and pray that everybody just does their job.
I'm really not the finger pointing, "you're fired," kind of person.
I do not like that kind of confrontation.
If you had to come up with three key words that you feel
best describes the service that you offer, what would they be?
  Certainly protection.
  Confidence, and security.
  So, what you're looking at is that people will come in and purchase it on site?
  Absolutely.
Team Athena had certainly put a lot of thought into
a broad spectrum of questions.
Are you more interested in emphasising the positive aspects of this service,
in terms of the protection and the peace of mind,
or, obviously, you can do a campaign that's very fear based?
I will say Annie seemed be the one that was
driving the questions, and really take the lead.
Brian seemed to sit back and let everybody else engage.
We're looking to you to be innovative, and come back to us
and say, "Todd Davis has been the central part of our campaign.
"Should he be the central part of what you communicate?" We really look to you to tell us.
Thanks, guys, good luck. Very nice to meet you.
As a consumer, you're all part of our target demographic.
In fact, if you look at who's been victims of identity theft,
you would find that some of the most famous people in the world have had incidents.
I'm the only person in the world that doesn't have to
worry about a thing, because nobody would want to be me!
But would you want that kind of humour,
because I think it's a great way to get people to come over.
  You ought to walk away feeling good.
  And fun.
  So, if you can use humour to convey that,
and that you can walk away feeling safe and secure, then we've accomplished it.
  So, I have one last question, do we all get free memberships?
  Of course.
  Clint is stubborn, and he's self centred.
And if it ain't about Clint, it ain't about nothing.
So, it's going to be a frustrating day for me, as usual, but I'm used to that by now.
  I think it has to be...
  What's going to be our theme?
I think it should start out with something funny to get a hook.
Our task was to take LifeLock, which is an identity protection firm,
and create an in store point of sale display for them.
  The graphic that keeps popping into my mind is the safe.
  Right.
Hi, how are you doing?
Good. Hi, I know you're just getting started.
So, I'll just hang out for a little bit.
What if we get, like, a major bodyguard, and we could say,
"you can't afford him 24 hours a day, but you can afford LifeLock."
I really love a safe for your identity.
Does everybody agree that our display needs to have a safe?
  Right.
  I like the safe.
Natalie's greatest challenge is to keep the peace.
She has to balance finally stepping up in this competition with
keeping a harmonious dialogue amongst team members,
who have historically not gotten along in the past.
What if we give them away a little safe?
And that's what the store shopper leaves with, and that has everything
they need to become a member.
So we're going to try and decide on a tagline.
  Whoa, it's a vault, "are you safe?"
  "Are you safe?" Let's do that.
"Protect yourself, your family, and everything you're worth."
I thought it was very dreary. A big stupid safe, all grey. Who cares?
I wanted right away to make it funny,
but I did not want to push that
because I was trying to be a good team player.
I'm going to break you guys up into teams. Joan is going to be in charge of the packages,
and you guys are going to be in charge of the display.
So, you see the display as being the guy.
The display is easy, he's already out there. I know who he was.
I was totally cool with using Todd Davis, the CEO of LifeLock.
Todd has been the face of this advertising from the beginning,
and I assigned the display design to Jesse,
because he does this in his own personal life.
You know, this is just doodling, but a little lock shaped hang.
Your CD is in here, so when you open it up,
that has all your information.
  That's brilliant.
  And verbiage, and all that stuff.
  I may look like a
  but I do a lot of business at mass retail.
I know how this stuff works.
To keep it sustainable, as minimal of packaging item as we can.
As far as the packaging goes,
I think we finally got a concept
just as our graphic designers showed up.
Has anyone looked at the disc to see what kind of images they're letting us use?
Just out of curiosity.
Today, I decided to sit back
and let the more aggressive people say and do what they want to do.
See, for me, I thought we'd have him there.
Well, we've got a picture of him on the disc.
You need the picture of the lock before, so let's get the lock.
I'm just playing it smart by listening.
Hey, you guys got anything with a padlock on it,
one of your gang boxes, or something?
  As long as I do exactly what I'm told, and I do it well.
  Brande?
  Yeah?
  Hold this like this.
  Then I'm going to be fine.
What about "peace of mind, period." "Guaranteed, period."
  It's simple.
  Or just "easy, period?"
I like punctuation in slogans, period.
Where's the beef? Question mark.
I think we're doing really well for time. Jesse and Brande have gone to do errands.
I'm actually already working on the verbiage for inside the pamphlet,
and I don't have to have that done until eight o'clock.
We're sitting in there relaxed, the time management is fantastic. We are well ahead of schedule.
The tagline is now,
"identity secured, peace of mind guaranteed, period."
"Identity secured, period. Peace of mind guaranteed, period."
The wording that we want to put is, "are you safe?" Up here.
And then underneath, "work to protect your good name and everything you're worth."
Herschel and I were heading to Brooklyn to get the display built,
but before we could do that we had to come up
with the graphics that were going to be laid onto the display.
  It looks great. Print it, save it.
  We'll see you guys later.
  We'll be here.
  See you.
The guy at the construction, Clint,
he said he don't have to do anything but make the safe itself.
He's going to make the structure that our graphics will go on.
  Chad, hey.
  Let's go back here.
We make a wall, and then this layer will come out some,
but then we'll have the graphics people make this graphic,
this graphic, and this graphic.
  And then we put these letters on tomorrow morning.
  And that's your display.
  That will be good.
  Why don't we do that?
I'm with team Athena. We are the display construction team.
We've been here since noon, it is now 3.30pm,
and we still don't know what we are building.
Hopefully somebody's on their way, and we can find out
what we have to do between now and when we're supposed to be finished.
Brian, has anybody called the art constructor
to see about timelines or what he's capable of?
  No one has.
  Would you like me to do that?
  Yes.
  Annie is basically trying to absolve herself
of any responsibility.
She just started, you know, laying the ground work
in case it doesn't go over well tomorrow.
  'Derek.'
  Hi, Derek, this is Annie Duke with Athena Corp.
I just wanted to get an idea
what's the latest we can get someone to you
and not feel like we're in a big time crunch?
'I'd say about four o'clock.'
Nobody seems to think this is important.
I'm concerned about time. So, I need to call Jesse, is what I need to do.
  'Uh huh.'
  We need someone to get over
to the place to start the art constructor working,
  or else we're not going to get the thing built in time.
Did I say that we need someone over there by 4pm,
and it's all the way over in Brooklyn.
  'Then we'll just head out.'
  Thank you.
How do you end up with a display if you're not even calling
to find out the timelines and what can be realistically built?
  Can I panic yet?
  No.
If Brian isn't telling people what they have to do then
we won't have half of the requirements.
  Boy, we have a lot of
  to do. I'm telling you,
I'm a little panicky now.
  Don't be panicky.
  Don't panic, we'll be fine.
It kind of seems that you're being relied upon a lot,
for a lot of stuff.
It's good. It makes the day go by fast.
The task for this week was to create packaging
and display for LifeLock.
I started getting a really bad headache,
and I feel like I've got a fever now,
it just got progressively worse,
until I got super nauseous, like I was going to vomit.
  Oh,
Nice to meet you. Aaron, nice to meet you.
I'm Derek, nice to meet you.
  So, we're thinking about doing a stand up.
  We can do whatever.
We're running out of time, but we can do whatever.
  I feel like
  but I can tough it out.
I get kind of pissed when people who work for me are sick,
just because, I guess, I'm selfish and self centred!
So, there's no excuse for me, unless I'm dying.
  Oh, whoops! This is just alcohol?
  It's denatured alcohol.
I don't think it's really hurting our team today that he's sick,
because there's really not much to do today.
  What does that mean?
  The nature is taken out.
What, nature? Alcohol has nature?
I'm having a lot of fun with them
because I'm asking and learning a lot
and teasing them. We're having a lot of fun.
Where's your plug?
He said three way!
This brings me back to high school, when I was in wood shop.
I always had fun in wood shop.
I'm just one of the guys, with bigger boobs and higher heels.
Other than that, I'm just like one of the guys.
I'm really good at screwing nails in. Very good.
Not that I don't love using my brain, of course.
Tell me when we're ready to go.
As soon as I get him started on this pamphlet.
Herschel and Clint had gone to Brooklyn to finish off the display,
and Joan and I, we needed to run and get a couple more supplies.
It's boring. I don't think it's catching a woman's eye.
No. So, we need something just a little bit different.
  I think we should use Herschel.
  Should we use him in our display?
  Yeah.
Natalie is very naive. I mean, half the time I was saying,
"What rock did you come out from under?"
But she was smart enough to step back
and let people that knew more take over.
Clint never would have done that in a million years.
I would add celebrities and add humour.
We can always throw Herschel in there.
I think they're going to say,
"How are you going to use your celebrity?"
You've got four celebrities here.
We thought, "Shall we use our celebrity?"
So then we get all fired up, and decided we want to change it.
  This is Clint.
  'Natalie and I came up with an idea.'
Everything stays as it is, but my face, Natalie's face,
your face, Herschel's face,
looks like we're peeping around from behind it,
but you guys have to agree to it,
because when you come back we have to take your pictures.
My concern is that these guys over here,
who are building this out of wood, this is already a time crunch as is.
Clint, they say we can do them here, all they have to do is attach them.
The other concern is then...
Oh, I'm sorry, we've got a spy in our midst.
  Hang on, let's go in the other room, here.
  Get that spy out of there.
  Clint, you don't want me to talk?
  I do. Will you come with me?
I'm trying to ask a question. They need to know.
I don't want to talk in front of the other team.
I didn't want to talk in front of the other team.
  I'm trying.
  Herschel's breaking down. Go ahead, it's all yours.
Clint just exited, as he always does.
You just want the safe to stay the same as we got it right now.
OK, so that's what I need to tell them.
Clint is always talking on the phone,
he takes it away, so you almost have to follow him.
And when Clint gets upset, he runs off like a little girl.
Clint, you know that's not the way you act.
We're trying to work it out, they want to change,
but we need to listen and put our heads together.
Don't walk away whenever someone is talking.
I see you think, that means you getting upset. That don't bother me.
  No, I'm not. I'm waiting until I can speak.
  Go ahead, speak, Clint.
OK, if we do this new idea, we have to reduce this thing,
by how much they increase it with our heads.
So, we can't leave it as is.
What I'll do is, I'll make this, I'm going to shrink down this LifeLock,
and squeeze in this "are you safe?"
And you're going to get Victor, the graphic designer?
We're going to talk to them. Yeah.
Some things had to be moved around, and I started to become
concerned that all of the elements were going to pull together in time.
And so, there was some anxiety on my part.
We're at 5.30pm.
It's going to get crazy.
This is registering as blank.
Can we e mail it to me? Just so we have it?
We gave the guy the CD which would have all the graphics on it,
and he tries to open it, and it's blank.
We have to have these graphics,
because these graphics are the whole display case.
  Brande.
  'Hey, Brian.'
We need to give you an e mail address to have them
send the logos, because the logos are coming up blank on this CD.
  So, he e mails the graphics.
  We don't have
And it doesn't have Todd's image on it, the CEO of the company.
We've got the logo, the graphic for the logo,
we just didn't get the guy graphic.
  So, we just need the guy.
  You're talking about Todd, the CEO?
  Correct.
  Come in.
You think?
Inhalate, exhalate.
The printer closes at eight. We have to get the files to them by then.
I kept saying, "we're running out of time,"
and what I am getting is, "stop panicking."
But I'm not the project manager.
  We're coming up on six o'clock, we have two
  hours for this.
Just pointing that out.
Annie, of course, has really taken over the room.
so I'm just trying to pull fact after fact,
so we are just over prepared with everything.
Well, that's a really good fact.
  Hey.
  Everybody's so intense here. Nobody even sees you walk in.
  We're just about finished.
  Where's your cover of the CD design?
These are going to go, and they're going to stick on the CD.
This, as you can see, I've got all the verbiage done,
I'm just about done editing it.
I'm looking up all sorts of interesting things about
  what makes a point of purchase design successful.
When I walked into Athena's room I didn't see that much in the way of real creativity.
And this, basically, talks inside about the fact
that 9 million people a year have their identity stolen.
There were a lot of facts and figures, and that's boring.
Identity theft by itself is not.
For a team, you look very relaxed.
You just missed the crisis moment. You came on the downhill slope.
I want everybody to know that I'm panicking. I'm trying to be calm for you.
If we were all panicking, we wouldn't get anything done.
Boys! The boys are back!
Joan, how do you want the brochure to open?
  Do you want it to just fold?
  Is it just the whole picture?
  Then it should open.
  Or it can open up this way.
  What do you think?
I kept saying, "That's really, really, really up to you now."
We can have it like this, or we can have it open like this,
or we can have it open like this.
I don't think she is a really great leader, I think she's very average.
  Smile.
  Smile, Herschel!
Each one has a bubble.
  Little quote?
  Yeah.
"I may lose my voice on tour, but I'll never lose my identity."
Perfect.
Herschel Walker. "As a running back, LifeLock is one front line of defence
"I would never want to go up against."
"The best numbers in my golf life have been..."
  "And hole in one."
  Make it really cutesy.
  Last week I hated Clint.
This week, the both of us knew we had to work together.
"People may steal my jokes, but they'll never steal my identity."
Done!
He's very funny, but he is SO stubborn.
He's not going to change, so just move around him.
  Looks great.
  Cool.
  That's it.
  That's brilliant.
  We''ll send it out.
  Yeah, do it.
  Well, what are we going to do in our last minute?
  I don't know.
Time was up, handing things in to our printer.
We still had until 10 o'clock to go back to Brooklyn
and work on our safe.
Hey, guys, let's go. Call it a night.
Natalie thought time was up for us to quit.
  She didn't think there was much we could do.
  Small team, small but mighty.
I'm going to send this to them.
Yeah, I'll tell them we are going to actually build the lock in 3D.
So, all you have to do is generate the sticker of the dude.
All the lock, and everything, we're going to do here.
I'd love to put some text on that.
If we're going to lay any text over it,
and print it, you guys have to do it there.
  We don't have the technology to do it here.
  I need that.
I want to put some text in there.
  Just something that pops off, so people see that.
  Sending it to the Athena e mail.
  That man has not sent me
  The e mails aren't coming through,
we're not able to get things to the printer.
And eight o'clock was our cut off for getting graphics to the printer to be generated.
Brande, we're not getting those e mails.
  Oh, did you send them to that e mail?
  I did.
  Yes, she said he sent them.
Is there a way to log out of that and log back in?
I did, and it's not there.
  Just for
  have them send it again.
They were trying to send an image to us,
except it was a very large file, and our e mail wasn't taking it.
  You're sending what you have over to Be Squared?
  No.
  They need to.
If it's not there by eight o'clock, we won't have anything on there.
  So, if we have a choice between whatever the
  they have and nothing,
we should do whatever they have. We don't have time.
We told the Jesse to e mail it straight to the printer,
so that we were sure that we had something.
Because, at the end, if we just had a white board, that was going to be really bad.
Jesse, we need to get the sticker.
  Can you just send that over to Steve?
  'We'll send it to Steve.'
  OK, send it now.
  'All right, bye.'
Brian should have been more aware of the deadlines,
and I think that he should have been more on point with the other side of the team.
I think he was too laid back. He didn't start trying to send it to us until 40 minutes to go,
and I doubt that if we had had it we still would have been able to do it.
  Least we can try.
  I understand. I understand that.
I just don't understand why it was so hard
to get him to understand that we had a deadline of eight o'clock.
Long story short, we ran out of time. We hadn't gotten this e mail.
We just barely finished the packaging, so that could actually go to print.
We decided we were going to go to Brooklyn to just check up
to see what Brande and Jesse were doing.
Hello. Jesse.
This whole logo, these are all going to be freestanding, die cut, and up above.
  So, you already sent all of this stuff off?
  I'm making it right now.
Jesse seems to think it's OK, it doesn't look far along to me.
  I got so sick.
  Like, you did?
  Right here. I held it until I got here.
And then, it was just like...
You get there, you find out the man is ill,
running a 100 plus fever, apparently he threw up about eight times.
Well, life or death, all we need is that sticker of Todd Davis and we're cool.
I can give Jesse a pass, because he's sick, I mean, sick,
but there was somebody else there who knew what the deadlines were.
And to have Brande, who is literally just wood floating down the stream,
is a hindrance more than a help.
What's this?
We only heard from Brande when we called her.
There was no proactive problem solving.
Brande's a great worker, but she doesn't initiate.
  Hey, Annie Duke?
  What?
If we have to go to, like, Staples or Kinko's or whatever
and just print it out on some paper and glue stick it on
just to get the message on there, then we do that.
This is such a disaster.
This is such a mess, I don't know if we'll pull it off by the morning.
I don't know what to do about the fact we've nothing written on it.
We just have to fake it.
Oh, there it is! This is amazing!
That just looks awesome.
Oh.
It's tiny. Really tiny.
  I think it looks like
There are so many little details that just aren't right.
It's very hard to look at something that you don't feel is your best work.
This doesn't fit. No, that's way too small, isn't it?
Oh, my God.
There's no remedy for that?
There's no way they can run one larger right now
and get it over here in time, is there?
'Last night we left early.
'If we had went back to Brooklyn we may have caught that little mistake'
that was caught the next morning.
Hey, Natalie, how are you?
Good. We have a little bit of an issue.
  The part where it's our faces, we need that to be bigger.
  The header.
Is it possible to print one that's bigger and we can pick it up?
Head over here, I'll get it right on the printer.
That's fantastic, thank you so much.
  OK, we'll be in touch, guys.
  What time is our presentation?
Let's get right down to it, shall we?
What makes a successful point of purchase display?
How much pressure is on Brian, is a lot. If you're going to be very laid back about the deadlines
then you'd better do your part of it really well.
He has to do an amazing presentation.
Oh, Brian, we're counting on you.
  Just completely sell this
We have questions, we have answers, we have guarantees.
Unfortunately, there have been several mistakes,
Herschel and Natalie now are out, running like crazy people,
getting a larger top to our display.
  Hello, Herschel?
  Hello, there.
  How close are you?
  We're right here.
We're about to come through the elevator in about three seconds.
  Hey!
  Hello, we're back!
Fantastic! Look how much better that looks, bigger.
Of course. We've got one minute left.
Everything looked exactly, if not better, than I could have expected.
I'll even out this top piece here.
I loved our idea, I loved our concept, so once it came together,
the talking part was going to be easy.
Hi, I'm Joan Rivers.
No, I'm Joan Rivers.
No, I'm Joan Rivers.
No, I'm Joan Rivers,
and because of LifeLock, I am going to be the only Joan Rivers.
What we wanted to do is educate America about identity theft
as quickly and simply as we could at a retail level.
We thought we'd have celebrities saying something funny.
People will stop and read funny.
We did a little research and found out that ladies will look as they're walking
for one seventh of a second. Eye contact!
So we did this with very bright colours, yellow and orange.
We then wanted to give them a takeaway brochure. They'll have to take the brochure.
They will then be given their welcome pack,
which I think we have in front of all of you.
It was just OK, the presentation, because I did not do jokes
and I had three people staring at me
making sure I would get in all the points we wanted to get across.
In the nine minutes I have been speaking to you, gentlemen,
there have been over 180 identity thefts.
We need LifeLock.
Nice presentation, thank you very much for the hard work.
We appreciate this.
And I'm still the real Joan Rivers.
But he's trying like hell.
  Let's go take a look at the other team.
  Great.
  Hello.
  Hi.
  Good to see you.
  Please have a seat.
  Let's get started, shall we?
  Please.
What makes a successful point of purchase display?
There are three messages on our display to draw the consumer in.
Now, message number one has to do with intrigue.
Now, here's my man, Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock,
with his Social Security card and his number on display
for the entire world to see, which no one would do.
Now, message two identifies the problem that every three seconds
someone's identity is stolen, but do we stop there? No!
We take it a step further.
'It was not so much about selling these guys their own product.'
They know what that does,
  and I thought that I could wade my way through all the bull
and get them to believe that our display was the best display.
LifeLock is a service,
and a service is not tangible for the consumer,
so it allows the LifeLock service to actually be in their hands.
So as you can see, there is no better way of making the intangible
concept of fraud and identity theft tangible to the consumer
than offering them actual items to concretise the concept.
Any questions?
Nice work, a lot of hard work clearly went into it,
  thank you very much.
  You're welcome.
'Brian did a great job.'
Just seeing the executives' faces
and how they were in awe of everything,
that made me feel confident about the product.
I'm really excited to see who won.
So, Natalie, you think you won?
I don't know, I think it's going to be close.
  You don't like the job they did?
  No, my team was incredible.
  Who was incredible?
  Everybody. We had some issues in the last challenge.
Why aren't you sure you won if your team is so good?
Cos I don't want to jinx us. I can say that I'm really proud of my team,
because I worried about Joan and Clint, how they would get along.
  And?
  They worked so well together. They were very respectful.
I didn't have to do anything or say anything.
Joan, you and Clint weren't getting along and yet your team seems to have done well.
Let's see what happens, but what do you think?
I think Clint is terrific. I think he's stubborn as hell.
Would you now go and see him in concert as opposed to
what you said last week?
If he gave me the tickets.
She's pretty tough. How did you get along with Joan, Clint?
  Just great.
  Good.
Just fantastic.
What did you think of Natalie as a project manager?
Natalie was a great project manager. She involved the team in the brainstorming process,
made us all feel empowered to create.
Joan, how does Natalie stack up relative to other leaders you've had?
On a scale of one to ten, I'd certainly put her a high seven, eight.
  Are you happy with that, Natalie?
  Yeah, this is great.
  High seven or eight is OK?
  I didn't know they felt this positive.
A seven or eight isn't the best.
It's good company.
So, Brian, tell me about your team.
My team did a great job.
Everyone did exactly what they were supposed to do.
  What do you think about that, Brande?
  I think that's true.
Everybody did a great job.
  But Jesse and I were off on our own doing our own thing.
  Why?
Because we had to split up.
Somebody had to go and work on the display case and run errands
and things like that.
Melissa, who was weak in your team?
Then we were divided into two groups.
We really didn't have a clear picture of what was happening with the other group.
All we know is that Jesse threw up seven or eight times.
Seven or eight times?
He was laid out on the floor this morning, before the presentation it was like man down.
And he was still there?
  He was still there doing what he could to make it happen.
  Not like Dennis, taking off?
No, he was there throwing up.
  What was the problem, Jesse, did you have flu or something?
  I got a virus from my daughter.
Feeling better, Jesse?
  I'm good.
  Good.
Ivanka, let me see, what did KOTU do?
KOTU, in terms of comments from the executives,
the positives were that it was a great and original idea,
a great use of celebrities for humour, etc.
Some of the negatives were that
the display units didn't house the packaging,
so if somebody wanted to purchase the product
they would actually have to call a number, go to a different location.
That's a big negative, Natalie?
It's like Natalie Golf Balls, you've got pictures of the nice, wonderful golf balls, whatever you're using,
and you have to go to a totally different part of the store. It's not great.
  Could I see their product?
  Absolutely.
It's incredibly well fabricated, as you can tell.
It's a safe that when you open it up
you have a leaflet that has the celebrity endorsements on it.
  So they really incorporated...
  Looks beautiful.
  What do you think, Brian? What do you think?
  Very nice.
  Brande?
  It's really nice.
  Pretty good, right?
  Yeah.
  George, could I ask you what did the executives think of Athena?
You came up with a lot of good things, for sure,
the presentation was spectacular,
and they thought your display hit all the brand messaging,
and that was very good.
However, having said that, they felt that what you did was pretty much
a spin on what they had already done, and I'm looking at this.
It wasn't as dynamic as the executives wanted.
There wasn't that much creativity involved in what it was that you
ultimately put together.
At the same time I have to say they loved the fact that your product
was for sale on the display. As opposed to your team, Natalie.
You ready?
Who do you think won, Brian?
I don't know.
Well, it wasn't you.
It was KOTU.
So I just want to congratulate you, great job.
They loved your use of celebrity. They loved your imagination.
They thought your team really was superior.
Congratulations, Natalie, as the winning project manager,
20,000 to your favourite charity. What is that?
The Boys & Girls Club of America.
  That's great, have a good time.
  Thank you.
  Go ahead.
Athena, as you know, somebody will be fired.
  All right.
  We've got to watch, we've got to watch.
  OK. Pop the champagne.
  Congratulations.
  Thank you. To us, guys. Good job, everybody.
  This was a team effort.
Melissa's in the boardroom right now, but you know what,
I know she's not going home.
I had dinner with Annie the night before.
Annie said "Brande's got to go, she's stupid,
"Brande is not helping the team, we've got to get rid of Brande,"
"we've got to eliminate her."
  Brande's going.
  Think so?
  Yeah.
  So, Brian, what happened?
We thought that trying to do something completely different
than what they had already done may not have been the best way to go.
After meeting with Todd, I kind of felt like he loved being the guy,
and we talked about using celebrity, we talked about different things.
But we ultimately went with our gut feeling, which was to pretty much
do what they'd been doing.
Did you think they had a celebrity advantage with Joan and with Clint?
Not necessarily.
Jesse, what do you think?
I don't think it was an advantage. Their packaging was better executed.
Better packaging. They loved the celebrity use.
But I would say the packaging was quite a bit better.
George, who would you say was the reason for their defeat? You followed the team.
That's a hard call, I don't want to pin anyone down,
but I did say that they were going to have a problem time wise.
When I looked at it, and I know how much time is involved in putting
one of these things together, and if you don't leave enough time to do it,
it's going to come back and bite you.
So, Annie, would you blame the project manager for that?
I was so concerned about the deadlines,
and every time I brought it up the response I got was, "It's OK."
  From who? From who?
  Mainly from Brian.
It was, "It's OK, we're fine," and "It's not going to be a problem."
  Brian, is that so?
  It is. There were some unfortunate things that happened
and I guess I could have panicked and really tried to push these guys.
George, what do you think of Brian as the project manager?
The project manager was laid back, that was one thing that concerned me.
He's a cool guy. That's Brian, he's a cool guy, he's a laid back guy.
I thought he did a great job except for the time management.
Except for the time. Who was the weak member of your team?
  Let's watch this one. Brande's going.
'Brian. His time management skills were poor.'
Annie is a troublemaker.
Annie is a troublemaker?
She said to me, "I'm taking Brande out." She hasn't mentioned Brande. She's a snake.
So, Melissa, whose fault is it that you lost?
I honestly feel that it falls upon a number of different shoulders.
Anything to do with your shoulders?
I don't think so, because I worked primarily on backing up Annie,
really putting together strong information and working with Brian for the presentation.
No, no, you lost focus.
If you spent a lot of time on presentation, you were not being judged on the presentation.
You were being judged on the messaging and originality.
And so if you spent more time on messaging and originality
you might have ended up with a superior product than you did.
Can I defend myself, completely respectfully?
I could not do anything to help Annie and start editing
until she gave me something finished, so instead of doing nothing,
I went ahead and got into research.
Except that the focus was not on research, the focus...
  No, the focus WAS on research.
  No, it was turning out product.
  I was told to research.
  I understand.
  Oh, stop it, George.
So I feel maybe there was a miscommunication,
  but I feel that criticism was a little unjustified.
  What do you think, Joan?
I think they're out to get Melissa, and Annie is saying nothing
cos she's out... I'm not coming in tomorrow.
  I'm
  out of here too. This is so unfair.
Brande, if you were me, who would you fire?
Well, as far as I saw, everybody did the job they were supposed to do,
so then it falls on the project manager's hands.
Jesse, if you were me, who would you fire?
Probably Brian.
  Melissa, who would you fire?
  This is really hard for me to say.
  I know it is, I know.
  We all like Brian, we all like everybody.
  No, I'll actually say Brande.
  You would say... Why, didn't do anything?
  I think that Brande,
when given a task, gives 100%,
but with the numbers dwindling, I think everybody has to work with more forethought,
and I feel like there's not that extra step, thinking ahead.
Brande, how would you respond?
I give 190%, and when I'm told to do something, I do it...
  And I agree.
  ..and do it with zest,
and my job was to go and work on the display case,
and that is the one thing that they said that they liked.
Annie, how do you feel about Brande?
I would say Brande's an incredibly hard worker and I love her,
but she doesn't stick her neck out, and I think that...
In poker, it's interesting.
You have people who play to last and people who play to win.
Those who play to last, while they might get farther in a tournament, don't make money in the long run.
The people who play to win will have some colossal failures.
But along with that come colossal successes.
Would you not say that you are playing to last?
Not to win, by not stepping up as project manager?
It bothers me, because you are THE dominant personality every time you are on a team,
you're very authoritative.
  Absolutely.
  You're very assertive, except when it counts, putting your neck on the line.
I completely agree with you that it is, 100%, time for me to step up and be project manager.
Brian, your ass is on the line,
and yet you're really laid back. Why?
Well, I think we lost because we didn't have as good an idea.
Now, whose fault that is, I don't know.
We took a different approach. If it's my fault
because I didn't crack the whip on people, then maybe it is my fault.
You know what, Brian? We're going to find out whose fault it is.
I'd like you to pick two people to come back into the boardroom with you. Who are they going to be?
I'll choose Brande and Melissa.
See, they're going after Melissa.
We've heard from all of them Brande is the weak one,
and they're going to take it out on Melissa.
That's how I feel.
Don't make her the scapegoat!
This girl is such a conniver.
We didn't know that Annie had been talking to Joan about
what was going on with their team.
I'm just so angry, I'm out of here. Truly out of here.
We know now that mother hen is going to protect her chick.
I'll sit outside. They're going to come in here, yes?
All right, go outside.
The other two, go, have a good time at Trump Tower.
Brian, you and your group come back in a few minutes, thank you.
  I'm not going anywhere, but...
  I understand.
  After I have been told she despises Brande...
  Understood.
..and you don't stand up and say it!
My reaction was shock and FURY.
Fury at myself, because I had totally disliked Annie the minute I met her.
I love you, I love you, I love you.
This is disgusting.
This is a snake.
I'll be sitting right outside.
  You OK?
  I just feel...
  I understand.
  No, you don't understand.
You should have spoken up, I am sorry. You should have spoken up.
When you tell me privately how bad Brande is, and then you don't...
  I said it!
  Oh, Annie, you didn't!
I said exactly what I said I was going to do.
It was very wishy washy, it's not right.
You can't be so strong in private, and...
Joan, I completely threw her under the bus.
Joan is so protective of her daughter,
and, honestly, I think overly so.
She felt I didn't defend Melissa or lay into Brande enough.
  Well, I apologise. I...
  I don't want to hear apologies!
Why didn't you say what you said to me to them?
I think it's a miscommunication in terms of what the poker analogy is.
That's a strong statement for someone who plays my game.
  Melissa's the one who's not going to come out.
  I don't think so.
  He loves Brande.
I think Melissa is totally safe.
I'm just telling you, if Melissa goes and Brande stays, I go with her.
I don't care what it blows and how it blows.
  'Amanda, let them in.'
  Yes, sir.
Sit down, please. Brian, right here.
So, Brian, you're not that surprised that you lost, are you?
No, I thought with the time constrictions that we had,
we didn't have the product we wanted.
It wasn't really any fault of ours,
  but, again...
  Well, the concept was your fault.
The concept was our fault.
Melissa, the reason you lost?
Erm, I think we had a lot of problems from the get go.
I think Annie, as usual, attempted to take over the room and dominate with her ideas.
Are you surprised that Brian brought you back into the boardroom?
  Me, personally?
  Yes.
  Yes.
Brian, why did you bring Melissa back?
Well, you told me I had to bring two.
Wasn't necessarily cos I thought Melissa did a bad job.
Of these two, who should be fired?
I can't fire anybody, I'm not like you.
You're nicer than me. I think you're a great guy.
I think you're a nice guy and you don't like the idea of firing people, and that's OK.
  Brande?
  Yes.
  What do you have to say?
Erm...well, honestly, I don't think Brian wants to be here any more.
Is that true, Brian?
Well, this is tough to do.
  It's tough for everybody.
  You're right.
You're not the only one. For everybody here it's tough. It's tough for Joan.
Joan's a little bit older than you and me and everybody.
  Not me.
  Not George!
Come to think of it, probably not George.
But you went away for a concert and you came back and seem to have lost your energy
or your desire to win at this point.
It wasn't necessarily to win,
it's just there's SO many other things that are going on with me right now.
Brian, have you had enough?
In some ways.
It's hard for you to go through with this now, right?
It can be difficult. It's just you're dealing with a lot of different things.
  You get beat up a bit, it's called life.
  You start wading through the bull
In any event, it's very interesting, Brian,
cos as project manager and as somebody that I have a lot of respect for,
and I love your voice, I think it's fantastic
and you're going to do very well, but you did lose that certain drive
  that you had strongly at the beginning.
  I know.
All right, Brian, you're fired, go.
Thank you...very much. Thank you.
Thank you.
Love you, George.
Bye now.
I didn't love the boardroom too much, nobody does,
it's kind of like being a six year old in the principal's office.
'Every time you go in you don't know what's going to happen,
'but I think that if you look at who's responsible for the loss,'
I think that he fired the right person because I was the leader.
  Hello.
  What did I tell you?
I thought it was...see!
So it was Brian?
  So that's it, Brian's gone?
  That's it, Brian's gone.
  I told you, Joan!
I was very relieved to see Melissa walk back in,
cos Annie just left Melissa out to dry.
Annie is totally two faced.
Annie is a manipulator,
and you suddenly realise this is such a snake in your midst.
  Amanda, bring 'em back in.
  Yes, sir.
  PHONE RINGS Herschel, Herschel, get the phone.
  Quick!
Hello?
Hi, Mr Trump would like to see you all back in the boardroom now.
Thank you. He wants to see us back in the boardroom.
Uh oh, we're all getting fired!
Into the boardroom.
We thought, "Uh oh, something really is up here."
'And I couldn't wait to get back in to find out what.'
Sit down, please.
I want to congratulate all of you for making it to the final eight.
You've been through a lot.
You've worked hard.
It's a lot of work, it really is, it's gruelling,
and you're all strong and you're all smart and you're all tough.
I called you back in because your next task starts right now.
'What? We were all packed to go.'
And we were tired and we thought,
"What is happening here?"
'I have never worked so hard in my life. This is just crazy.'
There's nothing more challenging than raising money in this dreadful economy.
But that's what you have to do.
Your next task is to go out and hold a fashion show
and jewellery auction.
My daughter Ivanka's a very special person,
and she's designed a jewellery line which is doing very, very well,
and you will be selecting the jewellery for your auctions from her collection.
You'll be holding your auction at the Fashion Institute Of Technology which is a real winner of a place.
Now, you're going to choose models,
you're going to choose what the models are going to be wearing,
and you'll be choosing the jewellery. You're choosing everything.
You'll need to call all of your rich friends to come down and bid on the jewellery,
and I'll have some people there as well.
One member of each team will be the auctioneer.
Now, who is going to be your project manager?
  Annie, are you going to be project manager?
  Happily so.
'It was starting to look like I was avoiding being project manager, but I specifically wanted'
to make sure I was project managing a fundraising task,
which was very important to me strategically.
We were talking and we were saying Herschel at this point.
Well, I'd like to recommend somebody.
Who would you like to recommend?
I think I'd recommend Joan!
Of course, Joan, the risk is that you lose and maybe you get fired
because you have a better chance as a project manager,
but the beauty is the winning project manager in this case
could win a tremendous amount of money for your charity. So are you OK being project manager?
  Absolutely.
  I'm going to crush you, Joan.
'I will kill to win, cos Annie is totally two faced.
'She bluffs, she lies.'
That's all what you do in poker. She's not an honourable person.
So, my beautiful Joan, and Annie, let's see what happens.
OK, make it a really great show.
I'll be in the audience to see what you've come up with, go. Thank you.
Guys, everybody sit down. OK, here's what I'd like.
Jesse, I need cool brochures for our pieces.
  Why don't we make a preview brochure?
  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
  That's number one.
So we went to the war room and the first thing I did,
I assigned tasks, which is something that people haven't been
smart about, and as a leader that's what I'm supposed to do.
Now, in terms of picking the pieces of jewellery,
so Melissa's going to pick jewellery.
I love dealing with jewellery.
My mum runs a very, very successful jewellery company.
I, in the last few years, have been brought into the company,
so I thought, "OK, this is right up my alley."
  Melissa's going to pick jewellery.
  And I can handle picking clothes to go with jewellery too.
  Well, erm...
  Cos that should be all the same.
  Brande's going to be the head of that.
  Cos I think you know the most about beautiful women.
'This is kinda like my forte, I know how TO DO this.'
And Annie said, "Brande's going to really be in charge of the clothes." OK...cool.
It's my business, but you run with that, ladies.
  Who's going to call the modelling agency?
  I'll call.
  Why don't you just let me do that, you're going to have a lot to do.
  OK. We are so winning this thing.
You think?
'When I heard what the task was going to be I was SO excited.'
This is right up my alley.
Yeah, if you want to e mail right now. Perfect.
Thanks, you too. Bye.
There's only ten models, he's sending them all to us right now
so we can look at them and choose, and then we get first pick.
Oh, you are just rocking out. Check you out.
Thank you. This is my alley right here.
For me, I know how to do things with fashion and jewellery,
'that's my thing.'
Go ahead and pool all your most fabulous size two and four evening gowns.
We'll be there at noon. Thanks.
I'm going to look at the models.
OK, Annie, so I just called and asked Sylvia to pool all of her evening gowns.
How did you do that?
That's amazing!
That's my specialty, connections!
That is good.
Thank you!
On the last task, Annie was frustrated with Brande.
  You are kicking ass today.
  You're right.
  You're just stepping up to the plate.
She's not said one nice thing about her.
"She's not strong enough.
"She doesn't work enough. She's annoying..."
And next thing I know those two are like...
What you're doing   calling people ahead, getting stuff set aside and everything is so smart,
  and I just want to thank you for it.
  Of course, baby! You really were there for me.
I'm really shocked at this change of events with Annie,
cos I thought Annie and I worked really well together.
I feel so stabbed in the back, it's unbelievable. Unbelievable!
  Brande, by the way, has been kicking ass.
  This is going to be fun.
  I'm going to buy this
  victory for us, dude.
So let's just talk about what our chores are going to be
and then we'll all get busy calling.
Natalie, you can go alone to pick the jewellery.
And I want to get the nicest, cheapest stuff. That's our goal?
Yeah.
I picked Natalie to go and choose the jewellery
cos I wanted Natalie to feel like she's part of it
and that's she's not just an athlete, she's still very feminine,
which she is, and she's straight  
which for a golfer is very unusual.
So let her go.
Clint, you're auctioneer, is that correct?
Yeah. I've done auctions, I can bleed people.
OK. This is a fundraiser.
Annie, who is opposite me as project manager.
  She claims she has 40...
  She can bring in 40? I don't believe that.
Annie is a manipulator.
Annie would spit on the ground and drown her mother in it
if it gave her one step forward in her life.
She is...she's not a nice person.
What do you think you could do, Natalie?
20 25 grand.
  What do you think, Clint?
  I may be able to get up to 25 or 30.
  And you think...
I know I got 40 right now.
That's 105,000 right there.
I thought it was really important that we had a goal number, cos this was a fundraiser
and we were going up against what
I feel is the strongest fundraiser in this competition.
And it at least would give Annie some good competition.
And if we can get one rich guy.
See, I got some people who are very wealthy here in New York
that I'm not even counting if they can come by.
Annie, she's been telling us all along she has unlimited funds.
I knew we were going to have a rough time of it,
so I put my guys to work on it immediately.
Hey, it's Clint for John.
Hey, Rick, it's Herschel.
  You guys need to call your people and get the biggest bidders that you can.
  We're going to put on a show for these people.
I feel like my job as project manager is two things.
Make sure we run a smooth event
and if I'm bringing in the most money on the team, by far,
I think it will be very hard to fire me.
  'Hello.'
  Hey, Scott, here's the deal,
we're auctioning off beautiful jewellery.
  'Right, right.'
  So, you know this is for charity, right?
'Yeah, yeah, of course.'
OK, so can you book the first flight out tomorrow morning
to New York to come buy a piece of Ivanka Trump jewellery for 25,000?
'Er, yeah, 25,000 is OK.'
And, like, if I needed you to go more you could do that, right?
Like, if I panicked at the end that I didn't have enough money you'd be cool, right?
  'Wow, erm...'
  Right?
Annie's very aggressive about raising money.
She almost bullies people.
Hey, Perry, I know you already bought the wedding dress for Robyn.
You should have jewellery to go with it.
I think that she wields enough power in the poker industry
that people are actually scared of her.
So Perry's in for a minimum of 20, and he's like, "Whatever it takes to win."
So just assume 25, then.
No, he'll do 40 if I need him to, he doesn't care.
If you look at past performance, I've out raised everyone on KOTU.
But the thing that worries me is that
when you look at somebody like Herschel Walker,
clearly he knows some very wealthy people.
We obviously can't control
if the other team's been saving up some crazy, huge fundraiser, right?
So I just want to let you guys know that if we lose the task
I'll have to bring people into the boardroom according to the amount of money that they raised.
And I just think that that's the fairest thing to do.
What? No! We're going to win!
All right, I'm just making sure.
'Annie came in and told us whoever raises the least amount of money
'on this task is going to be taken in to be fired.'
You don't want to sand bag, but you also don't want
to waste your bullets by bringing big money.
I kinda want it to go to my charity or be more when it counts.
All right, let's go win this.
We're totally going to rock this challenge.
When Natalie went to select the five items
from the Ivanka Trump jewellery collection,
Joan, Clint and myself went to our war room.
So how much do you think Annie will bring in?
Annie could call two poker players and get 140,000.
Let's hope that her friends just lost a bunch of money
and they don't have any cash.
Annie's got them all in her pocket.
We knew Annie was going to bring in a lot of heavy hitters.
And we had to come up with a strategy to beat that.
So I'm certain I have 20,000 in cash coming, say he has 60.
So the trick is going to be, we take the cheapest piece we have
and we buy that with, say, mine and Herschel's combined.
What we came up with was we were going to pool all our money together
and go after one inexpensive piece,
and try to make a large amount of profit on that one inexpensive piece.
If we don't sell a piece, then we don't have to pay the wholesale.
Right. All we want is to sell our cheapest piece for a lot of money.
We're going to win it and knock Annie out.
  Good morning.
  Nice to meet you.
Do want to just step right here and I'll go and get the first slide of jewellery.
This is the first slide of jewellery that you have to select from.
The ring.
I wanted to pick out really simple pieces that were classy and would
appeal to a lot of different people.
  I'm going to go with the earrings.
This is the second lot of jewellery.
I want to get things that look like they have a lot of value to them.
I would like to be able to hit all different types of jewellery,
and things that are going to look good from the stage.
  Mmmm!
  And the third lot.
  It's my choice now, right?
  Mm hm.
It's kind of hard when you're picking out stuff for yourself
and also you're picking out things somebody else might like.
The ring.
  Could you try this on for me?
  Yeah.
  I'm going to go with the necklace.
Melissa's selections were different than I expected.
She picked very chunky, trendy pieces,
and I tried to pick more kind of classic, traditional pieces.
This is our last lot, it's lot five.
  The earrings.
  OK, good choice.
Natalie picked beautiful jewellery. I mean, she picked things that I too would pick for myself,
but from an auction standpoint they didn't have any pop.
  Thank you very much.
  Good luck!
  Thank you.
OK, take care.
I am heading off to FIT to join the rest of my team.
At this point I don't know how my team is going to react to anything.
Things have been going on that
have made me question a lot of people on my team.
We definitely outsmarted them on the picks.
Natalie thought about what she would like rather than what it's going to look like, a lot of value.
So would anyone like to see? Starting are these earrings.
I was excited to show the jewellery,
but they didn't even bother patting me on the back.
They took it, looked through the pictures, bam. Didn't really care.
  Hi, guys!
  Hi.
So we got what?
Diamond earrings...
Which are the cheapest?
Here, I'll show you the order of cheap to...
After I picked out the jewellery,
I got some pictures and some information,
and I was excited to go back to my team to show them.
Small signature oval diamond drop earrings.
'I'm not happy with the jewellery that was picked out.
'It's beautiful, it's classic.'
But some of them were smaller than we thought they were going to be.
And they will not present themselves as well on a runway.
So your daughter, by the way, picked very flashy, chunky things, like this.
She's right.
Very, very chunky.
We didn't have a wow.
We didn't have a piece that when a girl walked out, you went, "Huh!"
I tried to get pieces that anybody could wear.
Yeah.
I'm not particularly happy with the donor situation.
I mean, let's be real, we only have four people left,
and I know that half my team aren't particularly good fundraisers.
It's Melissa.
Do you think she'd be into buying a major piece of jewellery?
Could you call her and tell her that I'll be calling her?
'I've watched other people fundraise. They get on the phone and they go like this,'
"Hi, we're doing a thing, do you think you could give me anything?"
They're not giving parameters, they're not asking for an amount.
Is it Stewey? I will come over and I'll tell Stewey he better pay up.
Annie and I were definitely spearheading the phone calls
to try to get the donors, cos we're going to need to pick up
the slack of Melissa and Jesse,
so we had to really, really pull out all the stops and call everybody.
  Stewey, it's Annie, do you remember me?
  'Yeah.'
So how much do you think you'd be willing to buy a piece of jewellery from?
'I'm an impulse kind of guy, honey,
'it could be zero right up to a billion,
'it's what I feel like doing...'
Well, if you give us a billion, we'll win!
One of my donors said he will raise as much money that needs
to be raised up to a billion dollars.
I'm sure he was exaggerating, but it got the point across.
'Don't worry, I probably will not let you guys down.'
We appreciate it. OK, have a good day. Bye.
  You know, I have this idea that I'd like to win this
  task.
  Well, we're going to.
Annie, who could not STAND Brande,
I mean, these two are now thick as thieves.
I know, I know, I'm going to try...
And now they're like bestie, bestie, besties. It's freaking Lord Of The Flies.
I have no idea why this turn of events.
  It's a lot of bull
  if you ask me.
Let's talk about our money.
I'm at 20, I'm waiting to hear if I'm going to 30.
OK, and what are you at, Herschel?
Erm, about 45.
I think Herschel and Clint did a great job with fundraising,
raised a ton of money, but it's not easy to do.
It makes me very uncomfortable to ask my friends for money.
Some people love it, I don't like it at all.
This sucks, it's going to be really hard going.
I've got calls in to everybody I know, I'm not sitting here going, "I can't raise."
I've been on the phone all morning calling people.
  We've just got to do the best we can possibly do.
I had already exhausted my rolodex of fundraisers, so I was
trying to think of somebody else that would want to give me money.
You know what?
Is there any poker players that would like to beat Annie?
That's a good question.
I wonder who would know that world.
The best strategy that I could think of was to use
a couple of people that were in the poker world.
It's Natalie, can you hear me?
You've got to get me the number of whoever would ever go against Annie.
So I called to see if there was like an arch rival or somebody
that would be wanting to help me out to go up against Annie.
So I'm finding out exactly who Annie's rivals are,
so I can call all of them and get their money.
  Right, excellent.
  We'll see.
  You two can go ahead and go, Clint and I...
  I'd like to get there at 12 o'clock.
I'm ready to go cos I have to make a stop.
Natalie and Joan decided to go to a department store and start looking at the different outfits,
so Clint and I stayed back to select the models.
Spread 'em all out.
Are the models ready?
Hi, come on in.
Can everyone identify who they are by their pictures, cos we're a little tired and confused.
So we have all the jewellery,
now we have to figure out how we want to show it
and find the models that we thought would best represent
each particular piece.
  Do you have pierced ears?
  Yes, I do.
  OK, great.
So could you start down there,
walk, stop at the chair as if that were the auctioneer and work a bracelet for me?
We definitely wanted models with personality who could help us work the room,
who could be able to sort of vamp,
and play with the audience and keep the excitement going.
  Could you give us the walk and an imaginary bracelet?
  Sure.
Can you work the bracelet for me?
I'd buy from her.
  Great, OK, we love you.
  Thank you!
No, cos we're going to pull hair back.
Brande, Melissa and Annie were pretty smart about checking out
the girls and making sure they had fresh manicures to show off their
hands with rings and bracelets and making sure their ears were pierced.
You know, which is pretty important!
  I think Clint and Herschel, those guys probably just picked the ones with the biggest
  How you doing? Herschel.
  Hey, I'm Clint.
  Hi.
  Nice to meet you.
  How you doing?
Er...
Why don't you just walk, just...
You've walked before...
  Thank you very much.
  Thank you, my dear.
You know, there's a lot of beautiful models out there,
and I think it's good to sit them down and to talk to them,
let them get to know you, you get to know them.
Hello there, how you doing? Where'd you get that blonde hair from?
Erm, I don't know, my parents!
  I'm probably a little bit older.
  Oh, no, age is good thing.
  Where are you from?
  I am from Arkansas.
  You don't know anything about chickens?
  Ooh! Fried chicken's my favourite.
I'm a lucky man.
I'm a lucky man I'm on this show.
I want to look at them and prioritise them.
Where's Heidi Klum?
And Naomi Campbell, what?
We need another blonde. we've got dark, dark hair, red hair, blonde.
  We need a blonde.
  I know where we can get a model.
Brande could wear the necklace for when Hugie is bidding.
  Who's Hugie?
  Stewey.
  Oh.
  I can be like, "Look at this beautiful girl, "how can you not buy this thing up there?"
  Ohhh!
We decided that Brande would be one of our models,
and we specifically decided she would wear the piece
that her donor was interested in. Then she can work the donor,
cos she has a personal relationship with the donor.
Well, I could always be on stage going, "Come on, that's not enough!"
Yes, yes, yes! See, I think that might be cute.
Brande's the obvious choice to use. She's the bombshell,
she's the ex playmate,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
I don't think Brande's ego could take it if we didn't choose her.
That's perfect.
I love this. Hello, what size is this?
This is great. Can we take this right off so they don't see it?
'I am very competitive, as we've all found out.
'As project manager I knew we had to get great clothes.
'I saw this red dress and we took it'
and they had two, and I begged them to get the other off the mannequin,
cos I don't want the other team to see it.
This is my friend, Marie Antoinette.
We've got red, we've got black. What other colour have you got?
  Going with the pearl here?
  I don't know.
I would...
The pieces that Natalie picked, would I have picked them?
I don't know, I don't know. So I worked with what was brought to me.
  That's the ring for that. Good, good.
  That's two.
OK, three is our...
Three, I would like to do a daytime.
Shopping was easy, Joan took control,
she had a good understanding of what she wanted to do.
She was very excited to put all the clothing on the girls
and to really match the jewellery with clothing, and did a great job.
All right, here we go, we got red here, guys.
  It comes with a full bottom?
  That's what you call a full bottom(?)
  Yeah, that's...oh.
  My!
She has the only good hands so she's the ring.
So let's look at these girls and see who we think each outfit should be.
Annie had a very specific plan.
All right, girls, let's go.
Put Brande in charge of picking out the clothes.
Oh, that's cool.
I think that I need to wear these.
Oh. This'll be cool.
We had one hour to dress four models and Brande,
and suddenly it became about "What is Brande going to wear?"
So basically I took over the other four girls.
You might think bracelet.
I love the idea of the earrings on you.
Let's all spread out for a few minutes and pool some stuff.
Oh, oh oh, for the necklace. I think that's kind of sweet.
Are you a four, could you fit into a four?
You can try it on.
  OK, this is our blue section, we do everything by colour.
This would look great on you.
Actually, I want to wear all of them.
I really like that with that necklace.
Come on, wide, wide, wide! Thank you.
Oh, that's darling on you. Come with me.
I saved that shopping expedition from turning into an absolute debacle.
Because while we were shopping, the only thing Brande really
worried about was what was Brande going to wear?
'Hi, Brande.'
Hello, Annie.
So, how'd it go?
Awesome. We got some amazing dresses.
Of course, as soon as we got in the car, Brande's phone rings,
and it's Annie to go over what we picked cos they're besties now.
Brande, are you going to look particularly hot?
I am going to be sophisticated and elegant, darling.
It really became, Annie, "Hi, honey! What'd you guys get?"
Eugh!
Perfect, that's perfect...
I'm really, really pissed at Annie's two facedness.
So we need to do an auction preview sheet.
We're selling some jewellery, I know you've probably seen them before,
it's a small picture with just a description.
OK, perfect.
Jesse and I went to the printer to make the auction preview catalogue.
  Let's keep it nice and simple.
  Yeah, that's it. This is all.
  Black, grey and red are good colours.
You know, I grew up in the auction business
so I knew I could add something to the game.
As far as like getting on the phone
and calling all my friends with like a million dollars, you know...
I do have some that would probably donate stuff,
but I don't want to use them all to try to save my own neck,
I'd rather just try to use hard work.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm pretty driven to win this thing.
  You like it?
  Yeah. That's all we need.
  OK, that's that.
Hey, it's Natalie. What you got? OK.
I was trying to get a hold of Phil Hellmuth,
who is the leading all time career money leader
for the world series of poker.
Really? But they not only have to jump on the plane, they have to kick out some money.
I was hoping that Phil would be able to come and help us out or to be on the phone,
and I was also secretly wanting to see Annie's reaction
to having arguably one of the greatest poker players of all time
that was going to be fundraising for me and not for her.
If they're willing to put out 25, 30 grand, I think it'd be great.
Amanda, send him in.
Thank you very much for coming.
I want you to keep an eye on things for me.
It's getting a little bit complicated and I tell you what, it's really rough.
Now, they're doing a charity auction of my daughter's beautiful jewellery line,
and it really is something special.
Annie and Joan, they're project managers, they hate each other.
I want you to watch out for them, report back to me.
Also, very importantly, Melissa, a little bit bratty,
a lot of people aren't liking her.
Jesse James hasn't raised any money.
You watch for them also.
And I do appreciate you being here.
Mr Trump, it's going to be my absolute pleasure.
There's only one celebrity apprentice,
and that's me.
I'm back.
