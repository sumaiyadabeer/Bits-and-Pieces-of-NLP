Good evening and welcome to Landward. In a moorland, Cyril find
out why deer farming is a booming We will find out what is happening
at the Scottish Ploughing Championships. It is a very high
level. Euan meets the new generation of Muck owners keeping
alive and island tradition. wanted our children to go to school
on the island. And we explore the relationship between Scottish
regiments and the landscape. Each of the companies would have been
clan was a colonel who was in charge of the Regiment.
As a nation, we have a growing appetite for Venice and. So much so
there is not enough deer in the country to satisfy demand.
Thousands of tons are imported from New Zealand every year. The
Sarah Mack has been to investigate.    deer farming.
Deer had been an integral part of the Scottish countryside or
centuries. The word Dennison comes from the Latin for hunting.    the
word, then nothing. Deer meat is regarded as one of the healthiest
that you can get you're hands on. What was once seen as a top end
food for special occasions is now more popular than ever before. So
popular that one of the UK's biggest suppliers cannot get his
hands on enough. I have never seen anything like it. Over the last
five years, it has gone from strength to strength. I have never
seen a situation like this, were hit we have someone begging for a
raw material and not being able to find it. Almost all Scottish
venison meat comes from deer shot in the wild. Only 2% comes from
farmed deer. Experts say that there is demand for up to 500 new forms.
to go into deer farming. So far, a few have risen to the challenge. At
this farm in Caithness, the final sections of fencing are going up at
Scotland's newest deer farm. The man behind this initiative is a
successful businessman who is keen to invest in this growing market.
We have been working on this for a long time. Finally all of the
fences are going up. Four kilometres were. We have gone
through it all of the various stages of bringing the pasture land
up to the right quality. I think it is the first time this land has
been used for commercial reasons for a very long time. His plans are
to raise the animals, slaughter them locally and market his own
brand. It will not be easy. It will take a couple of years to get there.
As I am fairly confident that this will produce more money than
anything else that I could have done with this land. Today, a new
delivery of animals arrive after a long journey from Dundee. These
newcomers put the total number at around 200 animals. They will
become the core breeding stock for the next 14 years. These young
animals have been supplied by one of the pioneers of deer farming
worldwide. The first commercial deer farming stock and began in the
1970s. It is still going strong today. But it has not always been
easy. Times have not always been as profitable as they are now. Various
things have happened. Demand has increased. We have been marketing
this very hard. It is a good story to tell and it is a good product. I
am delighted. That makes the whole thing worthwhile. Wild venison
numbers are declining as well so there has less coming in. We now
know how to farm these animals in Scotland, thanks to technology.
day to day management of this heard is the responsibility of the stock
man. An experienced cattle breeder who is well up for this new
challenge. They are really a wild animal. You have to respect them as
well as get the respect from them. The handling system will have to be
top notch. Exciting times ahead? Very much so, I guess! Deer farming
has proved a massive success in New Zealand. With a booming venison
market worldwide, it looks like Scottish Deer farming be finally
have come of age.    may finally have.
Last week, Nick Nairn spent a pleasurable time in the company of
one of the top whisky blenders. This week, he finds out about the
craft in finding the perfect place for whisky to mature.
In a heart of Scotland's Highland glens lies the Speyside Cooperage.
A business that has been producing and mending casks for the Scottish
whisking    whisky industry since 1947. Today, they still use the
same materials and skills that have endured for generations. We have a
couple of hydraulic machines which help the craftsmen, but we still
use the hand tools. We repair barrels by cleaning them to
increase their life span. We burner the inside of the barrel    Lee

traditional craft. It takes years to get to industry standards. They
do not use nails or glue. They are going to let me have a goal.    go.
Noisy as this?    is it has always    always as noisy as this? This is
American white oak. The winter is straight. How do you occur fared?
We used steam    how do you make it curved? We used steam. You have to
make sure that both ends are the same size. We use different colours
and flavours for different finishes. It is just planks of wood and some
metal hooks? That is right. What an amazing shake. It is such an
important part of the whole whisky process. These casks play a pivotal
role in the making of whisky. They help give it its flavour and colour.
To see a traditional industry like this still thriving in the
Highlands is as refreshing as the drink itself. Well, maybe not!
Still to come: Euan takes the short crossing from Eigg to Muck. It
looks quite straightforward, but some of the locals have said that
this is a very tricky entrance. And the fighting spirit is honed on our
rugged landscape. The Highland identity was crucial. They were not
part of the main mode of warfare disciplined throughout Europe.
With hi tech computerised tractors and sophisticated GPS systems, the
job of planning fields in preparation for sowing is quite
straightforward. But some far    some farmers like to keep their
hand in by using traditional planning methods.
   ploughing a methods. The Plough has been around for
hundreds of years. A simple design which has only got bigger when
technology improves. And it has revolutionised agriculture. With
one saying    with one simple action, the Plough replaces the
ground of old crops with new soil ready for our new crop. The
technology nowadays means that one man can do the work of many horses.
At the Scottish Ploughing Championships in the Black Isle,
men and machinery battle against the land with the aim of becoming a
champion plover.    ploughman. have conventional methods of
ploughing up as well as the traditional, and also a competition
for juniors. We have 130 competitors. This year, one of our
competitors has come from New Zealand. At the present moment,
we're at the top in the world. We want to stay there. Andrew Mitchell
has dominated the Scottish planning seen since 2003. Winning every year
apart from one. He is three times world champion. He will compete for
his 4th title at the World Championships in Croatia next year.
Not only that, he has a son who is also called Andrew. He is falling
fast in his father's furrows. the Scottish champion Andy came
back as the third place competitor in the world.    and he came back.
This is precision staff measured to the last inch. We would not want to
lead India to speak to him. It is like a top golfer on the 18th green.
They are in their concentration zone. That is why both father and
son are so successful. It is a complicated piece of machinery?
Many controls for adjusting all of the individual things. They want to
try to maximise points at all the various aspects. They have little
ways of modifying the Plough. like Formula One. What is the
history of all of this? If you remove the tractors and consider
horses, has it changed much? first competitions began at the
start of the 1700s. Landowners were trying to improve their soil. The
thought that better plumbing could be encouraged through competition.
It is one thing to let other people do it for you, I am now going to
try it myself. Bob has driven one of these for a long time. What have
we got here? This machine is from 1939. It can handle lots of
different types of land. Is it Competition ploughing is now one of
the fastest growing sports and I can tell you, it is a lot harder
than it looks. How am I doing, Bob? Very good.
Very good. That is quite impressive! If you like that, you

anniversary of the Scottish If you have a comment about
anything you see on the programme or have a great story to share,
please drop us an e mail. The weather here is sunny and pretty
fresh. But what about the prospects for this weekend and be on?   
A mild, wet and windy weekend to come across most parts of the
country. Let's look at the Atlantic pressure charge. The associated
weather fronts with this area of low pressure are pushing rain in
across most of the country and then tomorrow, as well. Some of that
will be heavy in places, and accompanied by a strong wind. There
will be some shelter because of the mountains, particularly along the
Moray coast, but across the south, highs of 13 to 14 degrees. In a
north east of the country, relatively dry and cloudy. The rain
is really focused in the west and north west. Temperatures for most
around 13 degrees. If you are hill  walking or climbing, it will be wet
tomorrow. The winds will be strong from a head    southerly direction.
In the east, the rain won't be as heavy but still a wet day. A strong
southerly breeze in the east, as well. If you are on the inshore
waters across the South West, here are the details. Further east, it
will be forced five per to force seven from a southerly direction.
Overnight, Saturday into Sunday, the rain eases away, leaving a dry
end of the night. Temperatures hold up at around nine it as the
overnight low. Into Sunday, another weather front pushers in from the
south west, bringing rain to south  western parts of the country. That
will extend into eastern parts. The wind brew that will be strong from
a south or south westerly direction.    the winds will be strong. The
next few days it is a story of more rain. We can see this area of low
pressure towards Iceland and the trailing weather front behind it
brings a bit of uncertainty. We know the focus of the rain will be
on the north west of the country and from Glasgow up to Aberdeen. If
you are south of that, it should be dry but cloudy. Into Tuesday, the
weather front pushes through bringing dry but showery conditions
through the north west. Elsewhere, not too bad with temperatures where
they should be for the time of year. On Wednesday, it turns wet and
windy once again. A strong southerly wind up, thanks to this
area of low pressure. The rain pushes in from west to east as we
Over the next three weeks, we will be exploring how the Highland
landscape has helped shape the British Army, from Culloden to the
present day. This week it is the Fort George, present home to the
original Highland Regiment, the world's famous Black Watch. The
watch was originally recruited by the British government to help rid
the Highlands of Jacobite dissent. After the 1715 rebellion, the
officer who commanded the Army in Scotland at the time realised that
he had to do two things. First, open up communications into the
Highlands, by building his roads, and he needed a watch forced to
keep abreast of what was happening. People who spoke the language,
Gaelic, who knew the country and could live off the land. General
Wade raised his militia in 1725 but it was not long before he earned
the name    before they enter the name, the Black Watch. Because they
had the job or watching the Highlands and because of the blue,
black and green tartan they wore after the watch had been formed,
they got a Gaelic nickname which meant the Black Watch. The Tartan
itself   if you had your played, it was very good camouflage of. It was
the deepest tartan to man of Fahd does have    to manufacture because
it had less collars in. At the soldiers were defined by the kilts
they walk, but a Highland landscape and culture they came from would
create a unique regimental identity. There Highland identity was crucial.
The way that they could be recruited, the way they are related
to their officers, the way that, in the beginning, they were bought and
trained, it was very distinct. They were not part of the mainstream
European, disciplined, regimented mode of warfare. They were coming
from a culture that had to a very long tradition of military service.
Each of the countries it would have been a clan in its own right. The
head of the clan was the colonel who was in charge of the regiment.
But Highland identity and ethos had been maintained right throughout
the regiment's history. After the Jacobite rebellion, the Black Watch
went on to be one of the most celebrated regiments in the British
Army, distinguishing itself in battles all over the empire.
think you could trace the history of the Black Watch and there, you
have the history of Great Britain and the British Empire. They fought
in most major campaigns. 8,000 men at on the Black Watch lost their
lives between 1914 and 1918, and 20,000 were wounded. This has
continued in World War II, in Korea, in Kenya and up to the present day,
where soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan.
nearly three centuries, Black Watch has been involved in conflicts
around the world. In 2006, they became three Scots, and it infantry
battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland's, and are currently on
operations in Afghanistan. In the summer, Euan McIlwraith set
out to sail to Peter, Muck and Canna and then back to the mainland
in five days. But the journey got off to race low start and he ran
aground. This week, we catch up with him as he leads Peter, bound
for Muck.    departs the Eigg. I am meeting be people who live on
these beautiful but tiny islands. Today, we are leaving the island of
Eigg and its community ownership for its amazing embracing of new

people. It has been under one family for generations. The wind
has dropped away to nothing, so we are having a gentle evening motor

Mary grew up on the island and then left to study. She moved back four
years ago with her partner, did take on the hotel. At the same time,
her brother Colin and his family moved back to take on the farm. Her
