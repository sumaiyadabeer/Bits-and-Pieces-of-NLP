If the you stab a burglar in your home that might be tough on the
insurer but should it be legal? De Justice Secretary himself says so.
But is he correct? Good morning and welcome to Sunday Morning Live
where you debate the big issues of the day. This week Ken Clarke said
that we have the right to take a poker to a burglar. A blow for
justice for a charter for a vigilantes? And a bit to stop
Sharia courts discriminating against women. Sharia law chords
are unacceptable in this country and should be banned. And as a
church is napped for healing that God can cure cancer, is faith 
healing an almighty cropper? Broadcaster Terry Christian is
against today. He spent some of his career dishing out abuse. Can he
take it? And our columnist has seen a burglar off in his own home. And
Bob Turney himself used to be a butler but is now a crime fighter.
on Twitter. Calls from mobiles made cost considerably more at than
network calls. We all know that we have the right
to self defence but how far should you be able to go to protect your
property from a burglar? A punch, a poker, or even a fatal attack with
a knife? This week the justice secretary said that he wants to
clarify the law. Just last week a man was arrested on suspicion of
murder after allegedly stabbing to death a masked intruder. Is it
right to use violence to protect your property? It is late at night.
You are asleep in your home. But you're not alone. Anne Owens wakes
you. You realise there is an intruder in your house. What would
you do? What should you do? If an old lady finds she has an 18 year 
old burglar in her house and picks up a knife, she has not committed a
criminal offence. The Home Secretary said the new Justice Bill
would clarify the position of home owners could defend themselves and
their property. Last week the householder was arrested after a
masked intruder to his home suffered a stab wound and later
died. But just because the justice secretary says that stabbing a
burglar will not be considered criminal, does it make it right to?
Is it a proportionate response? Is it right to kill someone if they
are just a threat to your property and not your life? In the heat of
the moment it can be hard to judge if an intruder is violent. There is
a sense of violation. I asked him why he could do that to us as
victims. So are the words of Ken Clarke a welcome clarification of
our rights to protect our homes or will be just encourage homeowners
to keep weapons by their bedsides, and perhaps burglars to come armed
to protect themselves? It is the job of police to protect us and our
property but once a burglar enters our home, should the law allow us
to be armed and dangerous? Bob Turney, 30 volt years since your
last prayer golds someone's house. Does this send a shiver down your
spine? Well Ken Clarke was talking about a grand mother who could stab
a burglar. What people do not understand, people take an life off
people and could use that to stab them. Now we're asking this morning
if there ought should allow West to stab burglars. Text us with your
opinion. We will bring you the result at the end the programme.
Then you consent is that his people feel that they should be arming
themselves if a burglar should come in, then that weapon could be used
against them? It could. The loo is perfectly clear as it stands. If it
is clear that the intruder is not going to exit, I can do anything I
like to get them out. But if they leave and I chase them and then
endure them, that is wrong. Juries are reluctant to convict people. We
had the Hussein brothers from a High Wycombe recently. Apparently
the family were tied up and the burglars left. What I would have
done, I would not have been bothered running down the road, I
would have looked after my wife and children. Mehmet, you have been
burgled four times. Yes, four times in the same house and twice with
young children there. Furious though I was, furious enough to
confront one of the burglars, and shout at him, I do not think that
the law was clear at the time. I had no idea that I up was entitled
to hit him round the head with a cricket bat. I don't think I would
ever has been stupid enough to use a knife. But I did not know that
the law was clear on it. Is it because you did not know that the
law was Clear, or what we do not have been able to have done that?
peak I was so wide up with adrenalin that I might have been
able to do that. Adrenalin will make you do things you never knew
that you could do. I do think that people will have a go at a burglar,
and why not? Is there a danger that the message that could be sent is
that this is not self defence committees meeting not punishment
on the spot? The big question is, Ken Clarke completely irresponsible
to say what he said. He is representing the government first
of all, they say they're going to get tough on law and order. But he
has just cut back police numbers by around 10%. Now he is saying that
you can stab a burglar. Then they will not have to put them in prison,
it gives him more prison places! I have been burgled as well. If a
burglar came into my house while I was there then I may well bring the
darkness to him. Let us say no more. What do you mean by that? Would you
stab a burglar? Depending on my mood and how I felt. I do not know.
But the idea that somebody is in your house. But if I stabbed a
burglar, I would feel terrible. I do not have that much that is worth
stealing anyway and most people are insured. But does this take that
into account? That you can talk about if you should be able to stab
someone, but actually the consequences of that for the
individual responsible would be devastating. I think in the cold
light of day you would feel terrible about having killed
somebody. And you should be wary of guns and knives. What I do think is
that most people in my street who have been burgled many times are
well aware that the police do not stand a chance of finding the
criminal. And knowing that and being burgled more than it once, it
has developed ahead of steam. You know that there is no other redress.
And you would have a go at them. I cannot see what is wrong with that.
But I know that if a burglar was in my house, he would not be coming
for my children. How do you know that? You could be unlucky enough
to have a dangerous psychopath. When you have a teenage daughter,
do you want to wait and see? Help when you live with the fact that
you have killed somebody? In 1961 armed robbers used to run about
with pick axe handles. There was a significant robbery in east London
when the bank clerks opened fire on the robbers and from then on they
started to carry weapons. So the burglars themselves if they know
that people can come at them, we will have this massive walk on our
hands which is not necessary. put some of those questions to some
of the guests we have this morning. Jay Patel, you're beaten up as part
of an armed robbery at a post office. You fought back and chased
them off. You felt under attack, but if they had simply entered the
Post Office, would you have used violence against them? Good morning.
It is a difficult question to answer. The adrenalin does kick in
as you mentioned. And in love asked how you could live with having
killed someone. But we are not there to kill or attacks someone,
we are trying to protect our own property and family. If someone
enters your property, it is your personal space. They are not
required to be there so you're going to attacked to protect your
selves and he will use any means available and you will attack.
You're not going to ask if they want a cup of tea. But you will get
more and more examples of Tony Martin who shot a burglar. He had
an illegal Far arm with him, he shot a 16 year old. The 16 year old
late in his driveway calling for his mother. He went round with a
loaded gun looking for the other broker. I defend anyone's right to
defend their property but it is about going over the top.
understand what you're saying. You're talking about individual
cases with Tony Martin. We do not know how many times he was attacked.
I will tell you, he had an out house broken into three times. He
actually fired upon people who were stealing apples from his orchard.
So Lee Wilkie that element, and then it will be carnage. Just tell
us, what did you feel in that moment when those brokers came into
the Post Office? Went the robbers came in originally it was a shock
to my system. You do not know what is happening. What the effects
would be. It is just when they started pushing people around, they
had guns and pointed it at you. It is a life and death situation. They
have the fear that their as well and the adrenalin. I want to go to
Sarah Newton who was a police officer but works now with young
people to prevent crime. Can't you talk to us about this concern that
if people feel that they can't use whatever force is necessary, not
just to defend themselves but their property, what effect could that
have on the burglar? Whether it that would create an escalating
sense of violence? I think it absolutely wood. The system is
clear at the moment. It says we can do whatever is reasonable. It is
for a jury to decide. I think Ken Clarke should focus on a system
that delivers proper justice, not revenge or vengeance. Nick Freeman
is a criminal defence lawyer. You must have defended burglars in your
time. What do you think about that, that we blur the line between self 
defence, defence of property, and vengeance and punishment, meting
out the punishment on the site? do not think we should ever have a
licence for lynch mob justice. The law is not in a state of confusion.
And I think what Ken Clarke said will give the wrong message to
people. People think that they can stab a burglar but you cannot. At
the moment you can use reasonable force, as long as you have an
honest and genuine belief that the force that she knows is
proportionate, you can do what you want. So the example that Ken
Clarke has given about the old lady stabbing an 18 year old. If she
believes that that amount of force is necessary to protect our
property then she's entitled to use it under the current laws. Other
problem is most burglaries are committed by repeat offenders. And
they are being put back on the Barbara from the West Midlands says
if someone comes into your home you have a very right to attack. Steve
says there is no right or wrong answer. To protect his wife and
children, and man would be prepared to give his life. But he might
think differently confronted with an unarmed child committing the
same crime. That is right. I think you taking instinctive view based
on who is on your house. The guy who brought into my house, he was
clearly drugged up and he had both hands in his pockets. He could have
had something in his pockets. He was well over 20 but I would have
taken a very different view with a guy who looked to be about 15.
if there was a situation, you could get it wrong? That is the risk of
the burglar. If he is going to break into your house and I make a
genuine mistake about the violence level, that is his problem. I think
what Ken Clarke said was borderline stupidity. The example he gave of
the granny and the 18 year old, I tell you what, if this Government
keeps attacking pensions the way they are, the grannies will be
doing the burglaries. At Government does not tell me what to do if
someone comes into my house. language was like Cluedo. Pick up a
poker. The candlestick in the drawing room. What hes Ken Clarke
doing, he made a complete hash of the rape issue? Then he was
defeated on his have time for sentences. They have got to get the
old chestnut about. We can kill a few burglars, that will bring us
back. Let's try and keep this away from the politics because for
people... THEY ALL TALK AT ONCE It may not be about politics.
You say that it is. Completely. the law is to be changed, that is a
political matter. This woman works with young offenders. The argument
is that it is all about politics but to take it back to those young
people who might be at risk of offending, what do you think of the
idea that they leave their rides at the door, once you have committed a
crime and broken into someone's house, anything goes? I just cannot
believe that we want to live in a society where that is OK. Each
young person has their own story and their own reasons, and I am not
saying that burglary is not a crime that effects are victims, but every
young person is a victim of their circumstances. If I drive my car at
100 mph and I am involved in an incident, I do not know what is
going to happen at 100 miles an hour, so why do not know what will
happen if I going to someone's house. I was one of the young
people you used to work with. But they need to understand when the
going there. But the household also needs to understand there is a
degree of where you draw the line. But the Government is now promoting
violence. Young people, very often, especially those from chaotic
backgrounds, they do not have lines drawn. This will make it much
clearer although Ken Clarke put did very badly. This makes it clear
that the line is trying on the doorstep. There is one more guest...
THEY ALL TALK AT ONCE David Cameron said we have to send a clear
message to those that carry knives, it is completely unacceptable in a
civilised society. He said that two weeks ago and you
have Ken Clarke's standing up and saying... That is inside the house.
The reality is that before Thatcher came men hardly anyone had any
burglar alarms. There was a massive crime wave that coincided with the
high levels of unemployment in the 1980s. By 1985, nearly everyone had
a burglar alarm. It's this man is also reformed burglar who works
with young offenders. We have had this issue about how political this
is. I wonder what do you think about the idea that there is a
sense that burglars do not get dealt with by the police,
householders feel they do not get dealt with by the prison system,
that people want more power to deal with it? This is the problem, the
law as it stands says you can use reasonable force to protect your
home and your family. There are two issues, if you are protecting your
family, you should protect whatever force is necessary to protect human
life which is far more valuable than your goods. Thought I would
say to Ken Clarke to has come out with this statement about taking
the law into your own hands, in the mind of the burglar he does not
want to attack the family. 90 % of burglars want cash, jewellery,
credit cards, most of them are on some kind of substances...
I live next door to a man who    I live next door to a girl who was
raped by the Notting Hill rapist. How could I possibly tell that the
person who had broken into my house was not the Notting Hill rapist?
That might have been in the 80s... Just let him speak. You should
never ever corner a burglar. You're asking for trouble. I am speaking
from experience, from being a burglar, and from my experience,
they carry screwdrivers, hammers, all kinds of weapons, not to attack,
but to get into the property. My advice would be never ever confront
a burglar, but let him get out if your property because goods can be
replaced. If I was taught, I would be making my way out of the door
because I am a coward. We must leave the discussion there. You can
vote in our text opinion poll. Should the law let us attack
burglars to defend our property. You have around 20 minutes before
the opinion poll closes this morning. It is time for our Sunday
Stand where we hear from someone who thinks that they are right
about something the rest of us have not woken up to yet. Sharia lot to
many conjures up images of barbaric justice, Estonians, beheadings, but
happily Sharia courts in our country do not going to that thing
but are commonly used for property disputes are disputes about
marriage. But a bill before the House of Lords says that we still
need to protect women from the effect of Sharia.
Sharia chords are unacceptable in this country and should be banned.
In Sharia courts women's evidence is less valuable than men's, they
cannot be judges, and they have fewer rights over divorce, property,
inheritance and even over the custody of their own children. In
some countries, Sharia Law Handy's    hands about cruel and unusual
punishments. We do not have legalise stoning Sir amputations in
this country but we do have Sharia courts trying to impose a system of
lot that is institutionally sexist and unequal. This is unacceptable,
or it should be. Our law is the expression of all that is best
about our country and it is what makes this country are tolerant and
civilised place to live. That is why there is no other place for any
kind of other lie in this country, whether it is Islamic, Jewish or
any other law. That is why it is important to make a stand against
people who are trying to make Sharia courts more and more
acceptable here. If you have a webcam, you can make your point on
Skype, or you can use Twitter or e  mail us. We have said goodbye to
Bob for just a moment. Aina Khan joins me now, a family lawyer who
specialises in Sharia lot. Welcome to Sunday Morning Live.    Sharia
law. You heard the arguments of Minette Marrin, do you support what
she says? I am a solicitor specialising in English family law.
It is only by women clients asking me for an alternative solution to
the huge expense of English justice, which is very delayed in the family
courts, very expensive and acrimonious. They want an
alternative. Do you charge less money for Sharia? Lawyers charge
money for everything I am afraid. It is the same hourly rate. But I
can help those people who really need me. You're suggesting that it
is a more co operative, consensual form of justice? That is the aim of
it, but when emotions are height and nothing ever works out like
that, it can be highly acrimonious. The Government is pushing mediation
because we have a family system which is at breaking point. We
cannot deal with any more cases the way they are just now. Minette
Marrin, the justice system is clogged up, this is an alternative
form of the Big Society, it is a more consensual form of justice?
The courts are indeed club up and very expensive but we already have
mediation under English and Scottish law. You can go to that.
You do not need specialist Islamic, or a Jewish, or other arbitration
bodies. Insofar as they are caught with British, English law, they are
redundant. I think this is the thin end of the wedge. What is the point
of a Sharia court. People living this country. There is nothing to
stop Muslims advising Muslims, but I am tired of hearing about it.
I explain...? Can I tell you first. I think Sharia law is being brought
to certain communities to stop the spot light being shone on those
communities on the fact they oppress their women. I will explain
the reality. The media loves black and white headlines. The reality is
that the majority of my clients are women. 90 % of them asking for
these solutions. Men are often against Sharia solutions. It is not
in their interest. Minette Marrin is right, there is mediation. And
the Muslim community does have trained mediators, but it is not
for that. Primarily it is for women seeking divorces. Muslim women go
to the Sharia council. They are self appointed, they are not courts.
Their marriages are not recognised under Sharia law, so why would you
go and get divorced under Sharia? I grew up in any area with children
who were Pakistani, and I can tell you about this, none of them wanted
arranged marriages, they did not want have thought the stuff that
was forced on them. Shari Allah is great, if you are that religious,
you want to do that.    Sharia law is great. If you want to do that,
you can abide by it. But I do not want any of mac tax money going to
a law which is outdated. How is tax money paying for it? It is our
alternative system. Who's going to be paying for the masks? Leaving
aside the question of taxpayers' money which I think is a red
herring, we should resist at every level, and parallel system of law
which is not equivalent to English law, creeping in by the backdoor.
In a recent opinion poll, something like 65 % of British Muslims would
like to see Sharia last year for We need to resist the introduction
of any other system of law all into this country. I think the majority
of Muslims want English law but we want absolution which work for us
under both. It is the pin end of the wedge. Not true at all.
Sensationalist. That is how a lot of people feel. According to one
opinion poll 40% of Muslims want Sharia law all in this country.
Cappagh and Heseltine joins us. You got a divorce in this country. What
was the benefit of getting a divorce in this country in that
Sharia law council? It was actually a lot more straight forward, less
stressful, less expensive, and process of getting a divorce
through British law, at which I also did. The important thing is
that it is about choice. As a Muslim woman, I appreciate people's
concerns but I do not need anyone else to decide what is best for me.
If it is my choice to go to a council, which is simply a way of
being able to go through that process of getting the divorce that
I wanted... Can I just interrupt to ask you a question. In the divorce
that you had, where both parties agree a port at the time? It was
myself who wanted it but my husband did agree to it and then it was a
straightforward process. Most Muslims in this country would
married a cousin. So it is a different thing, there is a lot of
emotional blackmail. Let's keep this within the family group and
use a Sharia law player ought to stop it getting out. So that case
is not really typical. I would say that just because I'm quite does
not mean... Those women are also capable of making their own choices.
But they would be forced to go to Sharia law le all instead of
English law. The principle of Islamic law is that you have to
consent. There cannot be forced. is the same with our law, anyone
can arbitrate. The reason that the Bill has been brought to the House
of Lords is that they have been many cases, a significant number of
women who have been adduced in one way or another at have not
consented. And worse still, they are not well informed about their
rights and are quite often bamboozled. Claims are made by
those around them that the Sheniah court has more powers than it does.
I totally agree with that and as a lowlier I do not pull them to court.
They have no power of enforcement. There councils set up because of
public demand by women who wanted at divorce. It is as simple as that.
What about those women who have changed in marriages? Do you not
feel sorry for them? I just think that what has been happening, keep
Sharia law took yourself. But there is British low wall. It does not
deserve a Muslim marriage. You can get divorced in Islam, legally. So
you can get divorced in Britain, legally. If you have an Islamic
marriage, you may never be validly recognised under English law, so
you have to have an Islamic divorce in order to marry again. I want to
bring in a judge in in the Sharia courts. One criticism is that women
are discriminated against under this system of law. Is the evidence
from women in a Sharia court equal to that of a man? In family matters
that is a misunderstanding, in family and pastoral matters their
evidence is equal. And 90% of the users are women. It is not forced
on anyone. What is Europe response to the claim by some that Cherie at
low walk is in some ways discriminatory? For instance what
does it say about homosexuality? This type of case is beyond the
jurisdiction. So to bring criminality into it it is confusing
the argument. Where does appear that simple comic interpersonal
relationships. But what about cases of domestic violence? Is it not
also about custody of children? Most of the Sharia councils do not
decide about children and property. We do not hear any case unless they
have also applied to a civic court. And what about cases of domestic
violence? Women are not encouraged to go to the police in the Islamic
community. What is happening, if there is any domestic violence,
their case in the Sharia Council becomes very easy. If there is
evidence we take it seriously into account. That is my experience,
that going to the police actually helps your case. And why not use
every year all that can protect you as a woman? You have to make sure
it is stand up for a new it rights and I'm saying use whatever
jurisdiction you can. The problem is that the councils as you call
them, are up over riding their proper limits. And secondly there
are a great deal of women who are at risk and who are not well
informed. There easily misled. They may not speak much English. You can
carry on with that debate online. Still to come this morning, at some
faith healers claim that they can cure cancer and HIV. Are they just
exploiting the sick and the desperate? Contact us with your
opinion so. And keep voting in our text poll this morning. Should
there will allow us to defend our property from burglars? You have
around five minutes before that closes.
Now it is time for what our guests but whether Big Mole moments of
that week. And the sexual assault case against the former chief of
the IMF? You wonder about the reasons why a, the timing is very
convenient and won the IMF chief is not helpful to the American No
authorities because of his stance on the economy. The district
attorney who brings the case against him manages to get in the
media and the anonymity of the alleged perpetrator is completely
gone for ever. It does not matter whether he is charged, whether it
turns up that the victim has no credibility, he is destroyed for
ever. Do think that should happen in oral cases of alleged assault,
but there should be anonymity for all of used? Absolutely. In this
case the press is the judge. That is wrong. The reaction of the
Labour leader to the strikes which took place? There was a photograph
of David Cameron and Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg altogether on the
day of the strikes. They were all the same. Like George Orwell book,
the animals looked to the humans, they could not tell which was which.
What would you have liked to see? would like to have heard Ed
Miliband standing up to support the strikes. And asking the question of
if there is this massive deficit, then you get rid of public sector
workers, they are not paying wages, then private sector workers lose
their jobs in turn, is this ideological or is it really helping
Britain's budget deficit? Meanwhile, Mehmet, an e mail from a mother in 
law quote you are. Yes, the mother  in law all from hell. She is
Caroline borne who wrote this extraordinary e mail to her future
daughter in law, Heidi Withers, and said that she was bolder and common,
she needed to go to finishing school if she wanted to giant the
family. This was following an overnight trip to their house.
Completely delicious. Clearly a very stupid to slag off your
daughter in law to her face and on e mail. And I began to think,
because I had a mother in law from hell, she was famously a holy
terror and there was nothing much that you could do. But in this case
these women has been named and shamed across the internet. Was her
mistake to criticise the future daughter in law or to do it by e 
mail? E mail is very dangerous because you're accountable for
everything you say. And it is not exactly going to get your message
across very constructively. The doctor in the war goes on the
defensive, everyone takes an entrenched position and nobody wins.
It is a notoriously tricky relationship. If it all goes pear 
shaped, the step mother could say, I told you so. Some people are so
determined to do what they want that only extreme measures like
public exposure could stop them. I wish we had this route open to us
when I was first accepted reluctantly into my mother in law's
family. It on had a son in law or daughter in law and think my family
are so used to mother in laws from hell that they would hardly notice.
She is a witch. It is true. I think with three sons I am sensitive
about that, I am aware that I could be a mother in law in the future to
possibly three different women. daughter has actually written in a
play about her mother in law flowers so comically ghastly.   
who was so comically ghastly. we asked you at the beginning of
the programme if there ought should allow us to defend our property
against a burglar. We will bring you the results at the end of the
programme. That has now closed. Faith healing has never been short
of believers and detractors who think it is best unprovable and at
worst Pebsham. So the advertising standards authority has warned
about a leaflet claiming that guard can heal everything from back pain
to cancer. Religions across the world have faith in its faith
healing. Is there any truth to their claims or do they just pray
on our week Ms?    our week Ms? They are an estimated 20,000 faith
healers in the UK. To believers there are just more than an
alternative to their local doctor. He is an amazing guy. You just look
into his eyes and you see the universe was a up for Sam Thaiday
killing is a last resort when Western medicine has run out of
answers. But to many in the modern world a few years are the
unacceptable face of religion. And there is concern that believers may
actively avoid seeking proper medical care. Last week a couple in
America were sentenced to jail for failing to seek medical care for
the infant daughter who needed an operation on her eye. There's no
clear scientific evidence for faith actually healing disease. Even so,
the belief that faith can bring miracle cures motivates many to
make the pilgrimage to places like Lloyds. Since records began over
7000 people have claimed to be Curate there. But even the Catholic
Church believes the real number is Should we leave it to those of
faith to decide if it makes them feel better? It may be arrogant to
think that only western medicine has all the answers, but without
evidence our faith healing claims of curing cancer a dangerous? Our
faith healers exploiting the vulnerable, and for the dying are
told that they only need faith and continue to worsen, does this add
to their misery? Our faith healer charlatans, you can join in by a
webcam? We welcome to the studio Pastor Brian Madden. How many
people do you think your prayers have helped? A significant number
of people, according to reports received back. I would like to say
that I am not a faith healer, I am a born again Christian who believes
in Jesus Christ. We pray for the sake. I do not get any gain out of
it other than the satisfaction of seeing people's lives transformed.
I have seen people healed of cancer, deafness, blindness, this is
something that is normal or to any evangelical pastor. With regards to
the leaflet, I think it is just another attack on evangelical
Christians. You mentioned at the start of the programme that we had
a young man a few years ago that was badly injured in a car crash.
His father came to our church and at that time we were having a
series of healing meetings were we were seeing tremendous medicals
which was in a lot of the newspapers. He phoned us to pray
for him because he had heard that he had died on the operating table.
We had thousands of people praying, and we prayed, and a few months
later we got a phone call back to tell us that he had been dead for
13 minutes but that he came back to life and made a full recovery.
Minette Marrin, Heidi you explain to a family who believe that the
prayers of thousands have brought back their son from the dead, how
do you explain that? I would never try personally to offend people by
saying that I did not believe in their claims are personally
disrespect in their religious views. I would not say to them what they
actually believe, that prey is completely useless. But I have did
a lot of research and thus, when I used to work for BBC religious
television programmes, I did research for several years and I do
believe that things changing people, the relationship between mind and
body which is one, in fact. It is a mysterious thing, and I was dying
to put some really good cases on the screen, but I had to drop the
programme because I could not find a single one that was well
documented. Do you mean you could not find the case that was clearly
explained through prayer as opposed to medical science? They did not
have an equally good if not better medical explanation, but leaving
aside prayer and hands on healing, and the different ways that people
try to heal other people, what struck me including going to lot of
Christian meetings, is that you have a tremendous UPS well of
religious enthusiasm and excitement and there are various rituals in
which people get themselves into an altered religious state. We did
some experiments with people interested in shamanism, and you
get a release of endorphins, the body's natural opiates. At these
meetings, people say, stand up if you have cancer, and they come
forward and they feel blast. They may feel better there and then but
it is an endorphin rush. Terry, they feeling better? Every kind of
psychological survey says that the more faith you have, the better it
is for you. It is a great thing, faith in anything. I grew up
Catholic and my only question is, because I can remember people are
going on pilgrimages to be healed, I can remember coming in after a
night out, and there was a bottled holy water in a lemonade bottle. I
felt really thirsty, I thought that we had lemonade in the house. I
took a big swig a fake, and I spend a lot of time on the tile at the
next day so it had the opposite effect on me. My big question about
miracle cures, why can it not cure an amputee? Let's say you had an
arm missing, is that not going to be easier to cure than a cancer?
Could you? It is an old chestnut, it has been asked on many occasions,
and if I were God, I could answer that. My wife is an amputee so I
know exactly what Teddy is speaking about. I did not mean to offend you.
I also have a severely handicapped daughter. Why does God kill some
and not others, I do not know. One woman sick could not be here had
the most aggressive cancer that anyone could have. Stomach cancer.
No one has revived it, but she went to pray and she was sealed. There
is no explanation.    no one has survived it. The problem with
hospitals is that because of the medical profession they will never
say that God has done the ceiling. The doctors will say that we have
no explanation. They say, maybe someone    maybe some day science
will give us an explanation. have an enormous amount of guests
but not an enormous amount of time. 50 clinical trials into faith 
healing do not prove that it works, does it? I was speaking to a doctor
who has just published a book about it, I GP in Sheffield, and he has a
wealth of evidence from all over the world that belief in Jesus
Christ as benefit your health. it cure your cancer? There are well
documented cases of cures for cancer. Medics are understandably
sceptical because we want the truth, we want to be able to say, was it
the prayer, or was it a spontaneous cure? But particularly in other
parts of the world when the look at the documenting of these things,
such as in Africa, and I was speaking to another GP who has been
out to Nigeria, and there they demand that HIV/AIDS patients
always have documents from the laboratory that they have HIV. They
have to show documented laboratory evidence that they have been cured.
Doctor, HIV can only be treated with anti retroviral drugs, that is
the medical fact of the matter? fact is that they can be well
treated with anti retroviral drugs, but the fact days that prayer in
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ will, on occasions, at his
discretion, it will seal HIV/AIDS. For Professor, you're a
psychologist at Goldsmiths University of London. What do you
make of claims like that? I think that is absolutely outrageous, the
claim we have heard. Are we meant to believe that those people who
were being treated for HIV were not receiving conventional treatment at
the same time. If that is what is being said, that is outrageous. If
they were receiving conventional treatment, that was probably what
cured them and not the prayer. I think it is dangerous. Can I just
say, when I was 17, I was a crazy young man, my mother sent me to a
psychiatrist. I am not a psychiatrist... At 19 years of age
I find Jesus Christ and he transformed my life. He transformed
my crazy mental state. Professor, is there a benefit when it comes to
mental states, not physical ones? The important things here is that
we're dealing with psychological problems which can be cured by
psychological means and belief is a hugely important factor. We have
heard that when people try to track down these claims, we have an
absence of evidence. Yes, psychologically you might be helped
by the power if you believe, no one could deny that, the placebo effect,
but to actually imply that you can be cured of a serious disorder like
cancer through the power of prayer is dangerous, immoral and
outrageous. You're a former sergeant in the army, medically
discharged, what happened to you? was in the Army for 15 years and I
was meant to be discharged in 2003. I was discharged with chronic back
pain. Do you feel that faith  healing help? I did not know much
about healing but a friend of mine in the Church asked me if anyone
had prayed for my injuries, and I said, no. He laid hands on me with
I have been physically Flett.    physically fit. They are great
stories, and maybe something did happen, but to me they are a
collection of chip shop anecdotes. I cannot understand if Darren is
saying that his leg grew, how much did it go?
It was a number of inches. Because my pelvis was so badly twisted, I
walked like someone who was 6 ft 5, I walked leaning over to one side.
When they laid hands on me, I was sitting on the seat with my feet
straight out, and you could see the difference in the length of my legs.
If you have good documentation of this, it would be extremely
interesting. But I question whether the facts are never there. We must
bring that discussion to an end. The result of our text opinion poll
is in. We asked if the law should letters attack burglars to defend
our property, and this is what you Pastor Brian Madden, the audience
may be surprised to learn that you used to be a burglar? What do you
make of that overwhelming public vote? I have to say that I never
burgled homes, it was mostly wine stores, but I am surprised at that.
To protect oneself is Blakeley, you can defend yourself.    to protect
yourself, you can defend yourself. Batam surprised about that. In
Romans 13, Paul the apostle, it is very clear at that if the sort of
justice falls on you for evil doing, it is on your own head.    the sort
of justice. Do you think that would make you more in securing your home,
Minette Marrin? I might in a rational discussion like this, but
on the day, fired up and frightened, know.    no. You can continue the
debate some line. Thank you to all our guests. Please do not taxed or
