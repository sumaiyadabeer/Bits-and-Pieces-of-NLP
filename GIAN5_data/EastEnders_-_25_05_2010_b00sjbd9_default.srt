You're up early.
You've nothing to worry about.
Today's going to be fine.
We've got the social worker on our side, and I don't think Lisa's going to put up any objections.
Louise is going to be yours, Phil.
Can you iron this for me?
What am I, your skivvy all of a sudden?
I've got to sort Ben out, he's still sick.
  You're staying home today.
  Has something happened to Jordan?
Shirley's coming to court, Minty will look after you.
  Dad?
  Brief reckons we shouldn't be too long, it's pretty much an open and shut case.
As long as we all do what he tells us, yeah?
Say the right thing, don't say anything we shouldn't.
And don't make any waves. Yeah?
Yeah.
D'you remember the story of Cain and Abel?
Cain gave God a sinful offering.
God rejected it,
but Cain didn't learn from that, he became angry.
But God was gracious, he told Cain, if you do right, you will feel right...
..but the clutches of sin were crouching at Cain's door, waiting to devour him.
What's that got to do with anything?
He fell deeper into the depths.
Why are you saying all this?
Until, finally, he murdered his brother, Abel.
Dad...
I think the nurse wants to talk to you.
Are you sure?
I'll go off my head if I stay in that house.
It'd only be for a couple more weeks.
A couple of days would be two days too many.
Well, you are eight and a half months pregnant you know...
I mean you should be taking it easy.
She will be taking it easy.
  Ah, Phil?
  Nothing.
Just feel free, wear out my lino like everybody else.
How's Jordan?
  I want you to look after Ben today.
  Why, what's happened?
  Keep him out of the way.
  Phil?
I'll take over when I get back from court.
  He's a bit jumpy right now.
  Yeah, he's not the only one.
I keep telling him it happens, kids muck about, someone gets hurt.
How many times did we knock someone over playing football?
They didn't end up with a fractured skull.
I got Ben that new football game, you said you wanted to have a go on.
  Yeah, you still haven't told me how Jordan is.
  I don't know.
  Well, haven't you phoned?
  Haven't you?
  Me?
You locked him in there.
I didn't know he was in there.
Well, if help had come a bit sooner.
  It wasn't my fault.
  Yeah, and it wasn't Ben's fault.
It was an accident. Like I keep telling him.
Can I get you another one?
  I'm OK, thanks.
  Right, you might be OK, but I'm not.
You see, this is a caff. It's a business.
And for it to stay in business, people have to buy teas, coffees, bacon sandwiches and stuff...
not just sit there like it's some kind of drop in centre.
Now I've explained that to you, I'll ask the question again.
Can I get you another one?
Yeah, you can actually. I'll get this. I'll have another one.
  Liam?
  Yeah.
  Right, so that's two coffees and a lemonade please.
What? It's the least I can do.
  Made a really nice bundle out them T shirts, didn't we?
  Yeah?
Enough to send everyone off to Alton Towers.
It's enough for this big wuss here, but rides make him sick.
Ain't you the doting sister?
  It was meant to be me and Billie...
  But he's a big wuss too?
  His country needs him. He's out training.
  He probably just didn't fancy it.
  What does that mean?
  It's for kids, isn't it?
Yeah, you should try it, you'd fit in really nicely.
  Billie'll be going off for real soon.
  Not that soon.
  It's a few weeks, isn't it?
  Yeah, well, he gets loads of leave.
Anyway, what are you doing here? Just, you seem at a bit of a loose end.
Why? You fancy the company?
No, but I have got a lot of T shirts I need to print up.
  What's that?
  What's it look like? What d'you reckon?
You've knocked out weird stuff but that beats 'em all.
  Stace.
  Good luck. You'll need it.
  Mo ain't knocking it out.
  What you doing with it then?
You're having a laugh.
  Good for the old farmers, this.
  I haven't got farmers.
You soon will have, you wait.
Anyway, you can't stand up all day.
So I'm going to sit down all day instead, on that?
  Not all day.
  Just in between customers.
Charlie's sun chair ain't good enough, now this ain't.
How many more times, Nan? Loads of women work right up until they pop.
Loads of daft mares get rushed into hospital cos they've overdone it.
There ain't a rule book.
There ain't a law says I can do this and not that.
Who fed you that load of old toffee?
Sounds like something out of a Christmas cracker.
  Max.
  That figures.
  Oh, whatever, I'm the mum.
  And I'm the gran.
  I'm the great gran.
  I'm the mum's best mate.
  Three to one, Stace.
  You're outnumbered.
  Who asked you?
  Ryan's making sense.
That'd be a first for him.
What? Thought you were opening up.
I will be. In a minute. Listen...and learn.
  Libby, how's Jordan?
  What?
It's just that I've been thinking about him most of the night.
You've been thinking about Jordan?
I've got a brother too. I know that if anything ever happened to Ricky...
Well, he's stable.
That's about all the doctors are telling us right now.
And how's Lucas?
I mean he must be frantic. His little boy.
I haven't got any myself, but you know, Liam, Morgan, Tiff,
I treat them like they're my own and if anything happened to them,
and something like this happens, makes your blood run cold.
I've got to get something from the house, so...
  Well, I can do that for you if you like.
  What?
Yeah, just tell me what you need and I'll bring it down.
Hey, you shouldn't be running errands at a time like this,
you know, you should be by Jordan's bedside.
What's all this care and concern all of a sudden?
I'm just interested.
Obviously. Why?
I'm just...I'm trying to be nice.
I think she sounded quite hopeful.
So why keep him in a coma?
Well, it's only for a bit longer, ain't it?
Another 24 hours she said. At least.
Yeah, that's just as a precaution.
  A precaution against what?
  Just to make sure that he recovers, OK.
  Yeah, but will he?
  What?
Come on, we're all thinking it.
One of us might as well just say it, you know. It's like Jordan, he might be out of danger now.
But who's to say that he ain't going to have problems later?
You know with it being like, a head injury.
Brain damage.
All I had to do was go in his bedroom and just check he was OK.
  This isn't your fault, it's mine.
  What?
I've done wrong and my son is being punished.
  This is no one's fault, it's got nothing to do with being punished.
  You don't understand.
Yes, I do, you're beating yourself up because you agreed for Jordan to go to the Arches, right?
If he'd gone to the shops to get milk, and fallen
off his bike on the way back, that would be your fault too, would it?
Nurse, will you tell him that this is no one's fault, it's just a simple accident.
The police will need to speak to Jordan, though. I did explain that.
Yeah, but that's just routine thing, you said?
Is it?
You've got a house full.
Yeah, Liam's got a few of his mates round.
Right, let's get started on these.
You actually want to print T shirts?
Yeah. What did you think we were going to do?
Nothing, I thought you wanted to hang out.
Let's get started.
Right.
I thought I told you to stay inside.
  Tell me you didn't phone the hospital.
  No.
  Who then?
  I swear.
  Who?
I was going to. And then I didn't.
Get upstairs to your room.
  Honestly.
  Ben, now.
  We got a problem.
  What?
Ben, upstairs to your room, now, please.
Is that your idea of caring for the sick?
What's happened?
Iron's blew up.
You'll have to wear it as it is.
Phil, go easy on the kid.
I know what he did to Louise was out of order, but...
It's nothing to do with Louise.
Well, what is it then? Has something else happened?
  Just one simple thing, that's all I ask you to do, isn't it?
  What?
You can't even get that right, can ya? Just for once, you know,
you could do something right for a change, couldn't ya?
  Calm down!
  I want to see the doctor.
He's on his rounds, the nurse told you. You're overreacting.
She said 'unusual'. Jordan's injuries are unusual.
Not the injuries you'd expect with a simple accident.
  Woah, no listen.
  Meaning somebody hit him.
  She didn't say that.
  She didn't need to.
  Ssh. Shush.
So what you're really saying is that somebody crept up behind Jordan
when he was alone in the Arches
and they just smashed him over the head for no good reason? Who?
Phil? Minty? Ricky?
Or maybe you're talking about that local hard nut, Ben.
Lucas, you know, all that stuff earlier on, and now this,
you are just not thinking straight.
So let's just concentrate on what is really important.
And that is getting Jordan sorted.
And just forget about all the conspiracy theories.
Who's that from?
Doesn't say. And it doesn't recognise the number either.
Well, what's the message?
'Sorry'.
  He's probably just a bit wound up.
  Strung up more like.
I've been there, Hev. Lou, the Social Workers, Ben...
And what do I get? Shouted at over a poxy iron.
You're both close to getting what you want, bound to make you jumpy.
These are his kids, not mine.
But you want this residency thing just as much as Phil.
  Poor little cow'd be better off in care.
  You don't mean that.
With my track record with kids?
OK, so you've been a bit rubbish.
  Cheers, Hev.
  But that's what makes it more important, innit?
I mean, here's your chance to put things right and you can.
  Look at the amount of kids you're caring for already.
  D'you know what Deano said?
I know you didn't part on the best of terms.
What gives you that idea?
What, when he robbed me? No, that wasn't very pleasant.
When he beat me up? That wasn't very good either.
You know what he said?
He said, "Thank you for making me what I am."
Here we go.
Oh! What happened?
Favourite from the first race at Kempton came last.
And one of the punters didn't like it that much.
Er, why do I have to clear it up?
You ain't got anything else to do, have ya?
Where's Lucas? Up at the hospital?
  He'll be back.
  Yeah, and then what?
And then, I've just got a little bit of thinking to do.
I'm more into doing than thinking myself, Janine,
but talking of doing, yeah.
Look, I know you're on edge about today.
You're nervous.
But if you EVER talk to me like that again,
I'll knock you right out.
And it better be six, Liam, OK?
I don't want you coming back going,
"I was playing football, I lost track of time."
Liam gone out?
Playing football down the park with his mates.
So it's just me and you then.
Looks like it.
  You not seeing Zsa Zsa today?
  Who?
Oh, it's like that is it? Shame.
Why?
  Well, you and her.
  What?
Well, you...you know.
Have you been hearing wedding bells?
  Of course not.
  What is it with women?
  You see someone for a bit, and then they start thinking all sorts.
I thought you were well suited.
You can be well suited with a few people, why stick with one? Where's the fun in that?
Where's the fun in cheating?
I didn't say cheating. You see someone for a bit.
It ends. You see someone else. That's the way it works.
  But why's it have to end?
  Everything ends.
  You're so romantic.
  It's the way it is.
  Yeah, well not for everyone, Leon.
  Name me one couple...
just one...of people you know, who've stayed together, forever.
There's a first time for everything.
Like who?
Ricky and Bianca. They've stayed together for ages.
Yeah, let's be like Ricky and Bianca.
Meeting new people, it's what it's about.
Plus, Zsa Zsa don't want to know me anyway, that's that.
  And that don't bother you?
  What don't?
  Zsa Zsa.
It's ancient history.
Not all the good teams are gone.
You can still get Spain look, Portugal, Brazil.
You can still get the USA.
That'll be Darren and the boys from the market.
I told them to come over lunch time and join in the...fun.
All right? >
  Who got England?
  I did. >
  That's a fix.
  I think you'll find that's luck of the draw.
That's what me and Ben were just talking about.
What's happening, Ben, you all right?
  What's the matter with him?
  It's about what happened to Jordan, it's still playing on his mind.
Him and Jordan, they're top mates, aren't they.
  What, Jordan and Ben?
  What?
  Nothing, I just...
Mint, how did Ben get that bruise?
Anyway, I'd better get someone decent.
I don't want to end up with New Zealand or Korean Republic.
  Why isn't this open?
  Lucas, for heaven's sake.
It's a normal working day. Why is no one here?
  It's lunchtime.
  Maybe they don't want anyone seeing inside.
  You're doing it again.
  They're hiding something.
Off on one of your flights of fancy.
  Dee, the text said sorry. Why would whoever sent it then turn their phone off?
  Lucas please!
Sorry. I mean why would they say sorry? Is that what you would do?
  Yes.
  You'd say sorry for something you haven't done?
  Yes, I would and I have and you have too.
  What?
What do you do when you get bad news?
You say, I'm sorry. That's what you do. That's exactly what you do.
It doesn't mean you had anything to do with it, it doesn't mean that it's your fault.
"I'm sorry", you know, it's just something that you say.
About you husband, about your wife, your mum, your dad.
After Kevin,
I had so many people coming up to me, people I barely knew, boys off of the
market and they'd all say the same thing.
"I'm sorry."
Darling, it's just something you say.
Why can't we go to the Vic?
We've already ordered our grub from the caff.
Since when have we had to do that?
  We're only thinking of you.
  What's that mean?
So you won't be hanging around.
What with feeding for two and that.
Sometimes you gotta wait hours in this place.
  Not today, Mo.
  See?
There we go. Jean, Becca,
Mo, Stacey.
  What's that?
  Your order.
  I never ordered that.
  We did.
We thought the healthy option.
Healthy as you get in here anyway.
So while you lot have got chips and that, I've got rabbit food?
It's full of vitamins.
Might be a bit short on taste, but like I said, you're eating for two.
What, ain't you hungry?
No, I'm starving.
  Stace?
  Whoa, where you going with that?
  Where you going?
No, no, no, no!
Stace?
  What you doing?
  What I wanted to do since I first saw that thing.
And now I'm going to the Vic.
I was only keeping it warm for you.
Mo!
Mo!
Well, you'll be glad to know Darren did get the Korean Republic, and he is gutted.
You still thinking about Jordan?
Well, look, it's only natural.
I'd be worried if it was my mate and he was in hospital. Especially...
What?
Look, what your Dad said about kids mucking about, things happen.
It's true, you know.
I hit your dad with a cricket bat once, did you know that?
I didn't mean to, we was just mucking about, Next thing I know, he's on the deck.
If that weren't bad enough, your uncle Grant come over, took one look at him,
started laughing.
Then he looked up at me, and I thought, "Oh, my word, I'm in trouble now."
What happened?
Well, nothing happened.
Because like I said,
it was just an accident.
You know, a mate of mine used to do that.
  What?
  Sit in a caff all day.
  Nice caff was it?
  Well, she was living in this B&B.
This guy just chucked her out in the morning. Didn't let her come back till it was dark.
I'm not in no B&B. I've got myself a flat.
What? Round here?
Right, how'd you afford that?
  It's sort of free.
  Oh, you got yourself a fairy godmother, have you?
On George Street.
That's Ian Beale's flat?
It's empty. Why not? I mean he's not letting it to people.
  But how d'you know that?
  He's cut off the electricity.
Oh.
You should have seen me last night, trying to find my way round with a candle.
I was supposed to be revising.
For the exam I'm supposed to be in now. But what's the point? I was going to fail anyway.
That's exactly how I felt about mine.
  And?
  And then I did.
So what you living on, then?
I get by.
Some big shot businesswoman gave me some money at the weekend.
So I got myself a pizza.
Only my oven don't work.
  Oh, well, ours does.
  Cheers.
Ben, come on, pick a team.
Come and play.
Look, what I said about kids mucking about.
Accidents will happen. You know that, don't you?
This wasn't an accident, was it?
Did you mean to hit him, Ben?
He was laughing at me.
I was standing up for myself, just like...
Like your Dad told you. I can imagine.
I ain't going to win with a team like that.
  Darren.
  Everyone's waiting.
Just one minute, please.
Dad won't even let me find out how he is.
  He's just thinking of you.
  It's Jordan we should be thinking about.
He's the important one, isn't he?
I just want to do something.
Show him that I didn't mean it, not really.
Try and put things right.
Hurry up, Mint. >
  How's Jordan?
  Mum.
Why do you want to know?
  She was asking after him earlier as well.
  What's your game?
I'm not playing a game.
Look, I'm just interested.
Here...it's not much, but,
like my old dad used to say, no matter how bad things get,
they always seem better after a raspberry nut cluster.
Sit down, I'll get it.
You've gotta have ketchup, eh.
She's in the caff.
  Who?
  Your girlfriend. She was going on about you last night.
  What, Mo?
  Something about you and a film star.
She reckons I look like Burt Reynolds, whoever he was.
I told her you look more like James Dean.
  Yeah?
  After the crash.
  Stace, did I run over your dog or something?
  What?
There's got to be some reason why you're giving me a hard time.
  Call this hard?
  We started off all right from what I remember.
I know that was a few months ago
and how hard things have been for you with Bradley.
Why are we talking about this?
It's playing on my mind. What happened?
What changed?
  I'm winding you up.
  Seems a bit more than a wind up to me.
Oh, sit down and have a chip.
Yeah, all right. Don't mind if I do.
Sliding tackle, come on.
Where's Ben?
In the kitchen. I think.
Ben? >
I just saw you pull up, what happened?
  Well, we got the residency order.
  Ben?
Oh, that's great.
Not that you'll see Face Ache doing much celebrating.
  Ben's not upstairs.
  I've just seen him down the shops.
What's he doing there? He's not well. I told him to stay in.
He looked OK. Shirl, do you want to hear my news?
  Well, where is he now?
  Stacey Branning tried to stab me.
  I said, where is he now?
I'm here. I've just been for a walk.
In the kitchen, come on.
Did you hear what I said, Shirl? She actually came at me with a knife.
What are you going to do? You can't kip in a place with no leccie.
  Are you offering to put me up?
  Oh, just move in, mate, there's oceans of space here.
Take the west wing, why don't you?
Actually, I was wondering about Zsa Zsa.
  Come on, you do miss her?
  You having a laugh?
How about you and Billie?
  You going to miss him?
  We ain't split up.
  When he goes off to the army?
  I'll survive.
Will he?
  That's not funny.
  Miss you?
What makes you say that?
  Well, it's his choice isn't it, going away.
  Yeah, it's his job.
If you say so.
Of course he's going to miss me.
I mean, he rings all the time as it is.
He hasn't called me today because he's off training and that, but...
Have you finished with your pizza?
Cos I've gotta get the supper on for the kids.
I know it's not going to be easy.
Him away, you here, all by yourself.
Yeah.
Ask me, I think he's mad.
Yeah, well, like I said, it's his job.
I wouldn't.
No, Leon!
  I knew you'd done too much.
  Oh, I'm fine.
Look at you, you can hardly keep your eyes open.
  That's cos I don't want to look at you.
  If you're fine, I'm a Chinaman.
Oh, go on. You say something and all.
Actually, I think Mo's wrong.
  What?
  You look fine to me.
Oh.
Maybe we've all been fussing over nothing.
Point proved, Stacey, you are someone who can stand
out on that stall all day, every day, until you pop.
Yeah, I can.
So now you've proved your point, you got nothing left to prove, have you?
  What do you mean?
  Well, if you wanted to take a bit of time off,
or go in late tomorrow, you could,
and it wouldn't be because you were resting, or on maternity leave, it would be your choice.
Wouldn't it?
Actually I might go in late tomorrow
but that's not cos you lot were right, or cos I've done too much.
No. It would be your choice. Like I said.
Yeah.
All right, Mint.
  How's he been?
  Who?
You know, he's been worried sick all morning in court.
He could barely concentrate on what the brief was telling us.
Yeah, well, Ben's been a bit jumpy too.
Did he talk to you?
A bit.
I know Phil told him not to, but...
he couldn't help himself. He's wracked with guilt.
  That's understandable, I suppose.
  Yeah.
It's bad enough for Ben, I mean, he did hit Jordan with a spanner.
I mean, he could die.
Right.
Why don't I make us all some food and...then why don't you say grace?
  Look, I know we don't always see the point, but today of all days.
  Yeah.
Yeah, course.
Lucas, come on, hang in there.
Give it a few more days, everything'll be fine, it'll get back to normal.
Look, someone must have dropped him a get well card.
See, everyone's been asking about him.
  Everywhere today, in the market and the caff.
  Even Janine.
I know, how weird was that?
  I should have told you.
  Why didn't you?
Because I had Ben to sort out, a court case to deal with.
No, you didn't trust me.
I wasn't thinking straight.
I was going to tell you when Ben had gone to bed, but for now,
I wanted as few people knowing as possible.
Well, Minty knew.
Minty'll keep his mouth shut, I'll make sure he does.
You'd better keep quiet and all.
You think I'm going to blab this all over the Square?
Right then. So, who's it from then?
  Ben.
  Oh, that's nice.
OK, plates.
