Take care and see you tomorrow. Evening all.
Welcome to our final Today at Conference with the Conservative
Party, here in Birmingham, where David Cameron took to the stage to
vision of the Big Society with a cry which echoed old wartime
recruiting posters: Your Country Needs You.
He claimed the Tories were the radicals now and promised a massive
shift in power from the state to the people. It was not his best
conference performance and the reception wasn't rapturous but he
sent the faithful away with an unbeat message that there was more
I want to tell you today, in the clearest terms that I can, what we
must do together, and we can achieve together. First, we should
remember where we've come from. Three defeats. 13 party conferences.
4,757 days in the wilderness. You remember all the things they said
about us? They even called us, a dead parrot. That we had ceased to
be. We were an exparty. It does turn out we were actually only
And, here we are, back serving our country, together in the national
interest. Giving Britain the good strong, solid government that she
deserves and so needs. I will never forget the night of May 6th.
Watching those results coming in. The Tories back in the North,
winning in Wales. Sweeping across West Yorkshire. Taking seats we
hadn't won in decades. Carlisle, Cannock, Thurrock. The end of a
Labour government that had done so much harm. I know there are a few
who say we should have sat tight. We should have waited for our owe
pontopbts fall out and brought in a minority government. A minority
government would have limped through Parliament, unable to do
anything useful for our country. The voters left us with a hung
Parliament, and they wanted us to respond responsibly. To do the
right thing. Not to play political games. So, I set out to form a
strong and stable coalition government. I want to thank Nick
Clegg for what he did. Nick Clegg is not sitting in government,
trying to win a few concessions here and there. The Liberal
Democrats are proper partners, getting stuck in. Making big
decisions. Shaping what we do and taking responsibility. That's why
we formed a proper government. That's why, I think, you can be
really proud of what we've done. What can a coalition government
really achieve? I would say, just look today at what we are achieving
already.   together, in the national interest. Conservative
policies, policies you campaigned on. Policies that we're delivering.
200 in Academies, 10,000 university places. 50,000 apprenticeships.
Corporation tax cut. The jobs tax, axed, police targets, smashed.
Immigration, capped. The third runway stopped. Home information
packs, dropped. Fat cat salaries, revealed. ID cards abillionished
the NHS protected. Our aid promise kept. Quangos coming down. Cancer
drug fund up and running. Â£6 billion saved of spending this year.
Emergency budget to balance the books in five years. EU referendum
lock to protect our sovereign powers every year. For our
pensioners, the earnings linked restored. For our entrepreneurers,
employee tax reduced. For our braved armed forces the operational
allowance doubled. Look what we've done in five months, just imagine
what we can do in five years. We are not in Afghanistan to build the
perfect democracy. No dreamy ideas. Just hard headed national security,
pure and simple. But we will not stay a day longer than we need to.
British combat forces will not remain in Afghanistan after 2015.
Let a message go out, from this conference, from this Hall today,
for those who have served. For those who bear the scars. For those
who will never come home, this country has gratitude beyond words
for your service and your sacrifice. I will take no risks with British
security. That's why... That is why, when more and more
countries have, or want nuclear weapons, we will always keep our
ultimate insurance policy. We will renew the nuclear deterrent, based
on the Trident missile system. But however different life has got
as Prime Minister, there is one thing, for me, that has stayed
absolutely the same, my belief about how this country needs to
change. I think we should start with being honest with yourselves.
The mess this country is in, it is not all because of labour. Of
course, they must take some of the blame. All right, actually they
should take really quite a lot of the blame. In fact, let me just get
this off my chest. They left us with massive debts, the highest
deficit, over stretched armed forces, demoralised public services.
Endless rules regulations and bureaucracy and nonsense. The point
I really want to make is this. The state of our nation is not just
determined by the Government and those who run it. It is determined
by millions of individual actions, by what each of us do, and what we
choose not to do. Yes, they centralised too much. Laib Labour
told people they could fix every problem. It was the rest of us who
swallowed it. Hoping that if Government took care of things,
perhaps, we wouldn't have to. Too many people thought, I've paid my
taxes, the State will just look after everything. But, citizenship,
citizenship is not a transaction, in which you put your taxes in and
get your services out. It's a relationship. You are part of
something bigger than yourself. It matters what you think, and you
feel and you do. So, to get out of the mess that we're in. Changing
the Government is not enough. We need to change the way we think
about ourselves and our role in society. Your country needs you.
Now, the Big Society is not about creating cover for cuts. I was
going on about it years before the cuts. It's not about Government
abdicating its role, it's about Government changing it's role.
About government helping to build a nation of doers and go getters.
Where people step forward, not sit back. Where people come together,
to make life better. Now, of course, the cynics and defeatists will say
this cannot be done. We are struck in an inevitable society social
decline. That is what they said in the 1970s. They were wrong then, we
can prove them wrong again. We can. We can build a country, defined not
by the selfishness of the Labour years, but by the values of mutable
responsibility that this party holds dear. Over the coming months,
we will need this spirit, as we face up to the deficit, and our
financial responsibilities. Everybody knows this Government is
understaking    undertaking a programme of spending cuts. I know
how anxious people are. Yes, they say, of course, we need to cut
spending, but do we have to cut now, and by this much? Is there another
way? I wish there was another way. I wish there was an easier way, but
I have to tell you, there is no other responsible way. Now,
reducing spending will be difficult. There are programmes that will be
cut. There are jobs that will be lost. There are things the
Government does today, that it will have to stop doing. Many Government
departments will have their budgets cut, on average by 25%, over four
years. That is a cut, each year, of around 7%. Of course, that is big.
But let's remember a lot of businesses have had to make the
same, or bigger savings, in recent years. When we are done with these
cuts, spending on public services will still be at the same level
that it was in 2006. The spending cuts we do have to make will make,
in a way, that is fair. As we work to balance the budget, fairness
does mean asking asking those on higher incomes to shoulder more of
the burden than those on lower incomes. Ien I'm not saying it is
going to be easy. As we have seen this week with child benefit. It is
fair that those with broader shoulders should bear a greater
load. I think, I do think, it is time for a new conversation about
what fairness really means. Here's what I think. Yes, fairness means
giving money to help the poorest in our society. People who are sick.
Who are vulnerable, the elderly. I want you to know, we will always
look after you. That is the sign of a civilised society. It's what I
believe. But you cannot measure fairness just by how much money we
spend on welfare. As though the poor are products with a price tag,
the more we spend, the more we value them. Fairness means
supporting people out of poverty, not trapping them into dependency.
We will make a bold choice. For too long we have measureed success in
tackling poverty by the size of the cheque that we give people. We say,
let us measure our success by the chance that we give. Let's support
the real roots out of poverty. A strong family a good education, a
job. So, we will invest in the early years. Help put troubled
families back on track. Use a pupil premium to make sure kids from the
poorest homes go to the best schools, not the worst. Recognise
marriage in the tax system. Make sure that work really pays for
every single person in our country. So, mine is not just a vision of a
more powerful country. It is a vision of a more powerful people.
The knowledge in the heart of everyone, everyone, that they are
not captive to the circumstances of their birth. They are not in the
currents of wealth and power. They are not small people, but big
citizens. We will play our part. The part you play will be even more
meaningful. You're country needs you. I know the British people,
they are not passengers, they are drivers. I've seen the courage of
our soldiers, the spirit of our entrepreneurs, the patience of our
teachers and and the dedication of our doctors, the passion of our
careworkers, the wisdom of the elderly. Hopes of our children.
Let's pull together. Let's come together. Let's work together in
the national interest. The Prime Minister. He wanted us to
know that the cuts would be fair and that if we all shared the pain,
we'd all benefit from the gain. But it was the Big Society, on which he
dwelt most. When I spoke to the Foreign Secretary, William Hague,
after the speech, I began by asking Mr Hague why the emphasis on the
Big Society, when no one understood it during the election campaign?
The Prime Minister has a passionate conviction and a passionate vision
of the future of this country which he expressed in that speech. Which
is about a Big Society. That's not just about volunteering in your
local   it is about that, it's about setting up businesses and
taking part in every way. I think he brought it out in the speech.
Everything we do anyway? Taking part   What does it cover? Being
part of your community. Being active in setting up businesses.
About the activities of millions of people. Not everybody joins in in
that in this country. We want to change that, and free them up to do
that. Give local councils greater freedom and people more control
over their local police force. Afghanistan, he said,, "combat
force also not stay beyond 2015" no. Ifs, no buts, no caveats added. We
are gone by 12015. No, there are no ifs and buts. We will not have
combat forces engaged in combat   Even if the situation is
deteriorating? 2014 being able to lead and sustain   We are out. Even
if the Tam ban is rampant in the We won't be there in 2015
conducting combat operations. That is a clear message to all involved
that that is our plan and that is a very clear message. Have you
squared that with the Americans? There is no problem with any of our
allies about that. The pledge to renew Trident   can you give us a
clear indication of when this renewal will take place?
precisely. We are still conducting the Strategic Defence and Security
Review. We are committed to Trident. The Prime Minister and I, and the
Defence Secretary, have all repeated that at this conference.
We have always said we will scrutinise it for value for money.
So that does affect the actual date on which you build the first of
the... We don't know when that will start? The design work goes on.
you surprised by the way this conference got hijacked by the
child benefit issue? You had three days of negative headlines in the
Conservative press? I remember surveys have shown people are quite
supportive and we went up... doesn't affect them? I'm not sure
"hijacked" is the right description. There are other welfare reforms to
come. There are other important announcements to make so if people
have understood that we mean it on changing these things, that that
does mean we will all have to make a contribution, including the
higher rate taxpayers. If people have got that message, fine.
things get worse before they get better? We have a lot of difficult
problems to sort out. I hope people will be very supportive of sorting
out those problems. The Prime Minister mentioned the defence
budget, the thing that had most shocked him as Prime Minister   and
I'm sitting in on the same meetings   was how the outgoing Government
left the defence budget. Have you been involved, as Foreign Secretary,
as I understand it, we are being told the defence cuts must go hand
in hand with the aim of our foreign policy and goals of this country in
the 21st Century, have you been involved in this defence review at
the heart? Absolutely. This is a big change, that Cabinet Government
has been reinvented. It is David Cameron's natural inclination
anyway. A coalition has reinforced that anyway. We set up the National
Security Council. He and I, the Defence Secretary, the Chancellor,
the Energy and Home Secretaries, we all sit together looking at our
international relations. That is a big improvement in how Government
works. Are you satisfied   and I know you can't tell me   are you
satisfied the defence review and the inevitable cuts will leave us
with the Armed Forces that can meet our foreign policy goals? We are
still making the decisions. I see. Whatever we decide, we will still
have one of the largest defence budgets in the world, an
independent nuclear deterrent, formidable intelligence agencies,
armed forces that can be deployed around the globe. We will have what
is necessary. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, confirming the
scale and size of the defence cuts is yet to be decided. The Ministry
of Defence has fought a fierce battle with the Treasury and 10
Downing Street over these cuts. It's left a lot of blood on the
carpets and walls of Whitehall as a result. Liam Fox mentioned none of
that when he spoke this morning. Not a day has passed since my
appointment when I have not felt truly honoured to be working with
the men and women of our Armed Forces and those who support them.
If we are looking for role models in our Big Society, we need look no
further than our Armed Forces and their families. Now as
everyone knows it is not an easy time to be at the Ministry of
Defence. You should see what Labour left behind. The main focus for all
of us is naturally Afghanistan. We haven't always had it right in
Afghanistan and mistakes have been made along the way. We now have the
right strategy in place. Our objective is to have a stable
enough Afghanistan, able to manage its own internal and external
security so that the international community can leave without the
fear of creating a security vacuum. The training of the Afghan security
forces is on track and ahead of schedule. That is why British
troops will not have a combat role after 2015. But while Afghanistan
is our main priority, it cannot be our only priority. As the Prime
Minister has repeatedly said, the first duty of Government is the
defence of the realm. That is why we will maintain Britain's nuclear
deterrent and will go ahead with the Trident replacement programme.
The country's finances are wrecked and never has a defence
review been carried out in such extreme circumstances. We know
about Labour's toxic economic legacy. Now, I didn't come into
politics wishing to see a reduction in our defence budget. Neither did
the Prime Minister. New Labour was the most short sighted, self 
serving, incompetent, useless and ineffective Government this country
has ever known. Make no mistake   Labour's economic
policies were a national security liability. Now over the last few
weeks, you will all have seen that the newspapers have been full
during the defence review of stories about the number of tanks,
the number of planes and other equipment programmes. But it is our
people, the men and women of our Armed Forces, who are our greatest
asset. Without them, there is no defence of the realm. My
colleague has done a wonderful job looking at ways that we can improve
mental healthcare for those in our Armed Forces and our veterans. We
will be taking forward work on the proposals, but due to the urgency
of the issue I am pleased to announce that we will put into
place two key recommendations immediately. A dedicated 24 hour
support line for veterans and introducing 30 dedicated mental
health nurses in Mental Health Trusts to ensure the right support
is organised specifically for veterans. I can also
announce new funding to replace 125 service family accommodation units
at Bulford with 260 new family units at a cost of Â£47 million. It
is not much   and I wish I could do more   but it is a step in the
right direction to do what we all wish, which is to have better
accommodation for our service personnel and their families.
Whatever the frustrations, and whatever the difficulties, I am
determined that no future Defence Secretary will inherit the shambles
that I inherited from Labour in May and that our national security will
take its proper place in the country's political priorities. So
to all those who serve in our Armed Forces, or who have served in our
Armed Forces, and those families who support them, I have a simple
message from all of us to all of you: Thank you. We will never let
you down. Liam Fox. This conference hasn't exactly gone to
plan. Party managers never expected it to be hijacked by a row over
child benefits. Sayeeda Warsi is the Chairman of the Conservative
Party so I asked her whose bright idea had it been to use the
conference to knock the aspiring middle classes. I don't think there
has been an attack, this Conservative Conference has been
about acknowledging the state that the country is in and making some
difficult decisions. I have enjoyed it because most Party Chairman end
up with a conference where there is back biting and crazy announcements,
when this has all been about a serious conference making some
serious and difficult announcements because we are acknowledging the
state of the country's finances. Did you foresee the coverage of
your conference for three days running would be dominated by child
benefits? You could never foresee what the coverage is going to be.
You can never work out what you guys are going to focus on.
decision to end the principle of universal benefits, how long was
the debate in the Cabinet about that? There is no way I would ever
tell you what goes on in Cabinet. There is no way I would ever tell
you what goes on in Cabinet. can't tell us whether that was
debated or not, a principled change in policy like that? I have a very
simple rule   I would never discuss with you what I discuss in Cabinet.
When were you told about the change? I will never discuss with
you... I know, I know you will not telling the viewers, I know it
wasn't discussed in Cabinet. Can you tell us when you were told
about the change in child benefits? These discussions have been going
on for a long time. These were going on before the general
election as to what we would be doing. These discussions are
happening after the general election. These discussions were
part... Why did Lib Dem Ministers tell us that child benefits would
stay universal? That is a matter for you to address with Lib Dem
colleagues. You have told us these discussions have been going on
inside the Government for some time so why didn't the Lib Dems know?
What I can say to you is that these are serious discussions   if you
look at the work that Iain Duncan Smith has been doing, if you look
at the work that the Centre for Social Justice has been doing...
There have been serious discussions about how we deal with welfare
reform. Part of this is all about welfare reform. When we make tough
decisions about the economy, and the state of our economy, everybody
shoulders that burden and that includes those on higher incomes.
Is it true that your party's membership has fallen by a third
since David Cameron became leader? Party involvement in association
with the party has gone up. Party membership? Has it fallen since
David Cameron became leader? have different levels of
association and membership within the party. You have friends,
supporters... Let's take the straightforward member of the
Conservative Party, a card carrying member. Has that risen or fallen?
don't think that is the way that we measure our involvement with the
Conservative Party. You don't know how many members you have? I could
how many members your party has? don't assess association with the
Conservative Party purely in terms of card holding members. If you
look... You don't know? If you look at the way in which people engage
with the Conservative Party, we have friends, we have associates,
we have people who volunteer, we have activists, campaigners and
members. I can tell you very clearly that since David Cameron
has been leader of the Conservative Party, associations and abgtivifss
within the Conservative Party, friend    activists within the
Conservative Party, friends, have all gone up. Can you tell me
whether your party membership has fallen? How are you defining
membership? An ordinary card  carrying membership of the
Conservative Party, who paid their constituency dues, has that number
fallen or risen, you are the Chairman of your party, you should
know and you should be able to tell us? I can tell you clearly, as I
have told you before, that people getting involved with the
Conservative Party has increased under David Cameron. And that is it,
not just from Birmingham, but for the party conference season of 2010.
We have shown with the Lib Dems in Liverpool how they love to be back
in power after all that time, but anguished over having to share it
with the Conservatives. We reported from Manchester how Labour rallied
around its new leader, but wondered if it had chosen the right brother.
And we have explained here in Birmingham how a Tory Conference
meant to stress "together in the national interest" ended up
