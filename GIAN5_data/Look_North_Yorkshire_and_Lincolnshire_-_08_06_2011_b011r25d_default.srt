Good evening. The headlines this Wednesday: He warm is a name as one
of the best places to bike to work.    Hull. But critics say that
safety needs improving. You just have to deal with it and move on.
This man's girlfriend is charged with fizz a murder.    with his
murder. And the swirl making a new home in Bridlington.    squirrel.
And for the weather details join me in 15 minutes.
It has been named as one of the best places in the country to bike
to work. Research shows that the number of people who cycle to work
in Hull is three times the national average. But last year on the
city's roads there were nearly 200 accidents involving cyclists and it
is claimed safety needs improving. We have been finding out what it is
like out on the roads. Both busy roads, high speeds, impatient
motorists. This man is one of the growing number of commuters
choosing to cycle to work. It was mainly due to petrol prices. It was
suggest that 12 % of commuters in Hull cycle to work. That is three
times the national average despite the Government's spending millions
trying to persuade us all to get on a bicycle. But how safe is it to
cycle in Hull? Police here have told us that there were 171
accidents involving cyclists last year. One woman died when this load
fell onto her from a lorry that was carrying it. We want to create more
awareness among pedestrians and car users to be aware of who they are
sharing the road with. There are drivers who turn their nose up at
you sometimes but you have to deal with it and move on. Hall's
flatness makes it perfect for bikes.    Hull's flatness. Car ownership
is low as well. This could be why Hull is a biting them town. We have
been investing heavily in infrastructure. There are 65
kilometres of off road cycling lain here. Hull might beat other cities
but some say that until the cycle lanes are completely segregated
they will stick to their cars. Our correspondent is in Hull City
Centre this evening. Are we likely to see more and more people getting
on their bikes? Most probably yes we will force up    most probably
we will. There will be some proficiency rides that are opening
up just for women which will encourage them to drive safely.
They are only open to women because statistics suggest that is their   
if there is an accident involving a cyclist it is most likely a woman.
What is it like cycling where you live? Is Hull better than other
towns and cities? Get in touch and tell us what you think needs to be
done to improve the roads for In a moment: The woman abandoned as
a baby is now offering help to desperate mothers.
The partner of a man who was killed after being locked in a cupboard
and his workshop set on fire has been charged with his murder. Julie
Dixon appeared in court to face the accusation nearly three months
after David Twigg died at his business in Burgh le Marsh near
Skegness. Our reporter is in the village this evening. Just remind
us of the background. It was a sunny evening back in
March when police and fire officers were called here. Just behind me
you can see the workshop of a local joiner who was called David Twigg.
He was discovered in a cupboard and a fire was also on the premises. He
died from inhaling smoke. Officers said they were treating his death
as murder and they were looking for two male intruders who they thought
might have started the fire. David Twigg was a popular member of the
community and his killing caused a shock to the community of Burgh le
Marsh. There was even a �3,000 reward for information. 43 year old
Julie Dixon, his ex partner, has been charged. She was at Boston
magistrates' court this morning and she has also been at Lincoln Crown
Court where she appeared before judges. I am afraid we have lost
the link with our reporter. The case will resume later in August.
The Prime Minister has promised to meet with a task force about job
losses at Tata Steelworks in Scunthorpe. Last month the company
announced the loss of up to 1,200 jobs at the site. Now David Cameron
says he has spoken to the company about the future of the plant.
spoke personally to the companies about this. These companies are
interested in investing hundreds of millions of pounds in this country.
We must do everything we can to bring this task force together
which I know is something my secretaries are working on.
Firefighters have had to put out a blaze at one of their own fire
stations in Epworth. An investigation is now underway into
the cause of the fire which damaged parts of the building and the fire
cover is now being provided by a replacement engine.
It is estimated that at least one baby a week is found abandoned
somewhere in the UK. Many of them aren't found in time to save them.
But a woman from Wawne in East Yorkshire is hoping to change that.
Alley Lofthouse was dumped on a doorstep just hours after being
born. She's just launched a new website to support both those who
were abandoned and the mothers who feel forced to just leave their
baby. Time spent with your children is
precious for any mother but moments like these have an added poignancy
for this woman because she was abandoned by her mother when she
was just hours old. When I was found I was bleeding. I still had
baby new kiss. I was giving birth at you and taking away.    baby new
kiss. Now a website has been set up for mothers and the children who
are abandoned. I can go for information on this website. It is
a point for families to go through. The Ollie thing that she has
discovered about her mother    only thing that she discovered about her
mother was that she also had another child that she left on a
doorstep. It was a boy. The story made headlines. Up to 1,000 babies
a year were simply discarded in London alone. While the numbers of
children abandoned has reduced every the years, research has shown
that many will suffer some of the same problems. We can tell that it
is likely to have psychological effects on identity and self esteem
as well as attachment problems in relationships. It is estimated that
at least one baby in the UK is abandoned every week. Many do not
survive. Last year a funeral was fact    held for a baby who was
left at a dump site. His mother was never found. Three babies died last
year and reading these stories one after the other makes me think that
something must be done. believes that women    women should
be able to abandon their babies in safety and without fear of
persecution. The journalist Kate Adie has
written a book about foundlings. She told me women feel forced into
abandoning babies. Most of the women that I have come across, and
it has been quite a number of them, are people who are in desperate
situations. They are in fear for their lives or had seen no other
alternative. It is the last decision they take. They have
looked at any other possibility and they abandon. One of the reason
these children are called foundlings is because they are
abandoned to be found. This is very different from leaving a baby to
die. These are foundlings. trouble is that the lady in our
film earlier knew of the three babies who died because they were
not found in time. Partly because of the state their mothers are in.
They might be demented with grief and worry and fear. The problem is
also that it is a crime in this day and age to abandon a child under
the age of two. This was a law brought in by the Victorians who
thought that women who abandoned children's did it because they felt
like it    children did it because they felt like it and did not take
life very seriously. That was the attitude. Women were not considered
to be as intelligent as men and they were criminalised. It was
scandalous and it is still scandalous that this is the case.
It is very different abroad. There are many countries that now have a
very intelligent and Modern Review with how to deal with these
desperate situations. In America and there is a safe haven project
and in other European countries there are places designated where
you can leave a child safely where it will be automatically found.
Would you like to see a mother be able to give birth safely and be
able to leave their baby and walk away? We do not have many cases,
maybe 20 or 30 a year, but there is a stream that is being increased by
a number of women, mainly ethnic minorities, who are in fear for
their lives when they become pregnant. They have run foul of the
idea that they should not be pregnant. I think it should be
decriminalised and the hands should    issue should be moved into the
hands of people who are used to this thing and that way if women
but they were not going to be decriminalised or they could tell
social workers about this and relinquish a baby to them then the

The headline for the next 20 hours is a bright and breezy one.
Tomorrow, a few showers around. Low pressure still in charge of Our
weather. It looks like they could be some useful rainfall developing.
The low pressure will develop out to the West and it could bring in
showers and even chances of longer spells of rain for farmers. The
satellite shows well broken cloud. Basically, just fleeting showers.
Any showers will die away. The night time period, drily with clear
spells. We will see temperatures drifting back to about seven
Celsius. The sun rises in the morning. Her we should get off to a
bright start. Variable cloud and sunny spells. A risk of one or two
showers, lighter than today. Many places will stay dry. A blustery
west wind. Temperatures just a shade down on average. The best
temperatures across central and eastern parts of Lincolnshire.
Looking further ahead, Friday looks like a shower every day. Some of
those showers heavy. A risk of thunder. Similar forecast for
Saturday. Sunday, a bright start. Very changeable. We have had a
request for a grey line to be added to make the map the correct shape.
It will create hundreds of jobs and power hundreds of thousands of
homes and it is just the beginning. Triton Knoll windfarm is just one
of many proposed for the North Sea. The plans to build it off
Lincolnshire are being discussed at towns along the coast throughout
June and July. They say it is the answer to meeting our green energy
needs. It is claimed plans to build up to 333 giant wind turbines like
these off the Lincolnshire coast will power 850,000 homes and boost
the local economy. We are estimating around 300 jobs during
the construction phase. It could be more than that, it depends on
manufacturing coming to the region. So we know the energy is produced
at sea but there's still the question of connecting it to the
land after plans to build a substation just up the coast were
rejected by the public. I do not object to the wind farm development.
But we have to object to the industrialisation of the coastline
or the industrialisation of the countryside. This is just a start
of the East Coast role in the push for green energy. This map shows
all the offshore windfarms being planned including three huge ones
Dogger Bank, Hornsea and East Anglian. Like today's, they will
all need to be plugged into the National Grid, meaning more pylons
and substations. If we at to delay and wait for a decision, we would
lose a couple of years and that is a couple of years of jobs and
renewable electricity was a bad is not something we should be doing.
You'll only get a glimpse of the tear binds on a clear day. Despite
that, not everyone is convinced. What is the alternative? They look
nice. I think they look nice. It is something for children to look at.
Despite these concerns, many businesses will welcome this
development. There are already plans to build turbines on the
Humber and this along with more windfarms and substations could
make the East Coast the country's green energy centre.
A few minutes ago, I spoke to Maria McCaffrey from Renewable UK. I
asked her how significant these offshore windfarms will be.
east coast of England and the south east coast of England
collectively will account for two  thirds of all the offshore wind
that is planned. All the offshore wind that is planned will give us
between 20 and 25% of our electricity supply. Is it worth
people saying what they think in the consultation process? Will it
make a difference? We would actively encourage people to take
part. But it will happen anyway? has in the past prevented wind
farms going ahead or it has arranged for them to be resited.
We're not seeing any reason why local communities regarding these
projects should have any reason to object. But they all have to be
plugged into the National Grid and there are fears this will lead to
our countryside being plastered by pylons. Why should we forfeit our
countryside so the government can reach its renewable target? We need
electricity and we need a new grade. That is whether or not we have
renewable energy. At least with offshore wind, we have huge
economic benefits that come along with that as well as securing a
green and sustainable energy supply. You could put the cables
underground? That is an option that but it is being considered. But my
understanding, which is not perfect, but I understand it is about 10
times the price. Ultimately, the electricity consumer would have to
bear the cost of that. His win the answer for the future? It most
definitely is the answer for the future of. We need to make it
clearly understood whether we have a renewable energy on not we need a
new grade. Thank you. Thanks to everyone who got in touch
about our story on how much it will cost to clear the region's roads of
potholes. Lincolnshire County Council says it needs $300 million
to repair all the county's roads.     �300 million. In all my years
working as a driving instructor, we have never had it so bad. There has
been a lot of problems and we have to make sure everything is safe.
Here are just some of your comments. Geoff in Gainsborough says, 'While
potholes may be a financial inconvenience to motorists, they
are potentially dangerous and cause serious injury to cyclists.'
Caroline in Grimsby asks, 'Where has all the money gone that is
generated through road tax? Is it being used on other projects?'
And David tweeted to say, 'There is no great science to this. Just fill
the potholes with the appropriate tarmac, concrete and road surface
filling.' It has taken 18 months to construct,
but today, the keys to a �20  million leisure centre were handed
over to North Lincolnshire Council. The Pods are hoped to become an
iconic structure in Scunthorpe. But they may come to symbolise the last
big expenditure for the town. Bubbling up on the Scunthorpe
Skyline is �21 million worth of new leisure facilities and today as the
keys were handed over to the council we got our first proper
glimpse inside the Pods. Here we are in the entrance Dome. It is
light, bright and airy. You can go into the heart of the pack. Most
normal community swimming pools would have a six lane 20 metre pool.
We have added an extra two lanes to better support local competition
and give us more flexibility. the council took this project on
board, it was keen to look at the a regeneration of the airier and
deliver an iconic flagship project. That is what we have achieved. The
Pods are a one off in terms of leisure centre design, with nothing
else like it in the country. And that's had it's own construction
hurdles. It is unlikely that we will be involved do something like
this again in our lifetime. It is an extremely good looking building.
The Pods open to the public in early July and will bring a huge
boost to a town that faces hard times ahead. We're yet to see
whether future leisure services will be affected when the new
council sets its budget at the end of the month. But one thing is
guaranteed, we won't see investment on this scale for many more years
