Tree Fu Tom, join the fun Come along now, everyone
Move with Tom, he needs you
To save the day and do Tree Fu, yeah!
I wonder what the surprise is that Ariela wants us to see.
I don't know, but it must be important
because she said to get over here now!
Ariela can be so impatient sometimes. C'mon, Tom! Hurry up!
Step right up, step right up, and see the amazing Zigzoo Zippyocitor!
  Wow.
  Ooh, fancy.
  What does it do?
Well, my new crop here takes a long time to grow.
And if there's one thing I'm hatin', it's waitin'!
So I made this machine especially for Ariela,
to speed things up a bit!
Ooh, with magic sap in here, a beam of music comes out here
that will make Ariela's plants grow zippy fast!
We can adjust the speed of the music to get the perfect growing speed.
With Zigzoo's Zippyocitor
I'll be able to grow and harvest my plants all in the same day!
Really? But doesn't nature need time for things to grow?
Oh, nature's just a big ol' slowpoke, if you ask me!
Let's test it out, Zigzoo!
This looks brilliant,
but you never know what could happen with Zigzoo's inventions!
We need to do the moves to turn our magic powers on! Come on, join in!
Time for Tree Fu!
We need to turn the magic on We need to save the day, come on
Just follow me and you will see The magic comes from you and me
To make Tree Fu spells do what you see
Slide to the side
And jump right back
Hold your hands up high
Spin around, reach up for the sky
Touch your nose, now make a pose
Clap your hands
Touch your knees and run with me
When you move you make the magic
Do what I do to make the magic
Turn that, turn that, turn that, turn that Tree Fu magic on!
Look! The sapstone in my belt is glowing! Moving turned our magic on!
Thanks for your help.
Now we're ready if Zigzoo's zippy music invention goes wrong.
Let's see what it does.
Whoa!
  It's growing!
  It works!
Ooh! Catchy beat!
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Look at me go. Ha hey.
Thanks, but can your zippy thing make my plant grow even faster?
Oh, of course, I suppose turning the speed up a little would be OK,
but we have to be careful   too fast and who knows what will happen!
Wow! By the end of the day this plant'll be all grown up
and ready for harvest!
Yeah, I s'pose. But it's still slow as a snail stuck in sticky syrup,
as far as I'm concerned.
  Let me turn the speed up a bit more.
  I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Come on, let's get zippy with it! Hee hee. This is great!
Don't worry. A little speedin' up... never hurt any...
  Whoa! Get back! It's gone crazy!
  You've broken it! It's too fast!
Oh, no!
Look at that magic machine, Puffy!
Yeah! Hee hee! I smell mischief, Stink!
  No, I think that's just smoke.
Oh.
That is so cool!
But so wrong.
  Twigs, I think we need to stop it...
  Oh! Oh!
Twigs! This is no time to dance!
Tell my legs that! Oh! I can't stop!
Oh, oh, hey, oh! Oh!
  Zigzoo, your wacky machine has got Twigs all speeded up too!
  But...
Don't blame Zigzoo! You were the one who made the music go faster!
OK, let's not argue! It's time to take action!
Yeah, and quick! I'm getting really tired!
  Time for Tree Fu?
  Actually, no magic needed.
It's called pressing the "off" switch.
MUSIC SLOWS AND STOPS Oh... Thank you, Tom.
  Hey, will you look at those beauties?
  Wow, giant fruit!
  Harvest time, y'all.
  Ah!
Woo hoo hoo! Yummy!
Let's grab that music thing when they're gone!
Hey, that was my idea! Hmm!
I can't wait to use your Zippyocitor on ALL my crops, Zigzoo!
Er... I think it would be best to wait
until it cools down a bit first, though.
Wait? But the whole point of this thing is so I don't have to wait!
  Get the music playin'!
  Er...
  I don't think that's such a good idea.
That should do it! Come on! Where's the music?
I ain't waitin' round for that too!
Ooh, er, no, oh, no, no, Ariela!
  Now that's more like it!
  Wow!
Wowzers! Lots and lots of giant fruit.
Er, I don't think that's very safe. Um, the plant is growing too fast.
Oooh! We could cause all sorts of mischief with that thing!
Yeah. I got three words for you.
Slime. Weeds... Um, yeah...
Whoa! Hey, stop that!
Hey, put me down! He e e elp!
Oh, no! Ariela is so impatient.
She's turned my machine up too high. Oh!
Help! The only thing worse than me being up here
would be falling down there!
Don't worry! We'll get you down!
We're going to need Big World Magic
to lift Squirmtum down before he falls!
So I need your help. It's time to do the Helping Hand spell.
Are you ready? Tree Fu Go!
Right, copy me. Into your spell pose.
Push your palms forward.
Circle your hands one way. Circle them the other way.
Put one hand behind your head. Other hand behind your head.
Reaching across, catch high.
Reaching to the other side, catch high. Hands on hips.
Catch low in the centre and low in the centre.
Brilliant!
Same moves again. Palms forward.
Circle one way. Circle the other way.
One hand behind. Other hand behind.
Across, catch high. Across, catch high.
Hands on hips. Catch low. Catch low.
Now clap and say "Helping Hand" to send the magic to me.
Helping Hand!
Help!
Ooh. Oh!
Hey!
Yes! We did it!
Squirmtum's safe. Thanks for your help.
Thank you, Tom! I wasn't scared or anything, but the others,
you know, they get a bit nervous.
  OK, I'm glad you're safe.
You have something to say to me, Ariela?
Yeah! Can you fix the Zippyocitor now so I can get harvestin'?
I don't think that's what he had in mind, Ariela.
  You did just break his invention.
  Oh, right. Sorry, Zigzoo.
For not listenin' to you and waitin'.
Sometimes I just get so impatient.
Tell me about it! Can we eat that fruit now? Can we, please? Can we?
Here, then! What are y'all waiting around for?
You can eat some but you gotta help me
get these fruits back to the barn, and fast,
cos I want to get straight back out for more growin' and harvestin'!
I'll stay here to work on the Zippyocitor.
No, Zigzoo. I need all hands on deck to get these fruits harvested fast.
You can fix it later. Time's a wastin'!
OK, I shall fix the Zippyocitor later, after a fruit feast!
  Now's our chance.
  Let's grab it.
Oh, finally, it's ours!
Oh... Let's...
  Fill it with mud and jump on it!
  No! I told you   slime weeds!
You saw how it made those plants grow really fast.
If we use it on some slime weeds,
we could slime the castle before anyone could stop us!
  That's what I was going to say!
  Oh, come on!
Hey! Oh!
Mmm! Oh, that fruit was tasty! Mmm.
Yes, yes! Delicious!
Now let me see if I can fix the Zippyocitor and make it less wild.
Oh!
Er, where is it?
  Eh?
  Huh?
  Uh uh.
  Ariela, did you move it?
  No! I left it right where it was!
That's weird. Don't worry.
I'll do a search and find on the holopax!
Holopax, can you show us where the Zippyocitor is, please?
The castle!
How did it get there?
  Oh, no, one guess.
  Oh! I love games!
  Er...
  The mushas!
Hey! We were right in the middle of a game!
The mushas have got the Zippyocitor? What are they going to do with it?
Oh! Oh, I know, I know! Er... Cause lots and lots of mischief?
He's good.
  We must get my machine back!
  They're heading for Treetog's courtyard!
Twigs, Ariela, you fly with me!
Squirmtum, you go with Zigzoo and the wagon! Let's move!
Weeds and more weeds!
I can't wait to set them all off
and watch slime blast all over the tower!
The tower! The school! Then the streets!
It'll be slime o rific, slime o tastic, slime o brilliant!
Ha ha ha! Whoopee!
Come on, my beauties, grow, grow, grow!
All right, Stink, don't pop a spore!
Slime weeds   everywhere!
Eugh! Horrid.
  Oh, no.
  What has my machine done?
Oh, those naughty mushas.
OK, we need to be really careful or we'll get covered in slime!
Oh, I hate slime weeds!
Argh! I just remembered...
I forgot to...er...remember something back at the ranch!
Now, now, Squirmtum!
We're all in this together!
We need to find the mushas,
stop them sliming the tower and the castle and get rid of these weeds!
We need a plan.
A plan? There's no time for plannin'.
  I'm gonna find them mushas right now!
  Not a good idea.
  Wait for us.
  Come back, Ariela.
Right, Squirmtum and Zigzoo, you wait here
to stop the mushas from getting to the streets with their weeds.
  Yes, Tom! Oh, how exciting!
  Phew!
We don't have to go in there? Oh, that's great!
I mean, right you are, Tom, waiting here it is.
  Twigs, you're with me.
  OK, Captain!
  Let's go!
I keep pressing and turning things but there's no music!
We've only got a few more plants to grow here,
then we can start on the streets!
Give me that! It just needs a girl's delicate touch.
See? It works just fine!
  Now you've done it!
  Quick! Let's get out of here!
Why?
More slime weeds to plant!
In the castle streets!
We've got to stop dancing, then!
  There! Sorted.
Puffy? Er, no!
Hey!
Oh, no!
Oh! Urgh! Oh.
Oh. Oh... Oh... I should have waited for Tom and Twigs.
The mushas! They've turned the music up even more!
We've got to get to them fast!
  Oh.
  Oh. Oh!
Whoa! The weeds are too big and thick!
We're never going to find them! Oh! If only these weeds weren't so huge.
  Of course! Twigs, you're right!
  I am?
  Yes!
We could find the mushas and stop the weeds sliming everything
if we make them all smaller with Big World Magic!
Yes! I am a genius.
I'm going to need your help!
It's time to do the Super Shrinko Spell!
Are you ready? Tree Fu Go!
Right, copy me. Into your spell pose.
Arms out in front of you, hands facing forwards.
Draw a big circle round and then shrink it down.
Draw an even bigger circle round,
and shrink it down to the ground.
Now, with your fingers and thumbs squeeze.
One, two, three, four.
Great. Same moves again.
Arms out. Big circle. Shrink it down.
Bigger circle. Shrink it down to the ground.
Little squeeze. One, two, three, four.
Now clap, say "Super Shrinko" to send the magic to me!
Super Shrinko!
It's working! Look, the slime weeds are getting smaller!
Yes! Thanks for helping. We did it!
  Look!
  There they are!
Hey! Not so fast!
  Very funny! Help us!
  Yeah! Help us!
  That's quite enough of that!
  Oh, that's better! Quick, let's get out of here!
  Yeah!
  Oh, no, you don't!
  Ariela! You're OK!
I caused a lot of trouble today by being impatient
and wantin' everything to be faster than it should.
But you two caused even more!
Hey, but we... What, us? And it... Oh... It was all her idea!
Ooh, it was not so! It was yours! It was his! I tried to tell him but...
You two have a lot of cleaning up to do.
I suggest you take your time and do it right
before Treetog gets back and sees what a mess you've made!
She's not going to be happy!
Treetog?
He's right. Quick, Stink.
OK, Puffy, you'd better start cleaning up.
  No, you better!
  No, you!
I'm sorry, y'all. This was all my fault.
If I'd had patience, the Zippyocitor never would've got into their hands.
That's all right, Ariela. I managed to stop them.
  Yes, with a little help!
  And it all turned out OK in the end.
Yeah! Time to party!
  Let's dance!
  Ha ha!
Woo hoo hoo! Zippy dancing! Look at my feet!
  Oh, yeah, I love it.
  Oh, Twigs!
I'd love to stay and dance
but I've got to fly! Bye, everyone.
  See ya, Tom.
  Take care!
Bye, Tom, see you next time! Whoo hoo hoo!
Thanks for helping me in Treetopolis!
See you soon for another adventure! Bye for now!
