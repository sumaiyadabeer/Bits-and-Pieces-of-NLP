And now the news for the East Midlands, I'm Sarah Teale.
woman who went missing while on board a ferry from Hull to
Rotterdam. Detectives from the Dutch Harbour Police are
investigating Teresa Cowley's disappearance.
Teresa Cowley and her husband boarded the ferry in Hull on
Thursday. It was a regular Christmas tradition for the couple
and both had been in the bar during the crossing. When they got back to
their cabin the dorky did not work and Mr Cowley went to reception
leaving trees outside the cabin. She was seen in the sun lounge on
Dec 11 at about 1am on Saturday and she did not return. Police are
refusing to speculate about whether she has fallen overboard or whether
she was able to leave the ferry in Rotterdam without being noticed.
have nothing to suggest either way at this time. We are in the early
stages of the investigation to try and locate Teresa but we would urge
her to contact either the police, her husband or her family, just to
let us know she a safe and well. Detectives from the harbour police
in Rotterdam are taking the lead on the investigation but it is not
thought anyone else is involved or that as a criminal offence has
taken place. A man's appeared in court charged
with the illegal possession of military ammunition and equipment.
Army bullets and CS gas are said to have been among the items recovered
from Nottinghamshire man Darren Moss. With more details, here's
Simon Hare. Darren Moss leads a Mansfield
magistrates' court. He faces seven charges, all relating to the
illegal possession of purchase of military ammunition and a personal
army radio. The court has heard that the charges relate to 30
rounds of ammunition which is said to have included bullets, shotgun
Darren Moss is 33 and from Tudor Street in Sutton in Ashfield and he
did not enter any pleas to the charges and the case is considered
so serious that the magistrates have decided to send it to the
higher Crown Court in Nottingham. He will next appear there in April.
Detectives are still waiting to question a 71 year old man arrested
on suspicion of murder. 70 year old Julia Thurgaland, who was a church
warden, was found dead at a farmhouse at Maplebeck in
Nottinghamshire on Friday. The man who was also found injured at the
property was taken to hospital. The police have now completed their
enquires at the house and the cordon has been lifted.
East Midlands Ambulance Service are preparing for one of their busiest
nights of the year. Last New Year they had nearly 3,500 calls. Now
staff are pleading with people out celebrating tonight to watch how
much they drink. Carol Hinds reports.
New year's Eve marks the end of more than a fortnight of seasonal
celebrations which puts more demand on ambulances than at any other
time of the year. On the Friday before Christmas we saw more calls
than normal and the trend has continued to Christmas and Boxing
Day and this week. Boxing Day was an extremely busy day with 400
calls more than normal. Tonight we will see up to 1,000 more calls
than normal and it will be very busy. A last new year was the
busiest day of 2011 and they handle the more than three    3,500 calls
between midnight and 4am. Staff say there are simple steps that people
can take to keep themselves safe. Have some Italy before you go out
so you have something in your stomach when you start drinking.
Drink sensibly and have soft drinks and water between alcoholic drinks.
As they brace themselves for another busy night the ambulance
service is urging revellers not to become a statistic I'm letting
alcohol or drugs ruin their night.    by letting alcohol or drugs ruin
their night. Next, an online museum has been
created to mark 100 years since the Leicester Infirmary was granted
permission to use the name Royal in it's title. Our Health
Correspondent Rob Sissons has this report.
An iron lung, a medical relic from this hospital's long and colourful
past. This painting shows the original Leicester Infirmary which
opens nearly 250 years ago back in 1771. There are no photographs from
back then but plenty have been amassed since and they have been
put on the hospital website, a virtual museum. This retired doctor
looks after the collection and he is always on the lookout for new
things. If anyone has got anything which involves the history of the
Leicester Infirmary, whether it be 1950s or even better still going
better to the it in 70s or earlier, we would be interested. The online
museum is to mark 100 years since the hospital was granted permission
to use the name of Royal in its title. History is all around here.
It goes right back beyond even the start of the Infirmary in 1771, it
was a sight for rest for pilgrims and people coming into Leicester.
The collection can be viewed on the Leicester hospital's NHS website.
Work to re open one of Leicestershire's last independent
cinemas is well underway. The Regal in Melton Mowbray closed last year
after it went into administration. Now after months in the dark new
owners have come along and plan to restore the art deco inspired
cinema to its former glory. They hope to be open in March. It will
be there some other people do recognise. The frontage is
fantastic. They know and love it. But we wanted to be a completely
new experience when you walk through the door. That will take
quite a bit to transform it. So how is the weather looking as we
move into the New Year? Anna's here with the forecast is there any
with the forecast is there any respite from the rain?
As we go into 2013 it is a dry and mild a story. First, take your
brolly if you're heading up because there are showers around. We hope
plan. There is a line of showers here moving south and east through
the next few hours. Most of us will have a dry midnight with clearing
colder than we have been used to and they could be a touch of spring
frost in sheltered spots. For most of us it will be dry it with decent
bright and sunny intervals. It will be a breezy day tomorrow and it
will feel chilly in the wind. As we go through the rest of the week it
is going to be a drier story with a little bit of rain around on
Wednesday. Temperatures are starting to rise and there are
double figures for the end of the week. That is your last forecast
for 2012. Hopefully next year we will forecast drier weather for
