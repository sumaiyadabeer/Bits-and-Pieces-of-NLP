First day at work for Italy's new Prime Minister, as the country
battles to ease fears over its debt crisis. Mario Monti is choosing his
new Cabinet, but it doesn't stop the cost of government borrowing
hitting a record high. Here in the UK, there are more
warnings about Britain suffering a "slow and painful" loss of jobs.
After more violence in Syria, king Abdullah tells the BBC President
new phase in political life. "Who guards the guardians?" The inquiry
into phone hacking at the News of the World gets underway.
And, will there be enough security at next year's Olympics? Warnings
In sport, Celtic are to face disciplinary proceedings from Uefa
over chanting during a match The Good afternoon, and welcome to
the BBC News at One. The man chosen to replace Silvio
Berlusconi as Italy's Prime Minister has begun work in earnest
today on forming a new government. Stock markets around the world have
reacted positively to Mario Monti's appointment. His task is to build a
viable administration to implement the austerity measures needed to
tackle the country's massive debt. Our correspondent Alan Johnston
sent this report from Rome. He carries with him the hopes of
Italy, the nation deep in financial trouble is turning to Mario Monti
who has been asked to form a government of experts, and save
Italy from being wrecked, like Greece, in the eurozone chaos. The
grain Mario Monti is a different man from his predecessor, Silvio
Berlusconi. He is a widely expected economist. His university produces
some of Italy's finest thinkers. As an EU commissioner he was known for
tough negotiating styles. And always, he fought for a strong euro.
And mostly, people here seem to like the idea of an expert taking
charge. In my opinion he will be better than what we had
before. Seeing as he is technical it should work. I hope it goes OK
because we just can't take it any more. The international money
markets, which had been crucifying Italy, also like his style, there
is cautious optimism that he will fix this country's finances. In
there, Mario Monti is getting down to business. He is figuring out who
he can work with and exactly what he needs to do to dragger to leap
out of this dangerous financial crisis. The nation's phrase for
radical, painful reform. But will Italy's politicians stand back, and
let this unelected leader lead their country. And remember, this
man is far from finished. To those who
celebrated my exit, I want to say very clearly, I will redouble my
efforts in Parliament to renewed Italy. Silvio Berlusconi retains
the loyalty of the biggest party in Parliament, and, chillingly for
Mario Monti, Mr Berlusconi has said he will pull the plug on the new
government if he does not like what PCs.    he sees. Let's get more
from Matthew Price in Brussels. Is there a sense things are coming
down for the eurozone? There is certainly a sense in
Brussels they have got the man in charge in Italy for they wanted in
charge, Mario Monti was a commissioner in the European Union,
in the European Commission, for a decade. He earned the nickname
Super Mario, seen as an astute political operator who could get
things done. In that sense they have someone they believe is highly
competent, and to understand the workings of Brussels and the
European Union and the eurozone. They also feel they have a similar
person in charge of Greece now. A couple of weeks ago they were
saying Silvio Berlusconi was the problem, that the Greek leadership
is not displaying the characteristics they wanted to see.
Now they have two prime ministers in charge of two critical countries.
If you look at the fundamentals, they haven't changed. In fact they
have got worse. Greek debt is still 350 billion euros and they still
have to pass more austerity measures that the public do not
want. In Italy, they have seen their interest rate, borrowing
costs go up astronomically to record levels and borrowing more
money again today. And there are many other countries, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain, with high levels of debt. But things have got
slightly better, Brussels believes, because of the leadership in Italy
and Greece. A new survey suggests painful" loss of jobs, with the
employment situation set to deteriorate in the final quarter of
this year. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development
questioned more than 1,000 employers and found that, while
fewer firms were planning to make redundancies or relocate abroad,
many were putting off decisions on hiring staff. Our business
correspondent Emma Simpson reports. It is more gloomy news, a
prediction today that unemployment is going to get worse for the rest
of the year. That will make it even tougher for Karen Stromberg to find
a job. This 49 year old mum has been looking for work for two years.
I have applied for a cafe job, I am looking for admin. I just try to
keep optimistic and then someone will give me a break. Once I get my
foot in the door and get to know somebody, it will be fine.
today's survey of 1000 employers showed that hiring in the private
sector will slope over the next few months. As recruitment in the
public sector continues to contract. Companies also say they intend to
cut back on foreign staff. market is struggling at the moment,
the public sector is shedding lots of jobs but in the private sector
employers are Rene wait and see mode, not making more workers
redundant but not in a mood to hire either. Here is one of those
companies wary about taking the plunge, it makes specialist
coatings for the car industry in the west Midlands and has good
contacts in place. It would like to invest but is holding back. We are
hoping to extend and we have planning permission but it is
difficult to justify going ahead because of the economic situation.
We want to go ahead. It is very difficult though to do that until
the world situation settles. course the government has been
relying on the private sector to create new jobs. To make up for the
job losses and spending cuts in the public sector. For much of this
year, it has performed very well. Now though, the private sector is
no longer picking up the slack. We will know the latest official
unemployment figures on Wednesday, as well as the Bank of England
update on the economy. Both will be scrutinised closely, as the
nervousness continues about our recovery.
Let's speak to our correspondent Norman Smith at Westminster.
This is not the news the government wants to here? My sense is this
survey will come as something of a slap in the face for the Prime
Minister, it suggests the private sector is not creating enough jobs
to make up those being shed by the public sector. It suggests
unemployment and youth unemployment is an    is likely to remain high,
when we expect the number of youngsters out of work to breach
the politically symbolic figure of one million, which is why we are
going to see activity by ministers on youth unemployment this week, a
new enterprise allowance, and apprenticeship summit, a campaign
designed to show the government is responding to the crisis of youth
unemployment. But ministers concede they regard this as a long term
structural problem. There is no quick fix. The difficulty
politically with that is that it is likely to be of scant consolation
to the youngsters involved or parents having to watch their
children at home suffering endless rejection letters and unable to get
a job. King Abdullah of Jordan has told
the BBC President Assad should stand down for the good of the
country. European foreign ministers are considering imposing further
sanctions on Syria because of its violent crackdown on anti 
government protests. Today, Syria is as isolated as it
has ever been. The government remains defiant over what is going
on inside Syria. Over the weekend there were a series of pro 
government demonstrations around the country. Today, the Foreign
Minister has had a tough message for the world.
From the Syrian government, some grand Theatre. A series of pro 
government demonstrations, encouraged and choreographed by the
authorities. It is designed to stress their anger and defiance at
being suspended from the Arab League. Many of these Syrians
genuinely support President Assad. Many others have been pushed to
attend. The Syrian government has certainly not lost its sense of
self  righteousness. The Arab League decision is illegal. It has
not been issued by unanimous vote. It does not rely on the legality of
the Charter of the Arab League. foreign minister did apologise for
these attacks at the weekend on the been toughest on Syria, including
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. It seems Syria now regrets the move
which antagonised its opponents and made any compromise with the Arab
League even less likely. Speaking to the BBC this warning, King
Abdullah of Jordan had some blunt words for President Assad. If he
has the interests of his country he would step down but he would also
create an ability to reach out and start a new phase of political life.
Already ministers from the European Union are meeting to discuss
further stanchions. With pressure for action at the United Nations
Security Council. We have taken very strong measures in the
European Union. I think we can add to those. I do not see, the most
specific proposition we can react to, of course we would like to
discuss things further at the Security Council, that is a way we
can help. Sanctions are already biting, although these were queues
for gas in Homs could have been caused by the government tried to
starve out the opposition who are strong there. A band on the cell of
Syrian all to Europe is a vital source of currency for the Syrian
government. Opposition supporters have been celebrating the Arab
League decision but already calling for more. They want a no fly zone
and military intervention. For the moment, those are not on the agenda.
A round now, the Arab League secretary general is beginning a
series of beatings with Syrian opposition to help them to unite in
their opposition    a series of meetings.
The inquiry set up after the phone hacking scuttled began this morning
at the Royal Courts of Justice. The report    the judge will hear
freedom of expression and freedom of the press were fundamental to
democracy. It is an inquiry which is expected
to last many months, one which will hopefully get to the bottom of what
goes on in Britain's newspapers. It was the scandal that began with
the News of the World, Britain's biggest selling newspaper and one
of its brashest. The revelation the paper had hacked into the murdered
schoolgirl Milly Dowler's was last prompted this inquiry. The parents
of Madeleine McCann, and politicians like Tessa Jowell,
along with celebrities like Hugh Grant and Sienna Miller, all
alleged victims of intrusion, are among 50 core participants who will
give evidence. Today, in the measured tones of an appeal court
judge, Lord Leveson issued a warning. The concern has been
expressed that those who speak out might be targeted adversely by the
press as a result. I have absolutely no wish to staff for
freedom of speech, and expression. But I anticipate monitoring will
take place of press coverage over the months to come, and it appears
those concerns are made out, without objective justification, it
might be appropriate to draw the conclusion that these vital rights
are being abused, which itself would provide evidence of culture,
practice and ethics which could be relevant to my ultimate
recommendations. The inquiry's counsel said it would hear evidence
of many kind of intrusion. A range of electronic surveillance, the
interception of Communications, covert listening devices, cine
cameras hidden in wardrobes, cameras hidden behind mirrors, and
the use of telephoto lenses. help him, there is a team of six
expert assessors. Newspapers have complained none come from the
popular press. The inquiry is in two parts, the first looking at the
general question of relations between the press and police, and
politicians. And a second part looking at the legal    illegal
activity of newspapers. The judge cannot start looking at that and
will police inquiries have been completed and that was like putting
the cart before the horse, said one lawyer. We have heard about illegal
activity at the News of the World. Originally, the newspaper suggested
phone hacking was the result of one editor but today we heard there
were 27 different people at the News of the World commissioning
Them on more than 1,500 occasions. The top story: Italy's new Prime
Minister, Mario Monti, is choosing his new Cabinet as he battles to
ease fears over the country's debt crisis.
And the end of an era, Ian Paisley bows from the church he helped to
establish 60 years ago. Later in sport, the Was.s rugby union
flanker has announced his retirement from the game, Joe
Worsley.    Wasps.
100 days since the rioting across England broke out, the Chief
Constable of Greater Manchester police said if the police had
brought the London riots under control earlier, the violence
probably would not have spread to the north west. In an interview
with the BBC's Panorama, Chief Plans are being finalised and they
discovered there is a shortfall of security staff. These other people
who will do perimeter security, searches. In addition to the police
officers and others who are deployed. One private company has
been contracted to provide 10,000 people but they may need another
5,000. The issue is, where do they come from and who pays for them?
Some options include the military, whether they should deploy a more
military involved in this process, as well as looking to the private
Concerns from America as well, what is happening there? There are
reports that the Americans are unhappy about the security plans
going on. I understand that the US embassy will not comment on those,
the British officials are downplaying the sense there has
been a row. What people are stretsing is that the US has taken
a close interest in the security planning. There is no doubt in
their minds that there is a higher threat environment in London for
the 2012 Games from the risk of terrorism, but the plan has been
that they will deploy a large number of people, up to 1hunds
personnel, maybe more to protect their athletes.
   100. Ian Paisley is to step down from
the ministry in the church that he helped to establish 60 years ago.
The 85 year old former MP, now Lord Bannside broke the news in the
Martyrs Memorial Free Presbyterian Church in Belfast. He said he will
now take time to write his memoirs. We have this report.
The church of Rome teaches... 65 years he preached three times a
week including twice on a Sunday. Whether you are religious or I
religious it matters not. You were born naturally as a child of wrath!
Ian Paisley delivered his first sermon back in 1946.
He quickly rose to prominence in the pulpit and in politics.
Never! Never! Never! He founded his own Protestant Fundamentalist Kurch,
confronting the Pope. Few could have imagined that the once
divisive figure would end up as a popular First Minister of Northern
Ireland. Throughout it all he kept preaching.
Father dismisses with my blessing... But but not at the age of 85, he
has decided to retire from his church duties. He is to deliver his
final sermon at his South Belfast church next month. Sundays here
will never be the same again, but his family say he will never
completely retire. I see this as not the closing of a
life story, but the opening up of a new chapter. Ian Paisley has many
things to do, namely to write his autograph. That will be a hum
dinger when it comes out! It seems that Ian Paisley is not ready for
the quiet life just yet. The England captain, John Terry,
has been speaking for the first time since being accused of racism
towards another footballer. Let's go to our correspondent who has
been at the press conference at the team's hotel.
Kch dan, what can you tell us? is the first time that the media
would hear from Chelsea and the England captain since the
allegations of racism erupted. He was accused of raciallism towards
Ann and Rio Ferdinand. John Terry is the subject of two
investigations by the police and the FA. He was left out of
England's surprising 1 0 victory over Spain at Wembley on Saturday
by the coach, Fabio Capello, but against some people's judgment,
Fabio Capello decided to reinstate John Terry for the match at Wembley
tonight against Sweden. As a result of that, he had to address the
media. He was asked whether or not the
match would be the hardest of his career, given the racism row that
has erupted around him. This is what he had to say m No. Not at all,
I don't think so. I'm here, participating in the training,
delighted to be leading the team out as the captain. It has showed
that once again together with the players, we are united no matter
what. That was John Terry there, the
England captain, talking to the media for the first time since
there was a complaint made about a member of the public that he
rairbally abused Anton Ferdinand, who,    he rairbally abused Anton
Ferdinand, who is the brother of the Manchester United deferned, Rio
Ferdinand. There were a whole other questions pertaining to the racism
row, not least the question, are you a racist. On each comment he
was asked to comment. The FA media officer sat alongside him,
interjecting, preventing him from answering, but the message from
John Terry, despite being gagged, is that they wanted to play against
Sweden tomorrow night. That is how he does his business, he wants to
front up and take his place as the captain. He has been sacked as the
captain after allegations that he had an affair as a former team 
meat's wife, now there will be a sterner challenge and choreography
for John Terry to face. Dan, thank you.
Russia has resumed manned space flights with a Soyuz rocket, with
two Russians and an American on board.
The three astronauts are to join the crew of the international space
station. Yes this report from Moscow.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1... The awe inswiering sight of a Soyuz rocket, blasting
off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in winter.
This was a nervous moment. On board were NASA's Dan Burbank
and Roscosmos's, Anton Shkaplerov and Anatoly Ivanishin, the third
men to head into space since the space shuttle was retired last July.
So now the 1960's designed Soyuz is the only route for man's missions
beyond the earth's atmosphere. The launch was delayed as a similar
rocket previously caring cargo crashed. All missions were put on
hold it led to concerns that the International Space Station may
have to be abandoned as there whats no safe way of getting there to
replace the current crew, but the Soyuz has been declared safe after
Roscosmos identified the fauld in what is called the gas generator in
the third stage of the rocket.    fault.
Now, let's catch up with the weather.
weather. Nina is here with us.
It has been a grey, misty and murky start to the day. It is a lot
cloudier and cooler out there. Let's look back 24 hours. The
satellite picture picking up a hope in the cloud. As a result the
temperatures responded. 18 Celsius. Under the cloud it was chilly and
the temperatures struggled to 8 Celsius. Let's move on. What a
difference a day makes. The cloud has rolled in, the 8 Celsius is
more typical across the country. It is not wall to wall cloud, there
are breaks in the south western areas. There are brighter spells
and temperatures here of 14 Celsius. West Wales seeing brighter spells
in the afternoon, as they do in Northern Ireland.
Another favoured spot for brightness this afternoon is
western Scotland. Around the Moray Firth there is foggy conditions,
stubborn to clear this afternoon and the temperatures struggling.
Cloud over northern England, the Midlands and the area corner.
just 11 Celsius. Through this evening, the cloud is back in.
There is hill fog it will be misty with drizzley conditions. It will
be a frost free night. Temperatures lower than last night, sitting at 6
to Celsius. With breaks in Scotland, there could be a touch of frost
here. Tomorrow morning, another overcast
start to the day. There is the cloud with us. Like this afternoon,
there will be breaks developing. Possibly out to the west.
Through the afternoon, a better chance of the breaks developing
over the southern counties of England. Temperature wise similar
to today's, highs of nine to 13 Celsius. Through the week, staying
cloudy. Not a huge amount of rain, but we will start to see the
weather front later in the day on Wednesday trying to get in to the
west. Brightness over the south  eastern areas, but for much of
England it should be dry through the afternoon. Perhaps the
temperature as degree or so up with highs of up to 13 Celsius. The
weather front we have to keep an eye on Thursday it is weakening,
perhaps producing showers to the north and the west. Sunshine in
London. So far this November has been mild. For more details on that,
