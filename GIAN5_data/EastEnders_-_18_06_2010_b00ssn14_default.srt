  She's lying.
  I'm not.
The only reason I went along with it is because he's my dad.
You know what she's like. Tell them!
Archie is the whole reason that I came here.
I thought you came here to steal Roxy's money.
Look, I just want my share. He's my dad, too.
Your father, as you well know,
is a double glazing rep called Nick Winterton.
I met him when I was married to Archie.
  He came to quote for new windows.
  Aunty Peg, she's lying! Tell them.
  Is he the reason that you left us?
  She's just playing games with you!
  Don't listen to him, Roxanne.
  Just be quiet, please.
Both of you. I'm trying to think here.
What I don't understand is if he's not Archie's son, then why...
  why did you give him Archie's name?
  Sorry?
His middle name   Archie.
  His middle name is Nicholas!
  She's lying.
If I am, why don't you show them your driver's licence, so they can see for themselves?
  I don't know where it is.
  Why don't you look in your wallet, Danny?
Oh, Auntie Peg...
I don't know, darling.
This is your pub,
your money,
and it's your decision.
I'm ashamed of you, Daniel. Nearly as ashamed as I am of myself.
All the scheming and the lies.
You two deserved better.
Sorry.
Listen, Rox...
I've listened enough, Danny.
I want you to leave.
  She's the one...
  Get out!
Now.
Glad rags on for you tonight, loverboy,
I am taking you out for dinner.
  Do we have to live like this?
  Didn't you just hear me?
  We are celebrating!
  Celebrating what?
Well, my horse came in
and I won 200 quid!
  What horse?
  Well, perhaps strictly speaking not my horse.
Yeah, so go on, I don't understand.
Poor Charlie Slater. He forgot to pick up his betting slip.
So you picked it up for him?
  My, my, you're quick today.
  So you stole a betting slip from an old man?
  Champagne for us tonight.
  You know what?
I'm taking it over to him.
What?
Oh, come on! He should have been more careful. I've booked us the top restaurant in Soho.
Well, I don't care, cos it would make me gag.
Ryan!
  All right, all right!
  Peggy?
  Oh, Pat, why did our holiday have to end?
  Have you got your keys?
  Why? You want them back?
  I just want to make sure you can get in.
  I thought you said you'd been evicted from your flat?
That's another one of my lies. I'm sorry.
  Will you be all right?
  It's a bit late to start pretending you care now.
I'm never going back there.
  Danny...
  Save your play acting for them.
You're welcome to her.
I know I have no right to say this,
but the two of you...
..you're very impressive young women.
And I'm really proud of you.
I'm going off to pack.
Hey, hey.
Come here, it's all right.
Here, I found this in the hall.
Oh, yeah, I cleared out the junk from the cupboard under the stairs.
  Why?
  Well, we got to make space for the baby.
The baby?
Where else is the buggy going to go?
  Yeah, but this ain't junk! This is my hat.
  I'll get it.
  But you haven't worn it in years.
Yeah, but I like it!
There's a lot of good stuff in this box. And this, look...
this isn't even mine!
  What do you want?
  I've come to talk to Charlie.
  Greece was nice.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, so was Italy. It was nice.
Oh, but no, look, Turkey, that was the best.
Peggy, you should be ashamed of yourself. At your age!
Pot, kettle, black?
Good holiday, though.
  The best.
  Oh, but Pat that cruise!
  Please. Deck aerobics?
  Deck pottery.
  Deck bingo!
  And so many...
  Old people!
I tell you what, Pat, why don't we skip the cruise next time and head straight for Turkey?
I'll drink to that.
Oh, and, er...
we could leave our sun hats at home.
Charlie's been searching high and low for that betting slip.
You left it on a table in the bookies, mate.
Well, I asked Janine and she said no one had seen it.
  Yeah, she found it after you'd gone, cashed it in for you.
  For me?
Yeah, well... Thanks, Ryan.
It's good to know that there's some decent young men left in the world.
You could maybe stay for your tea, our way of saying thank you.
I AM making everyone's favourite  
sausage surprise.
Thank you, but I think I'm still full from that Indian.
And, you know, I got plans and that.
  But thank you.
  No. Thank YOU, son.
I'll see you out.
It's nice to know they're not all knife wielding hoodies, innit.
Stacey...
  earlier on, when I, um...
  Were you feeling sorry for me?
  No.
  Well, good, cos I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.
I don't. What I did, it was...
..stupid and I'm sorry.
You didn't have to bring that money back, you know.
Why didn't you keep it?
It weren't mine.
Thanks.
Nice lad.
I like him.
I ain't sure, Liz.
  You said you were up for it.
  Well, I don't want him getting...
Â£2.15. ..ideas.
Ideas?
  You know, thinking that I'm sweet on him.
  He won't think that.
I'm a respectable married woman.
  Patrick's an old fashioned gentleman.
  No, he ain't, he's a rapscallion.
Do I have to beg?
I owe you.
He ain't said yes yet.
You know, Roxy, she wanted me to sort out
Glenda and Danny for her. But I couldn't be bothered.
I mean, since my cancer scare, Pat, I'm fed up with other people's problems. I just want to have fun!
  You and me both, doll.
  I want to go to parties.
  And bars.
  And I want to see Englebert Humperdinck again.
  Is he still alive?
  I don't know. But I am.
  Too right!
  You know, I once went on one of those girls' night out to the London Palladium to see him.
  Yeah.
  Oh, oh, oh, what he did with his hips!
We all took our knickers and chucked them at the stage!
  As you do.
  Yeah, yeah, well, I want some more of that.
Peggy...
  maybe you and me should get a place together?
  What? You mean leave home?
This place don't feel much like mine any more. Look at the state of this room.
And one of them's even been sleeping in me bed while I've been away.
Think of it...
a flat share.
You're not serious?
Yeah, we could be like that telly programme, The Liver Birds.
That's going back, innit!
I could get a long, dark wig and be the pretty one. You could be the blonde tarty one.
Oh, thank you very much(!) I think I'll stay where I am.
  But we could still go on holidays though, eh?
  Oh, yeah. Lots more holidays.
But no more...
..cruises!
Oh, listen, remember that from the boat?
Yeah, all them old dears getting their bottoms in a twist?
  Are you dancing?
  Oh, are you asking?
  One, two...
  Jim did love his foxtrot.
  Really?
And of course the waltz.
In fact, for a man so fond of his ale,
he was surprisingly nimble on his feet.
But of course with his current indisposition, he ain't able to dance no more.
But he has given me his blessing.
And of course he trusts me implicitly as I do him. But...
  Would you care to partner me?
  Partner you?
  To the over sixties dance?
  No, no, no, that ain't my kind of scene. Sorry.
  Oh, just a thought.
Forget about it. It's silly.
  On the other hand...
  Yes?
I mean, a lot of fun, going with you.
And you're a fine figure of a woman.
Oh, I say.
Yeah, man!
I'm off then.
  I'm really sorry.
Mum?
You remember that time I came to see you in your flat?
You said that you didn't want the baby to grow up with Archie. Why did you say that?
  It was true.
  Then why didn't you tell us about Danny's dad?
  Pride?
  What happened to him?
Well, he said he was going to leave his wife.
Next month, once he got things sorted. Always next month.
And then he got a job in Scotland.
And took her with him.
Never heard from him again.
Are you going to be OK?
Me? I'm tough as old boots.
Don't worry about me.
If I could change one thing in my life,
just one...
it would be the day I walked out on my girls.
It was a terrible thing to do.
And I will never forgive myself.
It's like losing her all over again.
Mum, wait!
  Would you like to stay on for a bit?
  Really?
Yeah!
I'd like that very much!
Peggy come on, just another little drink.
No, I've got to get the kids presents to 'em.
They can wait another five minutes, can't they?
Well...
No! No!
Pat Evans, you're a wicked woman!
I've got to go.
Two for me then!
  I don't know why you're bothering with this?
  Don't know what you mean.
Well, I got the impression last week...
that you were getting plenty of exercise in the sack.
Yeah, man, my new exercise bike! Denise, you managed to get it then.
Yeah, yeah, it was the last one in stock, actually.
You see, never too late to get in trim. Shirls, thanks, man.
I can take over from here, OK?
Do you want one?
Thanks.
I, um...
I've got to go into Covent Garden tomorrow, to look for some new shoes,
  I wondered if you wanted to go with me?
  Yeah, that'd be nice.
Phil's not in, Ben's not answering his phone
and I couldn't face going round to Ian's. So what's a girl to do?
  Have another drink?
  Thought you'd never ask.
Chinese?
  Yep.
  Get any for me?
Only had enough money for one.
Man, this place is so disgusting.
So did Charlie Slater slobber his gratitude all over you?
  If you're asking if he was pleased to get his winnings back...
  Smart move, Ryan.
You know, soften her up.
Make her think that you're the nice guy,
get her defences down and then...pounce!
Not a bad plan.
I just want to keep fit,
you know...
..keep in shape.
You know, it's easy to let yourself go...
..'specially once you're past 40.
It's a very difficult age for a woman.
I just want...
I just wa...
I just want to make him love me.
'Fair's fair. Right, you actually saw me get my kiss off of Lucas,
'I reckon part of the deal has to be that I get to see'
  you make your move on Stacey. What is this?
  It's your money.
  What?
  You win.
I tried. I failed. Congratulations, the money's yours.
Now can we please talk about something else, I'm bored of the bet
and I'm bored of living like this?
Thanks. So am I letting myself go?
  No. No.
  Oh, come on, be honest.
Once a girl gets past a certain age...
she's got to make a bit more effort.
Denise! You are a beautiful woman!
Maybe I used to scrub up all right.
No, no, no, stop right there.
I don't want to hear that kind of talk again, you hear me?
You're a stunner.
Why are these things never easy?
I don't know.
  You want any ice in that?
  Do you ever get lonely, Patrick?
What, living in this house?
After Kevin died...
I had the girls, you know, they were fantastic, I had friends, I had you.
But I used to get so lonely.
Sometimes...
Sometimes, with Lucas, it feels like...
I'm living with a stranger.
And after Trina was gone, and Owen was gone, I thought things would get better.
But neither of them are around any more.
So what more have I got to do to make this marriage work, Patrick?
No, you know what, I'm just being stupid.
Yeah.
Stupid.
  I'm home!
  Auntie Peg, good timing. Charlie's on the phone for you.
Charlie? Oh!
Oh, hello, Chaz! What can I do for you?
It's more like what I can do for you.
You see, I've got something here that belongs to you.
Well, can I bring it over later?
Well, in the bar about eight o'clock?
Lovely. See you then. Ta da!
  Oh, you're still here?
  As you see.
And Danny?
But the girls have asked me to stay for a bit.
Oh, I see.
  Ronnie's even asked me to go shopping with her this weekend.
  Well, that'll be very nice for you.
Excuse me.
Yeah, man, a princess any man would be proud to have on his arm!
And is that a new fragrance you're wearing?
Just soap and water.
Then you naturally smell of roses!
Oh, you and your flannel. Hold on a minute.
A jewel among women!
A shining diamond.
Brother Jim!
Thank you for loaning me your wife.
He ain't loaning me   he's coming with.
Here, Peggy, this one looks all right.
Yeah, yeah, it's lovely. Shirley, come here a minute, darling.
I went round the house earlier, but there was nobody in.
No, Phil took the kids for a burger after school.
Only I got some bits and pieces for Ben and Louise.
  That's nice.
  I couldn't face taking Ben's pressies round to Ian's.
Well, actually, Peggy... Ben's moved back in with us.
  Oh. That's fantastic. So everything's worked out?
  Well...
He's went before the magistrates and it's all done and dusted?
Yeah, he's been up before the magistrates.
He most likely had his knuckles rapped.
That's a lesson he won't forget in a hurry and I'm glad it's over.
  Evening, ladies.
  Oh, hello, Chaz.
  Best get on.
  So, what do you think?
What's that, then?
  Our next holiday!
  You know...
..Ronnie's never asked me to go shopping with her.
Roxy has, but never Ronnie.
  She always said she preferred to go shopping on her own.
  Does it matter?
No, not a bit.
So what about it? Shall we book it?
Tell you what, if it wasn't for Stacey and her baby I'd be coming along with you.
  You two ready for a top up, yeah?
  Yeah, yeah, yes, please.
Cheers, Charlie. Peggy, it's 100 quid, including flights.
They're practically giving it away. Let's book it, eh?
Yeah, book it, I can't wait to get away from this place quick enough.
  I can't believe you haven't told her about Ben going up to Crown Court.
  I didn't want to spoil her holiday.
You better get yourself down here sharpish, let her know what's going on.
Cos if you don't... somebody else will.
Lucas, how long does it take to get a few biscuits?
I'm an intellectual, OK, I'm not a DJ to a bunch of old biddies.
I got to go. Dot, hi, I didn't know you were coming.
Oh, I brought Jim, cos he likes a bit of music, don't you, Jim?
Hey, what is Liz doing here?
Your lady wife wouldn't have set me up, would she?
I bought you a drink.
  Why?
  I'd like us to be friends.
  Why?
Oh, Peggy, please.
I hear you're going on holiday again next week.
I was talking to your friend in the Ladies.
You should go. You deserve it, you've earned it.
Peggy, I admire you.
The way you've kept your family going, year after year.
You're a beacon to the rest of us.
I wish I could be strong like you. But I'm weak.
A silly weak woman. But I'm working on it.
And look, I know I can never shine as bright as you.
But, while you're away, I'll do my best to carry your torch.
Oh, you've already got a drink?
Oh, I'll have yours, Charlie.
That one will be laced with arsenic.
Oh, cheers, Charlie.
Right, to Turkey. Here come the Golden Girls.
I thought you said we were going to be The Liver Birds?
  If you could hold off for a couple of weeks, maybe I...
  Peggy?
What do you reckon Charlie's got in there? Do you think it's a big stick of rock?
She said she's going to carry my torch.
Give her the present, Charlie.
Well, it's not exactly a present...
Jean was having a clear out and she was going to throw it away.
I know you said at Christmas for me to bin it back, but I couldn't.
I never thought I'd see this again.
Maybe I should have binned it, like you asked?
I'm sorry.
That is a bit of Walford history, that is.
This pub won't see your like again.
Mum?
I need to talk to you.
I hate this music.
Oh, no offence, Jim...
but as soon as a girl gets her freedom pass,
they expect you to wear flannel knickers, sensible shoes
and get into this big band sound. I wasn't born till the war was over!
We used to dance this to the wireless.
In Wales.
We'd put the blackouts up, pile of logs on the fire,
make a plate of hot toast and dripping.
Oh, they were happy days!
Mini skirts, flower power, that was me.
Beatles. Stones...
..Elvis.
I expect this is a bit old fashioned for you.
Hey...
I ain't much younger than you, you know.
Patrick Trueman, you're a flirt and a flatterer...
and a gentleman.
You don't want to waste time dancing with me, you should be dancing with some younger woman.
I ain't no gentleman, you know.
Oh, thank you!
It's no fun for you stuck here with all these wrinklies, is it? Lucas is on the way.
  It's fine, I've just got work to do.
  I thought you'd finished your exams?
  Yeah, books to read...
  Really nice here, isn't it? Calm. Dignified.
  No, do not be fooled.
This hall is a hotbed of intrigue and betrayal.
  Yeah, yeah.
  All right then, see that lady over there, Mrs Bellamy?
  What, in the blue dress?
  Yep. Mr Bellamy thinks she's at bingo.
  Ooh. And who is she dancing with, then?
  Mr Murray.
And where's Mrs Murray think he is?
  Mrs Murray's in the graveyard.
  I'm sorry.
But Mr Murray's fiancee is right there.
  She don't look too happy, does she?
  She's a lot happier than him.
  What's supposed to be wrong with Patrick now?
  What do you think?
Liz.
See ya.
Crown court? There must be some mistake.
No.
Could he get sent down?
  We're trying not to think about it, Mum.
  But he could?
  We're just not going there. I better get back to the house. I left the kids with Zsa Zsa.
  Phil!
  Yes, yeah. It's a possibility.
  Let me come.
Not now. Louise was on her way to bed when I left the house.
  But I can bring the kids' pressies.
  Tomorrow would be better.
All right. Tomorrow.
Try not to worry about it, OK?
You tell 'em I'll be round first thing in the morning.
What was all that?
Oh, go on, Patrick, ask her to dance.
Why would I do that?
Cos she's the youngest woman in the room.
Apart from them Foxes, of course.
OK, ladies and gentlemen, by special request...
Mr Elvis Presley!
Fancy a dance?
No, thank you.
Thanks, anyway.
  I say, she's a lovely little mover.
  Oh, gosh, don't you ever give up?
For goodness sake man, I ain't asking you to marry the woman,
I'm just saying let yourself have a bit of fun and dance with her!
The day this went up, I felt so proud.
I thought...
"..I'm Queen of the Vic."
Look forward, Peggy, not back.
Think about Turkey.
I felt so alive that day.
So important.
I thought, "Here I am...
Except Archie had other ideas.
But I'm still that same person, out on the street.
This place is mine,
I don't need anyone to carry my torch.
I can do that myself.
Darling, can't you just let it go?
No...
I'm needed here.
Ben needs me,
my family needs me
and my pub needs me.
I'm going to show Archie, and I'm going to show her and I'm going to show everyone else around here
that nobody messes with Peggy Mitchell!
This sign is going back where it belongs...
above the door.
The Vic is mine...
and I'm not going to rest till I get it back.
