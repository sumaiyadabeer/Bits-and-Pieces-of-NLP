a frosty start on Sunday morning in In Glasgow at the World Open, it
has been a day for emerging players. A first match features the reigning
world champion, Neil Robertson, against 21 year old David Morris
who seemed destined for success having grown up in Kilkenny in a
house No. 147. He was making his TV debut today. Having lost the
opening frame, we pick them up in frame two in the company of Willie
Robertson is very pleased to have been given a second chance and the
opening frame. He probably thought he was going to lose it. He missed
a relatively easy blue, young David, but he knows his way around the
table. Crafty Ken has been coaching him. That is not a bad coach to

has got away with it. What can he do now? Red to the left middle. Can
he punished the world champion for He missed that red. He was more
concerned about controlling the cue ball for position on the black. It
is an error we all make. Putting your positional play before the pot.
I always remember my late father same, make sure you pot the ball.
At least you have an alternative. They used to think you could just
pot anything. Yeah, as don't worry about position. Make a ten break.
You're not going to win many matches making a ten break. That is
where the game has changed. It is a lot more attacking. Years ago, if
he potted a red and the cue ball finished their or the brown in the
middle and he played the brown and missed it, your house will be
saying, why didn't you roll up behind the brown?    your pals
This is turning out to be quite a scrappy frame. The first one was
very good. So far in this one, he covered the red he played. The red
in the cluster will go to the left corner. I think he is taking it on.
Not very close. Not enough pace in the cue ball. You would think he
would make an effort to try to I was quite pleased with the way
David had settled in the first frame. But I think the first frame
has affected him a bit. That is the worst thing that can happen. You
get chances and you think you're going to win the frame and then it
is snatched from you. It can affect your confidence. It is about 98% of
people who win the first frame go one to win the match. Nobody as yet
has lost the first two frames and come from behind to win 3 2. But it
will happen. You are strong favourite when you are 2 0 in front.
He just underhit that, the wrong side of the blue. Those two reds on
the right hand side of the table, the right hand side might not grow
but the left hand might go.    go. Being best of five, it is a bit
risky. You would fancy someone like Neil to pot it. He is going to play
He has played for the left hand side of the two reds. There is a
possibility he could get position. The pink may be available as well
He thought it was in by the look of it. But it never looked in to me.
David, time to re establish I hope he has not gone too far to
the black. No, comfortably on it. The red just above the black could
It is a funny game, isn't it? It's certainly looks as though losing
that first frame has had an adverse effect on him. It shows you how
nerves come into the game. David has made a high break. He has won
many championships as a junior, but the step up from playing lower
seeded players or play is not really on television, this is a
massive.    or players. I'm sure people in his club are thinking, he
never misses those in the club. But Can you remember your first
televised game, John? I remember it was in black and white! The brown
was behind the yellow? Yeah. Funnily enough, it was an amateur
Roger Lee got ATV to of it.    got a DVD. He is a great player. It
shows you how sad he is to have a tape of John Virgo playing snooker
as an amateur! He used to have the heritage room at the Crucible
Theatre. He used to find it very interesting looking at the
memorabilia of great players of the past. He needs to kiss the black.
That is unlucky. If he kisses the black, he is on this red. He has
been given a bit of a lifeline. Unfortunately, it does not appear
as though he is going to make the Just when he needed a bit of help

shot and should build his confidence. Yes. We had that the

left David an easy safety shot. Thinner on the ones on the right 
hand side.    thin. I think he has got to play it. If you can, you
have to put your ball in as much trouble as you can. Playing of
those two reds to the right of the pink, it looks like a decent target.
Last time he played it, he caught It is not bad. He would prefer that
cue ball tight against the baulk I wonder who is going to win this
safety battle. You would have to say that Neil Robertson would be
favourite but whoever pots the next red now, the balls are in a perfect
position for a possible clearance, so this next red is very important.
I think he is eyeing up the pot on this red into the right corner. If
it is just off straight, he could play a run through. If it goes
beyond the black, it could be a Where is the black going? The red
has gone on to the left middle. The black is over to the corner. A
little unlucky. He played in such a way that the only red he could

in the middle, White is it difficult when the white is a foot
further away?    why is it difficult. You have to be more
accurate when you are striking the cue ball. You see so many players
hitting slightly across the ball. But when you see these top players
at the top of the game, when you watch Ronnie O'Sullivan or Neil
Robertson, that cue goes through straight. That is the key to this
Looking at that, he can screw back off the cushion. If the two reds

he does not get the kiss on the red, he will be on the other two. He has
played the kiss on the red. Just a fraction too hard. Good effort. He
needs a good pot now. But he probably will not take it on.

you. I don't expect him... I thought he might just try to keep
things tight as David Morris is struggling. You are always
If this red is near the middle, he would rush to take your advice.
Doesn't everybody take my advice? Not if you have been bitten more

David, David, what was that? Tension, John. Is he gripping the
cue too hard? I don't understand why he's hitting it so bad. It was
a poor shot. He has missed a golden opportunity. He really has. And
another opportunity there has been missed to put Neil Robertson in
trouble. He has not got the snooker and has knocked the red into play.
He could not have done much more When you make mistakes, they seem
to get a bit compounded. You Robertson was fortunate to kiss the
brown. He might be able to get through to the potting angle of
this red. If he can, he has got to take it on. He can't get through to
the potting angle. He has been very fortunate. This could go in off.
Excellent shot. That is the best Can he get through by the pink? He
is unlucky. You would not think it is possible. Now he has hit the
pink. The replacement of this will The referee decided to give a free
ball. I am surprised Neil Robertson did not question it because with
the angle he had on the red, he could have hit both sides. But he
probably thought it was a free ball. David Morris is leading by 17
points. This red is available but he has not got on it nicely. 23 in
front. He just needs any colour. The draw screw back a couple of
inches and get on the pink in the middle. Don't be risking trying to
get it could cannon on the black. If he risks green off the black, he
It is risky to play for the black, but it has worked. If that black
had gone high, he would have been on nothing. He has not check the
scoreboard. I assume he realises that the black is almost frame ball.
We have a 31 point lead. 27 left on David Morris will have got his
first frame on people in televised That looks like a snooker to me. I
don't know where he can get between brown and pink, we are almost
straight down the line. He has got I bet his heart was in his mouth
when the black was on its way The reason he is reluctant to take
the yellow one is because black and blue are out of commission at the
moment. The more balls on the table, the better. That is why he did not
play the pot. He only needs one He played the right shot. He tried
to push the brown on to the cushion. That would have been very difficult
for Neil Robertson. He could play the yellow up and down, trying to
get the white in. The pink is there That is a terrific shot. That is a
That was not bad either. At this high level, it is all right saying
there you need a snooker, but you have to get one and think get your
opponent to miss. That was a good hit from David. Remember, four.

out of his chair to carry on.    so that. David Morris should have won
the first frame. He has won the second. At least he can settle now.
Neil Robertson acknowledges defeat. A scrappy frame but he won it. He
Best of five. It is now best of He could not have missed the red by
further. If you hit them hard enough, there are six pockets on
the table, it could go in one of them. Nowhere near the pocket. Off

the fact that Neil is on nothing. He is not entitled to be on

they would just have to sit and suffer. At the moment, it is not

match. He still has every chance.   He had to go for that one. It could
be costly. The only way he him get onto the blue is screwing around
That is why he has played around two cushions, to give himself
That could have worked out better. He can still pot this red along the
top cushion, but it is tricky. There is an alternative to the
right middle which could tempt him. I get the feeling at the moment,
Neil Robertson is just taking this a little bit too easy. Yes, I agree
with you, John. He went for a red in the previous game and ended up
playing over the pocket. These matches are very short. If you give
your opponents that bit of confidence, they are going to
improve. But this is another great This is developing into a first 
class opportunity to take the lead in this match. When you consider
what happened in the first frame, David could have won 3 0. That is a
A little kiss on the black when potting the next red. He can still
pot it but it is a bit trickier. He has missed it. That was a good
opportunity. How has his luck been? He may have got away with that. He
should have won the first frame. He had good clearance for Neil
Robertson to win it. All of a sudden, it is like a meal tip his
foot off the gas a bit.    Neil took his foot. Neil Robertson won
the second frame. He was in a relatively good position. He could
have won 3 0. But he has just got to hold himself together at the
minute because Neil Robertson is not playing well. He just took his
eye off the pot in the second frame to miss a few. He missed a black
off the spot. Maybe Neil thought, I don't have to do much to win this
match. But you don't take liberties He has a match on his hands, has
the world champion. He can't switch it on and off like a lightbulb. He

There it is an extension on the cue to hope he can reach it. He could
get on the black if he runs through but it looks like he's getting
quite low on this. Pink in the middle. This is not a bad chance.
The three reds are around the pink spot and the other loose reds are
in play. It will not be too long If he has the right angle, he will
get onto the black. Otherwise he He is not have a great angle to run
through for the black. He cannot That was a clever shot. The bottom

point.    I don't. The two reds that are below the pink, he's going
to have to bring them into play if he is going to win the frame. These
two reds are in the open. The one in the bulk end is in the open. But

But it is nerve racking watching anybody. It would be a lot worse if
it were your own son. They are hoping he can turn the world
champion over. This is an aggressive shot, a couple more reds
in play after this one. But the safety shot was not perfect. He is
in a little bit of trouble here. I wonder if he can get through the
yellow and blue to catch the second red down from the pink. A bit
further left than that. Can he get through to those? If he can, he has
a natural angle to get back into a ball. That is the gap he would like
to play. If you have to start playing with a lot of side, that is
He spotted a planned. But didn't seem to be enough. Well, I don't
think he spotted a plant, I think he played it with a bit of side but
That will be OK if the pink goes in the middle. I don't think it will.
If it does, that is a result. He took a chance, it would pass the
red, but it can't get to the bottom ankle of the pink. He is entitled
to take the chance, crossing the red. But these reds are spread far
and wide now. Said David Morris is under a lot of pressure with the
safety. Any progress in the He is looking at the potting angle
of the red. There is a way back into pot on this one. It is not
easy. If the pink pottery in the right hand middle, he could take
the red on, but a good safety shot is needed to try to get the white
somewhere close to where it is now would be nice. That is not good. He
have to play those with a lot of side to find the top cushions. He
may have gotten away with it with the qualifiers, but here, you will
eventually get punished. Swing at around three cushions, the white
will end up somewhere near the top The red is no problem at all, but
it cannot get on to the colour. That is probably why he is looking
at a safety. He cannot get out into He is in a bit of bother there, he
tried to parties way out of trouble. But I don't think he's come out too
bad, you know. I think he has come out smelling of roses. There is a
possibility of two reds, but hampered by this red near the top
cushion nothing might tempt me all. A lot to play in the short frame
He doesn't appear to have a lot on, but I wouldn't think you can get
through to the green and brown. It was a pleasant surprise when he
looked and saw the gap. But it took him a lot of seconds to notice it.
You just have to keep your head still Mondays, just make the pot,
don't worry about the white. Well It was a good pot, and you saw what
a good result it had. He just seems to be one of these players, and
there is a lot of nerves and tension out there, but it is like
he has taken his time. But then he seems to play pretty quick. It is a

the line and play it on the middle. This is a little bit risky, but he

It is all about holding herself together. In practice, he has had
absolute certainty. It just shows you how different it is out there
This tournament, just a one table situation, no interference or
applause from the other tables which you get at most of the
tournaments, when you can concentrate 100%. The fact that it
is one table with television cameras there. Like Daleks, they
are. Looking at you. That is where the pressure comes from. And a
major ranking event, the world open. There is an example, he thought
about that and played it a little bit quick. The red is easy enough
to pot, can he holed position on the pink? He has done pretty well,
that is the point Steve Davis was making. On this superfine cloth,
you have to have good control. But there is a little bit of pressure
on this pain.    pink. He is somehow going to have to pot
another four reds at least. That will be very tough to do. Here's

the one close to the black is the one to play. In an ideal world, you
would like it a bit straighter, but it is well within his compass. He
overcut it. He didn't really fancy it, but it was the right shot to
play. There is mum and dad, just discussing it. Arms folded. He has
a 29 point lead, it won't be easy for Neil Robinson to even close the
gap. Never mind win the frame. And he won't be doing it missing shots
like that. It looks like it is Neil Robinson's form to be fortunate.
you see the red above that, he can't possibly miss the plant.
Particularly the one which is closest to the side cushion. Play
one onto the other. That read in the middle of the three, just play
it down the line. I don't know why That is the red you're talking
about, and it looks as though he is going after the other one. He has
to play it. There is plenty of room, isn't there? They are very close to
the cushion, it doesn't pass the red. That looks as though it does
from we are. Maybe it is not as straightforward as we thought. I
would be playing at though, there is no way he can leave those two
reds there. I couldn't have done it that way for all the tea in China.
He played the cannon, but is asking a lot. He nearly got it. Once again,
it is the run of the ball. He has the red, the pink has come to his
rescue, then to reds in the corner. That is the pink for the left
middle. He would like to pocket and not the red which is just to the
right of the middle pocket, he wants that to stay there. It will
still be a big ask to win the frame This opens the black up. He is not
necessarily the favourite to win the frame. He is going to need both
of those reds to make the frame. There is really only one to build
one, because the one on the back cushion you can get on the black.
This has been a little bit of work from him today. Plenty of chances
What would you do here? Try to leave an ankle on the red to try to
pocket and disturb the other red? would only be worried if the red
stayed near the cushion, it would make the pink difficult. But I
would like to leave it at that angle. They too need to catch it at
the half all. It is not an option now. He cannot put the red while he
still has the other one. It reduces the area's two four points. But
then the work starts. Maybe he can force it   no he couldn't do it. He
needs a little angle to get the help for the black from this is not
straightforward just the at    just yet. He has a bounce. Now, the work
starts. A fly flying around there, just landed on his sleeve. Some big
ones in, bluebottles I think. have had a bit of rain, it has been
very mild in Glasgow. Bluebottles,? He is going to play the cannon, but
it is almost impossible to catch it at the right place. Has he got it?
A good effort, but almost impossible to get the perfect
contact and the perfect pace. That is the end of a break. Just a
safety shot to come. I could have thought of a better one than that.
That to me hands the initiative to his opponent. That target of yellow,
Much too thin, missed a trick there. I know it is his first go on
television but that was a massive target. Neale can play the pot,
knowing the cue ball will go back down between the three balls be
talked about. This might be gained ball from    game ball. One of the
players is knowing the ankles, the other isn't. He has to hit this,
there is room around it. They missed call but it won't be taken.
His parents are looking on anxiously. Neil Robertson, 15
points to lead. A match winning opportunity. David will be
disappointed, he has not been outplayed by any stretch, he knows
he has had chances every frame. And good chances. The pressure has just
got into him a little bit today. He needed to get the brown to be
certain of taking the frame. That And excellent positional shot. It
was making it a little bit awkward, but I can't see a problem there.
it is over. And David has had a few chances. He will learn from the
experience, that's for sure. There is no need for him to be frightened
to play a top player again. He can play at this level. Just a couple
of inexperience to shots, but all in all, that is the end of the game.

managed to battle through for the first time to the last stages of a

style. Sighting with the one I. Pretty close with that but it
didn't go in and he has left Ricky a chance. Highlight the way he
plays the game. I like his manner a round the table, he is busy, always
seems to have something in mind. When he is on his game, he is a
match for most players. Took the chance to try to open summer. I
don't think he intended to cannon at red, he was intending to miss
that. He is not going to score that many from that chance. If you go to
his club Winchester, he has a lovely club, 6 biddable tables. He
has a start table that he is allowed to practise on. It can see

shots. He never missed. I think a lot of people forget that. On the
practice table, that's what they do, That type of shot is difficult,
your first time on television, you can practise with some of the best
players in the world, but the lighting is different, it is all
new. It will take him a while to Funnily enough, his stance is a bit
like Mark King. There are many two players in the game that play that
way. He is quite a tall lad, Ricky, but he is comfortable. Dear member
John? The book said, that is the only way to play. There have been a
few different styles of play since. So far, Ricky Walden has not made
the most of his opportunities, and that was an average safety shot to
say the least. Just issued a cross that.
A lot of over viewers would remember Graeme Miles. He was over
in holiday, and he drove 50 miles to go and see one of the sisters. I
hope he is keeping much better. He was one of our great characters
from an in amongst the balls he was a very good player. He made his
name on Pot black. A little bit of One think about Ricky, he likes a
bit of talk on the tip. He is always talking.    chalking.
That was always a danger. It is a funny thing, we go on about these
best of fives, but James McBain has had a few shots which he has missed.
Ricky Walden doesn't have that settled it to me at the moment.
think James needs an easy pot to get going. To beat Mark Allen, he
must be a very competent player indeed. Because young Mark Allen, a
lot of people fancy him to go on to Always a dangerous thing when
playing safe to catch a ball of colour. It is a straight red, just
good killing required. He is not taking it, one in the middle, but
there is an element of safety. Obviously he has not feeling that
confident. I know it is the best of five but he would have thought he
would have taken the straight red. If he would have knocked that in he
would have been on the black. So Ricky is a bit tentative at the
He is just all over the place at the moment. He needs an easy chance
to settle himself down. So difficult when you appear on
television for the first time. Family first time I appeared on
television for the first time, he was on 1974, couldn't get a smile.

think where the red is situated, he Are just forget about the black and

right corner. You'll have to be on red in such a way to roll it in and

This frame is well and truly over now. Not really giving James a

To make this century. And a century it is! James McBain still unable to
pot the ball. He is only one frame away from defeat. At soldier the
black would be a problem, didn't die? So at the moment, he is just
plain sailing for Ricky Walden. But Ricky McBain    James McBain, what
In the end, he has just contented himself with getting a red saved.
Don't blame him for that. Ricky playing the double. That is a
strange type of shot. News then the red near the balls, your opponent
will try to split the EU behind. He once the red to stay away from
the cushion. And makes it slightly easier. It is not really a
snookering, he can end it with a touch of side. In fact, he can hit
it direct. At first glance, it looked like a snooker, but it is
going to be tough to hit because the pink is in the way. You would
think it was a straightforward escape but because of the pink, it
is not. It is not far enough back He is trying to make the angle to
miss the pink. I don't know if he can do it or not quite. That is a
cracking shot! Can you get your breath. He waited 40 minutes to get
a chance, he plays a brilliant escape and flicks the red in the
middle. What can he do now? He needs to pot the colour. At the
moment, he is up to four snookers. He has tried to pot the pink, what
a sharp! He has kept his hopes alive! Not often you see that type
of double play but he judged it to perfection. He has got the snooker.
Hold the Back Page. This could be one of the great comebacks of the
modern game. I thought he would cut it down. That looks an easy hit.
But you never know. He is the one snookered now, to tie. 27 remaining.
What a turnaround this would be. Just a fraction too hard. And if
James could get a chance, he could pop the yellow green brown, and the

He will be lucky if he gets a Chinese snooker. For me, you have
to keep the object ball safe and he didn't do that. He was rather
fortunate there with Ricky. I'll, another miscue, and can't get a
breath. I have seen it all now. Unlucky. Very fortunate to leave
doubles and a paint you will see anywhere. He needs another snooker.
I think Ricky is a little bit shook He has to be careful, you would
think roll the green and be over, but you can't afford to do that. To
play it with a bit more pace, and as you mentioned earlier, if they
can pop the green and the brown and get the snooker on the blue behind
the black, one snooker would be sufficient to be able to win. Maybe
it is premature to think that the frame was over. I thought it was

This looks like it is the end. I don't think he will need the rest.
Ricky Walden is about six feet 3. What a battle he has put up. Left
himself in a position where he could win the frame but was unlucky
and had a miscue. You'll have to say a relieved Ricky Walden, he
thought he would have been back at the hotel, having a nice shower. He
has had to work a little bit harder. He just could not get going early
on in the match, but well done Ricky Walden. With a century break,
