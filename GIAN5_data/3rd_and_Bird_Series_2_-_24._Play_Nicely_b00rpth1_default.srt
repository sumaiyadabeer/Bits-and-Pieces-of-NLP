..It's a picnic for the whole community...
Hello!
..We sit outside and munch on a lovely picnic lunch
All prepared by Mrs Billingsley...
Oh, well!
But the games are the best part of the picnic
Sometimes, you lose and other times, you win...
Is every birdie ready?
  Ready!
  Is every birdie set?
  Set!
Then by the power vested in me as the Keeper of the Tree
  I hereby decree...
  Oh, please, Lovebird!
Let the games begin!
  There's horseshoes!
  And bowling!
  And yes, even limbo!
  Elliot's the best at that.
Wow, look at him go!
No fair, he's got no spine!
..Yes, there's games and fun for everyone
At the 3rd & Bird community picnic!
Muffin love games, Muffin want to play games!
Wonderful! Oh, but the most important thing of all
is to play nicely.
Play nicely?
Yes, whether you win or lose,
always be nice to the bird you're playing with.
  Play nicely, got it.
Right this way, children!
Now, for the first game, how about a hopping race?
  Hopping race?
  Yes.
Both you birds will start to hop
When the race begins The first to cross the finish line
Will be the bird who wins.
OK, Daddy. Ready, Jordan?
Ready, 'Uffin.
Go!
Come on, Muffy, you can do it!
Good job, Jordan, just hop to it!
There you go, you're almost done
Muffin won!
  Good job, 'Uffin.
  Thank you, Jordan.
  They certainly are playing nicely, Beakman.
  They certainly are.
Ah, it reminds me of when I used to beat YOU at the hopping race.
  Excuse me!
  Come along, children, it's time for...
the trampoline bouncing contest!
  Trampoline?
  Yes!
You both bounce on your trampoline as high as high can be
Whoever grabs the berry first
Will claim the victory!
  Good luck, 'Uffin.
Good luck, Jordan.
And you are doing very well at playing nicely, may I add!
Ready, kids?
Go!
That's it, Jordan
  Bounce, bounce, bounce!
  Higher, Muffin, each one counts!
Jordan, that's extraordinary!
Jordan got the berry!
  Jordan good bouncer.
  'Uffin sweet.
I remember how I used to beat YOU at the trampoline contest.
What? I've never lost a game to YOU!
Daddy and Beaky play game together?
Yes, I used to beat Mr Beakman
at all kinds of games when we were younger.
  Oh.
  YOU beat ME?
Oh, that's a laugh! Ha ha ha ha!
A laugh, eh?
I challenge you to a nest building contest!
Whoever can build a nest first wins
You're challenging me to a nest building contest?
I built the nest that YOU hatched in
I accept your challenge!
All right, you two, you know the rules.
You each choose a pile of sticks The thick ones, or the thin
Whoever builds a nest the fastest is the winner.
Understood.
Ready...
Go!
And the winner is...
Mr Lovebird!
What? Impossible!
  Quinn, what do you think?
  I just said he won.
  YOU lost.
  Did not!
  Did too!
Did not!
  Daddy and Uncle Beaky not playing nicely.
  Agreed.
That's it, Beakman, I'm...erm...
I'm not playing with you anymore!
I'm not playing with YOU anymore either!
  Fine!
  Fine! Huh!
Daddy, you not playing nicely!
And you not playing nicely either, Uncle Beaky.
  When you play a game with a friend
  With a friend
  Somebody always win or lose
  It true
Sometimes, it no fun
When you not the bird who won
But no matter what... here's what you do
Play nicely
  Nicely?
  That right
  No yell at other birds
  No fight
It wouldn't hurt either of you...
To be polite
So, take our advice
Play nicely!
  Lovebird?
  Beakman.
Let's...play nicely.
All right!
Aww!
In fact, why don't we all play one more game together?
  A flying race!
  What a marvellous idea, Lovebird!
Riders, are you ready?
Oh, yes!
As a matter of fact, absolutely!
The first birds to fly to the top of the tree will win this trophy!
Ready?
Go!
This is it! The main event
The one I've been waiting for
Other races came and went
But this time, I'm going to soar!
My heart is beating there's sweat on my brow
The moment's fleeting so live in the now
  There's no retreating I've come too far to stop
I'll see you at the top!
Come on, Daddy, flap your wings
Give it all you've got!
Uncle Beaky, almost there
This is your big shot!
I've never flown so fast, so high
I never thought I could touch the sky
I'll keep on trying
Never giving up!
I'll see you at the...
Top of the world with my feathered family
  From your community
I never knew a bird could feel so free
  Lucky me!
  Almost at the finish line
  See you at the top
  Flying fast and feeling fine
  See you at the top
Sweet victory is mine
At the top, at the top
See you at the...
And it's a tie!
  A tie?
  A tie?
I just have one thing to say to you, Beakman...
Well done!
Amazing flying!
Oh, thank you, Lovebird,
but it was nothing compared to YOUR flying
  Congratulations.
  Congratulations to you, sir. Woo!
..See you at the top!
  Different is good.
  If we were all the same, it would be a shame
  Cos different is good
  Oh, yeah!
We wouldn't change it if we could
It's part of the neighbourhood
We're different
And different is good!
Ha ha!
