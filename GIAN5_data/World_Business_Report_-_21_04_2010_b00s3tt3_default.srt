found new supporters in the way of the recent financial crisis,
including Gordon Brown. This is a copy of the IMF's eagerly
awaited paper. How to get the financial sector to cover the
future cost of bail outs. We were able to get a copy of this report
just before the IMF prepares for its spring meeting. Two proposals

everyone in the financial sector. Hedge funds, Insurers will not be
exempt from this. Profits and renumeration other focus.   
remuneration are the focus. Internationally, it's not clear
what politicians will make of this but the IMF paper does move us one
step closer to a world where a tax on banks is increasingly likely.
We will keep a close eye on that situation. While staff at IMF
headquarters are thinking about big picture financial reform, the
organisation is also dealing with Greece. Talks begin in Athens over
the rescue package for the heavily indebted country. But talks have
been delayed by the travel chaos called by the Icelandic volcano.

by a thread to its fiscal independence. But today as a moment
of truth for this proud nation as it moves ever closer to pulling the

to maintain the facade that the combined cloud of the IMF and
European institutions will enable Greece to regain confidence of

left high and dry. Either it will borrow from the markets or row

further series of painful austerity measures which will be administered
by the hawks of the IMF. Greece was badly bitten when it sold off
nearly $2.7 billion worth of Treasury bills. It will have to
hand over 6.5% interest when it pays back the money in three
months' time. Greece can't afford to give investors and speculators
such a rich return. All the measures will not cover the extra
interest payments. The IMF and European negotiators have arrived

disruption to air travel. It has been dominating the news. Our
correspondent is in Singapore. She joins us on the line now. We spoke
yesterday   a lot more happening today?
Yes, Sally   in five minutes' time, the first Singapore Airlines flight
to Heathrow will depart this airport. At about seven o'clock
your time, another flight will be leaving this airport to London.
They normally have a free flights to London every day. Officials say
if those flights are successful, they will get more going. They will
be flying to Paris, Munich and Frankfurt as well.
It will take some time on shore before normality returns   what are
officials saying about that? It will be some time before it
returns to normal but never the less, it is a huge relief for
carriers such as Singapore Airlines. Reports suggest they were losing up
to $7 million a day so by returning to normal operations, it is a huge
relief. I understand people arriving in
Singapore from, say, Australia and New Zealand, they were sent back
home. Yes, most of them were sent back
home. They were told to rebook their flights when things calmed
down. There were thousands of people stuck in Singapore at the
airport and it is costing Singapore Airlines money to feed them and
accommodate them as well. Thank you for joining us and we
will speak to you again as the day progresses.
Now to some other stories in business. Fiat is going to unveil
its long awaited strategic review. Speculation they may announce plans
to spin off part of its business. Also, the World economic Outlook

Would you know what to do with few found a whale stranded on a beach?
Rescuing a beached Sea mammal is a highly complex operation.
We are standing on Sandgate beach in Kent and behind me, a team of
volunteers are inflating a plastic pilot whale. When it is full of sea
water, it will wait to map times. They are going to train how to get
a stranded whale like that one of the beach and back into the water.

how to refloat a stranded whale. It is not easy and in water like this,

be covering the reopening of Britain's airspace to commercial
flights. These are our top stories. After days of paralysis, planes
have started landing at Heathrow. The first time since volcanic ash
stopped air traffic across Europe six days ago.
Joyous reunions for many passengers. Airlines are starting the long
process of returning to their full schedules. There are still ongoing
problems. Although some flights have left Paris, Amsterdam and
Frankfurt, more than 100,000 flights were cancelled across
Europe in the past week and that will take some weeks to get all the
passengers home. Our correspondent has the latest from Madrid.
I've spoken to passengers who have made their way here for flights
from all over Europe. One couple I spoke to have been getting
different information from different sources and they decided
that the end, they were spending so much that they have flown here to
Madrid in the hope they can make contact with the Foreign Office
team or with embassy officials who have said they will use Madrid as a
hub to get people back from here to Britain at least. In other news,
flags are flying at half mast and public entertainment has been
suspended in China as the country marks a day of mourning for the
victims of last week's earthquake What should happen to Vienna's
anti aircraft towers? The city government wants to rent one out.
Some believe it should be open to the public as wartime memorials.
These anti aircraft towers were built during the Second World War.
Civilians took shelter inside them during bombing raids. Historians
believe their main purpose was propaganda. It was a sign of the
Mellor    military strength of the Third Reich.
Those bastions were intended to have guns. In 1943, authorities
already knew that Allied bombers flew higher so they were of no use.
If the flak towers were built by forced labour. On the walls you can
still see graffiti written by prisoners of war. This is one of
the few windows in the Tower, one of the main reasons why it is dark
and abandoned today. During the war, hundreds of Viennese would have
taken shelter here from the Allied bombing, waiting in the cold,
concrete halls for the all clear sound. There are six such towers in
Vienna. They would be very hard to destroy. One of the towers has been
made into an aquarium. Another is used by the army. There is
controversy about the fate of the others. There are plans to turn
this tower into a data storage centre, something that could bring
in money for the Vienna City Council.
Her the data centre must be kept safe from any kind of terrorism and
especially the flak towers, they have a very stable concrete. They
are located very well. A others believe the tower should
be open to the public to remind them of up a dark period in history.
I think in the political landscape it is important to show the young
people what the Second World War was an these buildings are so
strong inside that you can feel the horror of war.
At the moment, there are no clerks explaining the history of the
towers but their presence cannot be ignored.    plaque us.
As Britain lifted its nationwide flight ban, it was asked, why was
it ever imposed? British Airways have said that the unprecedented
six day shutdown was are necessary. Germany's admission    edition of
the Financial Times had reported that factories in Japan have closed
temporarily because of missing components.

Nick Clegg, the men who could pleased to BV    the man who could
prove to be... Starting off with the question that
has been bubbling along and has now come out.
If a I have to say, I think the airspace authorities say they are
damned if they do and damned if they didn't. I think they are
winning    in an extremely difficult situation. They felt they
were doing the right thing, obviously. There will always be
criticism from the airlines. Frankly, I think I would rather be
safe than sorry. I understand why they did what they did.
Will take a Nick Clegg    talk about    we will talk about Nick
Clegg soon. Will these airlines be able to get
anything back because of what happened? British Airways is
pushing hard down that road and saying we did not have the
opportunity to make our own choices. It will all come down to the
evidence. Will they deal to get anything back?    be able.
The German edition of the Financial Times highlights BMW parts, this is
across the board. The suspension of flights and their consequences.
We can see it in so many different areas. One of the biggest areas in
the market that has been hit his oil prices. Places like Brazil have
suddenly seen their currencies come under pressure. Secondary and
tertiary effects of this can be seen around the world.
Japan kept all their components in stock to the minimum because they
did not know about demand, sales and because they kept it low, when
the imports are not arriving and the components are not arriving,
they are in a predicament and they? Given the fact that the car
industry has been in for the last few years, they are in real strife.
The back to the flat tax. As a banker should and say much
about it. We want to know your true feelings.
A I don't think anyone is surprised that this has happened. It is a
general tax rather than a Tobin tax. It is interesting that they will go
to G20. G20 is a fractious set of nations anyway.
The Asians in particular will not like it. They will say, we were not
responsible for this meltdown. That is part of what happens in it
G20 anyway. There is a split between the developed world section
of G20 and the West. As a currency strategist, you have
been watching the euro like a hawk and today they will talk about the
detail on a bail out plan for Greece. Can they get there?
A guest telephones still work despite the ash. They will have to
coming up for redemption in Greece. Everybody realises they will
trigger a bail out mechanism and they will need to know within the
next week or so. Yes, they will go through.
Back to nick Clegg and the halo effect.
Clearly, there is a liberal surge. This is quite remarkable. If we go
back and look at previous Liberal governments, it changes politics
completely. Another one of the days where
watching need to wear in the morning is not what you need to
wear in the afternoon. After a cold and frosty start, the temperature
recovers. Across the United Kingdom, it is a blue sky start. It is still
initially brisk with the wind and into northern Scotland. Shall was
will start dry. Scattered showers in northern Scotland and watch out
for a few icy patches from showers overnight. Southern Scotland, lots
of sunshine to begin on    with. You have sunshine across northern
England for breakfast time as we do across southern England. As we look
into Wales, barely a cloud in the sky. A lovely day to come here.
Moving on through the day, seeing how the weather develops, for
Norfolk, still the odd shower around. There will be sunny spells
in between. Elsewhere, it will be dry enough. Patchy fair weather
reasonably light breeze. Entering Wednesday evening, it turns cold
once again. Hole against Villa, take note of the temperature
dropping away.    whole. By day, there will be a great deal of
