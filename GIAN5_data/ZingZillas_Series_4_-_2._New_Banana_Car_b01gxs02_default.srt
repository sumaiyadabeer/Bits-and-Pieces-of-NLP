What shall we play today, DJ?
Press the button and let's find out!
Ah, button.
Todd, yay!
Oh, hello, ZingZillas.
Oh, Todd, have you done it? Have you finished my banana car?
Um...a few minor adjustments. Soon be ready.
Oh! Ready for the Big Zing?
Well, there won't be a Big Zing if we don't know what to sing about.
My machine will have you the perfect song in a moment, young Tang. Oh!
Phew! That was close!
Oh!
Uh oh! TV broken!
Now what are we going to sing about?
Well, you can decide.
I'll make sure Todd gets my banana car ready for the Big Zing!
Laters!
Coconut!
You're right, Drum. We'd better get a monkey move on!
Oh! Look out, everybody,
it's coconut number one.
Only three more to go to the Big Zing!
Welcome to The Glade. This is Urban Strawberry Lunch.
  Oh!
  Can you see?
They're playing all sorts of instruments
made out of all sorts of things.
Some of the instruments are even made
  using the bits and bobs from old cars!
  Hee hee!
Ooh! Drum love bits and pieces instruments.
  Big Zing! Big Zing! Bye, DJ.
  Bye, Drum.
Oh, here it comes.
It is coconut number two.
Only two more to go until the Big Zing.
Ah, my banana car is going to look Zing a licious in the Big Zing.
Todd has just got to finish fixing the spare parts to it.
Ooh, Drum hear cool sound in the glade.
Oh, zinging beat, Drum.
Add a bit of bass and we have the perfect sound for the Big Zing!
New banana car
It's my new banana car
I'll be driving very far in my new banana car
New banana car Doesn't matter who you are
I'll be looking like a star in my new banana car.
  Hello, ZingZillas!
  Hey, Todd!
I've fixed the TV.
What about my banana car?
Don't worry. I'll sort your banana car out tomorrow, Zak.
Over and out.
Over and out?
I can't sing New Banana Car without my new banana car.
Uh oh! No banana car...
no Big Zing!
Oh dear, ZingZillas.
Just when we thought nothing could go wrong.
I hear another coconut about to fall.
Here we go again.
It's coconut number three.
Only one more to go to the Big Zing.
  Come on, Zak, push!
  Don't worry, Zak.
Four ZingZillas will have your banana car
ready for the Big Zing in no time.
  Thank you.
  Let's do it!
Oh, thanks, ZingZillas. It's perfect!
We're ready to play!
Ooh, and only just in time...
because it's the last coconut!
  Cool cape!
  Feather boa!
  Groovy hat!
  Wings!
It's time for the Big Zing!
It's that time of the day when we like to say,
it's Big Zing time!
So take it away.
Hi, everybody! I have a really cool banana car
to go with our cool song all about driving.
But first we are going to need some monkey moves from you.
Are you ready, Zing Boppers?
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Then let's do it!
Down the street with a pedal at your feet
With a pedal at your feet in the driving seat
With a funky furry feel to the steering wheel
New banana car It's my new banana car
I'll be driving very far in my new banana car
New banana car Doesn't matter who you are
I'll be looking like a star in my new banana car
Left and right with a super flashing light
With a super flashing light you can see at night
Sleek and fast with the jungle whizzing past
With the jungle whizzing past here it is at last
My new banana car It's my new banana car
I'll be driving very far in my new banana car
New banana car Doesn't matter who you are
I'll be looking like a star in my new banana car...
Banana, banana, banana car
Banana, banana, banana car
Banana, banana, banana car
Banana, banana, banana car
New banana car It's my new banana car
I'll be driving very far in my new banana car
New banana car Doesn't matter who you are
I'll be looking like a star in my new banana car
  Hey!
  New banana car It's my new banana car
I'll be driving very far in my new banana car
New banana car Doesn't matter who you are
I'll be looking like a star in my new banana car.
That's it from ZingZilla Island for today.
Come and see us all again very soon.
