year old who's clocked up 72 years Good evening. A mother from Chatham
who's admitted taking part in an attack on a teenager has been
spared a jail sentence, because he'd been abusing her severely
disabled daughter over the internet. Sylvia Hooper went round to
Christopher Berwick's house in Chatham with other members of her
Facebook. Sylvia pleaded guilty to assault, but a Crown Court judge
handed her a conditional discharge because of exceptional
circumstances. Jon Hunt reports. Tim Hooper has just turned 21. She
has been studying GCSEs at college. Like many people her age, she uses
Facebook to keep in touch with friends. One of her former friends
used the site to aggressively taught her about her disability.
was calling me names, I could deal with that. But he always put
something aggressive about it me. He called me a retard. He said,
also, that no one would want me because I am always in that thing.
By thing, I take it he means the chair. Happily was Christopher
Berwick from Chatham. His cruel comments left her depressed and
suicidal. Her mother, along with a friend and family, went round to
his house and assaulted him. Some people would say, you should never
take the law into your own hands. The police should have done their
job. To me, the system failed her, what was I meant to do? Mrs Hooper,
her son and friend pleaded guilty to assault. During the case,
Christopher had called    the court heard that Christopher had called
her a cripple. Judges will always take very seriously any case where
someone has taken the law into their own hands. People who do that,
bring themselves down to the level of criminals. But you cannot really
have a blanket policy of just sending everyone to present in that
type of case, you have got to allow for individual circumstance.
Kent police say they have no records of any calls from their
Kim is backing what her family did. Any parent of a disabled daughter
would react in the same way. Any brother would react in the same way.
Our reporter John joins us from Chatham. This family could be   
could have expected to get a jail sentence?
They pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm, a crime that can
attract a sentence up to five years in prison. Christopher Berwick was
punched so hard he then left with the imprint of his attacker's wing
in his face. Because of the exceptional circumstances, the
judge issued sentences of a conditional discharge and community
penalties. There are two victims in this case, Kim, abused over
Facebook, and Christopher, the Facebook abuser who was punched in
the face. He refused to comment today.
On BBC Radio Kent's breakfast programme tomorrow, John and Claire
will have interviews on this story with the Chairman of the Criminal
Bar Association and the chief executive of the charity Beat
Bullying. Eurotunnel is facing the threat of
strike action over the Bank Holiday weekend after French unions
demanded a sharp pay rise. The company says it's suspended taking
further return bookings for this coming Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
Simon Jones is in Folkestone. Simon, this couldn't come at a worse time
for the company. That is right. This weekend is set to be one of
the busiest travel weekend of the year. You have got families
returning from the summer holidays ahead of the start of the new
school year. You have also got people wanted to head over to
France to enjoy the long weekend. Eurotunnel is due to carry 100,000
passengers over the bank holiday. The problem is, four unions in
France have made a pay increase demand of 8%. The unions say if
this not agreed to by Friday, they will begin indefinite strike action.
Eurotunnel says it simply cannot meet this demand in the current
economic climate. Travel experts say this is a big problem for the
company. I fear this will cause some significant damage to the
cross Channel market as a whole. One reason people choose to travel
to Calais by ferry or by Eurotunnel is because, frankly, it is a lot
more civilised than the airline alternative of. It will disrupt
potentially tens of thousands of British holidaymakers returning
home. It is going to be a major disruption. What have Eurotunnel
said? Eurotunnel is suggesting it will be able to run services as
normal, because it is the French workers going on strike. They say
the British workers will be able to fill in behind them, driving the
trains, and even at manning the terminal in France. I understand,
today, there have been emergency meetings taking place in Dover
between the ferry companies and port bosses with a plan of
introducing extra ferry services of the worst so there    if the worst
scenario emerges is. In a moment: Left to rot, the
Kentish farmers warning the plum industry could be killed off by
cheap foreign imports. Doctors in Kent are trialling a new
treatment that could transform the lives of thousands of patients
whose awareness of their left side has been affected by a stroke.
150,000 people suffer from strokes in Britain each year. As many as a
quarter of them could benefit from the new treatment, which is being
funded by a �310,000 grant from the Medical Research Council. Sara
Smith has this report. When Stephen suffered a huge stroke
more than two years ago, he was left paralysed on one side and in
hospital for eight months. Gradually, some movement did return,
but one thing remained badly affected. Although his eyes were
not damaged, his brain could not recognise anything to his left.
it is on my left hand side, my balance is not very good, and I
would be forever falling over and I worry about breaking my hips.
could only shake on the right hand side, I had to shave the other side.
Your tablets, wasn't it, if I put the tablets on his left hand side,
he would not be aware they were there. He would not into people, I
would be forever apologising, because he would not see them. But
it does not look like he cannot see them. But this little machine has
made a big difference to Stephen's life. Developed in collaboration
between the Kent and Canterbury Hospital and the University of Kent,
it delivers a small electric current to the nerve behind the ear.
Parties connected to a system which controls balance, and that in turn
stimulates the temporal lobe on the damaged right side of the brain,
reawakening its awareness of those things on the left. We have seen
some significant benefits. So, our goal now is to try and this   
tried this on a much larger people to see if the benefits we have
shown in those benefit are more widespread. Simple drawing tests
showed just how some much    just so much people are affected.
vision is OK, but his brain is not receiving the left side of the
world. But since his treatment, Stephen's left hand world is coming
back to him. I have got a mobility scooter, I can go out all the time
because I have got more attention to the path    to my left hand side.
The new trial will find that if others can benefit as much.
A woman in her 50s has died after being hit by a car in north Kent.
The woman suffered fatal injuries during the incident near a
McDonald's restaurant on Cobham Terrace in Greenhithe shortly
before 7:30 this morning. Police are appealing for witnesses.
Police are continuing their appeal for help to identify a man who's
been found suffering from complete memory loss. The man, who's in his
late 50s to early 60s, claims to have woken up on a beach in Deal in
Kent last Wednesday. He then walked into the town's Victoria hospital
saying he had head pains and amnesia.
CCTV images have been released by the British Transport Police of
people they want to talk to after a number of alleged crimes on our
railways. They're looking for this man after a woman had her phone and
camera stolen on a train between Crowborough and London Bridge. And
they want to speak this man after a woman was punched in the face
travelling from Brighton to Worthing. And they're searching for
these people after a man had his computer stolen at Strood station.
A British lorry driver who smuggled more than 6 million cigarettes
through Dover has been jailed for four and a half years. 45 year old
Colin Beattie was found guilty of evading more than �1 million in
excise duty following an investigation by Revenue and
Customs. He was caught in 2009 after travelling from Calais by
ferry. Two people have been arrested
following a fire in Rochester. 13 people were rescued from a block of
flats off Gravel Walk in the town just after midnight. A man and a
woman were arrested in the early hours of this morning on suspicion
of arson with intent to endanger life, and are currently in police
custody. Lynda Hardy reports. Back at his block of flats from

have started in the ground floor filled the building with smoke.

Residents are not being allowed back here for the foreseeable
future, after their home, a place which is now a crime scene. The

is premature to see    say when residents can get back in.
safety checks continue, those who live here face another night in a
hotel or staying with friends and relatives, uncertain when they will
be allowed to return home. It is 6:40pm. A mother from Chatham
who has admitted taking part on an attack on a teenager has been
spared attendance because he had been so dealing    abusing her
severely disabled daughter over the internet.
Also in tonight's programme: 72 years in the job. The 90 year

And blooming marvellous, the pictures of mums to be that are
winning awards for a Sussex It's the height of the British plum
season, and in Kent, where half of all English plums are grown,
they've got a bumper crop. But tonnes of perfectly good plums
could be left to rot because growers say supermarkets are
importing cheaper fruit from Europe. The National Farmers Union says it
could lead to the end of the British plum industry. Rebecca
Barry has the latest in our Food Chain series.
Dumped and left to rot. This could be the fate of tons of plums are
produced in Kent because farmers cannot sell them to supermarkets.
Several growers have not bothered even picking their fruit because
there was not a market. They were told they could not sell it, which
is a very sad occasion for Kent. We have fantastic plum crops. We are
the garden of England but we are not allowed to sell it. Here, the
fruit is kept in cold stores. If they do not sell it soon, it will
be thrown away. A punnet of Victoria plums like these are
produced in Kent will cost supermarkets 65p. They can get them
from abroad for as little as 45p. That means of tonnes of crude like
this will simply go to waste. Samarkand farmers are even planning
to rip up their plum trees to start again with a different crop.   
some Kent farmers. We are at the height of the English plum season.
I was in a supermarket yesterday, there were plums from Sweden   
France and Spain but there were no English plums. We have a bumper
crop of beautiful British fruit available right now, and consumers
are not being given the opportunity to buy British trick. So we went to
look for ourselves. Sainsbury's had won a variety of Kent plums, but
three others from Spain, France and Portugal. At Tesco, we had Kent
plums and also some from Portugal. Is the pressure for a bigger
profits squeezing out bigger growers? I do not accept that.
There are Kentish plums out there, they are great value, go into the
shop and look for them, they are on promotion, buy them and we will
sell even more. If not, this could be the picture across Kent, where
half of England's plums are grown At 6.30 this morning, as ever, Yve
Moore was first to arrive at her office. Some of you may think
that's remarkable in itself but when you learn that she is 90 years
old, it becomes pretty amazing. Yve has worked for the same legal firm
in Folkestone since she was a teenager in the 1930s and 72 years
later, she remains a vital and valued member of the team. Robin
Gibson reports. She has seen more of these stairs
than anyone in the building, because Yve Moore came to work here
for just six months in 1939, and she is still holding her own, both
at work and on these stairs, 72 She is an important part of the way
the office runs. She is still a significant member of our staff.
She has got an enormous amount of experience and knowledge which we
rely on and draw on every day. So, really, we cannot think of being
without her. It keeps me active, rather than, you know, growing like
a cabbage! Her story sets the current debate on retirement at 65
or even 70 on its head. I did retire for half a day. Half a day?
You actually said, I am retiring? said, I am going to retire, but
they said, come back, we wanted to do this and that, and we stayed.
Yve is no slouch. By 6:20pm, every day, she sets off down the garden
path to walk to work. At 6:30am, she is first to arrive at the
office and has done a lot of work before anyone else is even in the
building. She has always been one for routine. The young secretary
posing in the office garden has matured, in a way, into its heart
and soul. She has got a wonderful memory. She has got a good sense of
humour. She may be 90, but I think we forget she is 90. Every decade
past is greeted with a party. So where will it all again? I will be
here until I am chucked out, or can't come in!
We have got lots of respect for Yve, I do not know why she does    I do
not know how she does it! Brighton and Hove Albion's great
start to the season continued last night as the Seagulls kicked
Premier League Sunderland out of the Carling Cup with an extra time
victory at The Amex. Charlton will join them in the third round after
beating Reading, but Crawley are out after their defeat by Crystal
Palace. Ian Palmer reports. Brighton have had some sweet
victories of late but this is right up there with the best of them. 90
minutes couldn't separate the Seagulls from Sunderland, so extra
time followed. Six minutes later it took the head of the new signing
Craig Mackail Smith to put Brighton into the third round of the
competition. The manager Gus Poyet praised his team's performance but
warned them not to get ahead of themselves. We need to keep things
calm. We have had a dream start. Every week, it is getting better
and bigger. At the same time, we do not want to think we are too good.
And get a bad result in three or four days. We need to make sure we
keep playing like we are. neutrals say Brighton deserved
their win. Mackail Smith coming close with an earlier effort in
normal time. Sunderland's best chance came soon after the start.
Brighton's unbeaten record continues. The final score 1 0.
Charlton are also unbeaten. Their match against Reading ended 2 1 to
the Addicks. It's a major scalp given Reading were Championship
finalists last year. Paul Benson opened the account after 25 minutes.
Jason Euell scored the second after the break. Reading pulled one back
to make it a rather nervy end. The final score 2 1. It wasn't a happy
evening for Crawley Town. They were beaten 2 nil by Crystal Palace. The
Red Devils started well with a number of well crafted attempts but
Zaha ensured the night belonged to the home side. Crawley never gave
up though. That attitude will serve the League Two side well later in
the season. The final score 2 0 to Crystal Palace.
And you can see extended highlights of all the Carling Cup matches
later tonight on The League Cup Show at 11.30 here on BBC One.
East Grinstead striker Ashley Jackson has helped England thrash
France to reach the semi finals of the European Hockey Championships
in Germany. Jackson grabbed a hat  trick in an impressive 8 1 victory
that sets up a likely clash on Friday against hosts Germany for a
place in the final. And good luck to Natalie Seymour from Canterbury,
along with her England colleagues, as they take on Netherlands
tomorrow in their european championships semi final.
When a pregnant Demi Moore posed naked for the cover of a magazine,
it caused a sensation. Since then celebrities including Halle Berry,
Monica Belucci and most recently Mylene Klass have all recreated her
pose. Now a Sussex photographer who specialises in taking pictures of
pregnant women and their newborn babies has been named the South
East's Master Photographer of the year. Sarah Tate from Heathfield is
now in the running for a national title. Claudia Sermbezis reports.
Let's get him in position first so he is nice and comfy. Keep his arm
there if you want to. They beat Scott is six days old, but this is
his second visit to Serie    Sarah Tate's studio. Last time, he was
not born. Now one of Sarah's images has been chosen as the best in the
South East. The pregnancy one, that one just stood out immediately, as
soon as I started editing it. The look on her face, the way she was
standing was lovely. It is something that I work for every
year. So to act to resubmit it, and then, one of the most prestigious
judges, a for him to actually pick my images and state some lovely
things about them was an ageing    amazing pulled Judi was eight and 
a half months pregnant when she decided to have her photo taken.

marks overnight! The fashion for photographing pregnant women took
off three it    20 years ago after Demi Moore stripped off to show her
burgeoning band. I saw them in a magazine, and that is probably what
convinced me what it looked like. It was a really iconic image. I
think we have got one with Julie, it is a really good shop which will
go in our bedroom, because she does not want to show the rest of the
House! It will take pride of place. That is lovely, well done. Sarah
has also won an award for best children's portrayed with this shot.

we like to bring the at 6:30pm, It was quite a great start to the
day,    quite a grey start. Mostly dry, into tomorrow, we will see a
heavy rain and light winds. It will be feeling cooler than today. Today,
initially we saw some showers first thing. They have been clearing. It

Despite the breezes, it has felt a good deal warmer than yesterday. As
we move through the first part of the evening, and nice, fine and
bright evening. It stays dry into tonight, but the cloud cover will
be thickening. We will see rain at first thing tomorrow. Tonight, it
stays dry, quite a mild night. Initially, a dry starts to tomorrow.
Very quickly, the rain will be spreading across the South East,
some heavier pulses of living that. Because the breezes are fairly
light, is will not be moving quickly. Temperatures similar to
today but feeling cooler under that cement    unsettled weather.
Tomorrow night, that rate will clear up east.    the rain will
clear it east. We will have further rain pushing in it from the south.
Some heavier horses.    some heavy horses. Unfortunately for Festival
Friday, it is looking fairly grotty. Take your umbrella as if you were
going along. That rain will be clearing, but it will be a dull
picture. Sorry about that! The area of low pressure is going to be
moving in across the south east, eventually clearing away. By the
time we get to the weekend, high pressure building from the south 
west. The Iraq showers on Saturday but increasingly bright on Sunday.
I am ignoring the end of that bulletin! I will be dusting off my
wet suit. This week, we are going to Herne Bay.
When the sun is shining and summer is in full swing, there is nothing
better than getting out of the office to the seaside and that is
exactly what we are doing every Friday in August. We are entering
you at some of the biggest summer celebrations across Kent and Sussex.
We will be live on location each battle Friday and we would love as
many of you as possible to come along and join in the fund.
Bring your raincoat and join us this Friday at Herne Bay!
