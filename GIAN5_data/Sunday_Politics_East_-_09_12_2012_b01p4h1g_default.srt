Here in the East, the MP who finally succeeded in getting the
fuel duty escalator scrapped. And, a blight or a blessing? Would
Welcome to Sunday Politics, I'm Etolle George.
Later, controversy over planning decisions to build solar farms on
prime agricultural land. The price of localism, which was given to
communities in at the last election, has promised    has proven to be
but false promise. And George Osborne grunts the wishes of this
MP, and makes the dream of motorists come true. Fuel duty
affects every man and woman in the country because it impacts on food
prices and transport prices. It is a toxic tax, and the Government has
said, we have at Palma de Mallorca rises.
First let's meet our guests, Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge,
Julian Huppert, and Peter Bone, the Conservative MP for Wellingborough.
Let's begin with the news that the boss of the first private company
2004. The company took over the running of Hinchingbrooke Hospital
in Huntingdon in February. It has incurred a �4 million deficit in
its first six months. Steve Melton is taking Mr Parsa's place as
interim chief executive. patients expect us to fix the
quality first. Meanwhile, behind the scenes we are working on long 
term sustainable economics. This is a ten year contract, and we are in
our first year. So we are absolutely focused on getting
quality right first, and then a sustainable hospital in economic
terms second. Julian Huppert, are you reassured, or are there alarm
bells ringing? There are definitely alarm bells.
There have been problems with a hospital for a long time. People
who live there have to face the uncertainty for many years. This
approach of having a private company running it is an
interesting approach. I hope it works out, because what is more
important than any discussion is what sort of health care do people
get when they need it? Peter, what about private companies running it?
The quality is what matters first. Let us but the economics second. It
would have been wrong if they cut the quality of service to make the
books balance. In the NHS, the one thing that seems wrong is that we
broke    wobbly too much about balancing the books... But don't we
have to think about balancing the books? If you are taking over a
hospital that has not been run very well, met us but the quality right
first. This Chief Executive may have resigned, but he will still
have to go in front of the select committee, so the public accounts
committee will look into that.   is it a time for experimenting?
can understand why three or four years ago the then Government
decided to stay but trying something different. Do you think
it will be followed elsewhere? it works well. If not, we will have
to say that was a mistake and it should not have happened. The key
is the quality, and what happens to patients. The industrialisation of
our countryside is an allegation that levelled at the growing number
of solar farm is in our region. Many have been given the go ahead
without applications being discussed more widely. Opponents
say the Government's determination to make green targets is at the
expense of our countryside. Solar farms, the answer to our
energy woes, or at desecration of the countryside? The height, there
is going to be 40,000 panels over this area. It will absolutely
transform the landscape. 35 years here are coming to an end for Roger
and his family. They are selling up, musing, they say, a quarter of the
value of their farm    home. this is a rural setting, and it is
being turned into an industrial setting. In at a world where we
cannot feed the people on the planet, we should not be taking
agricultural land out of use. This is driven entirely by subsidies. If
you think about it practically, we do not need energy in the middle of
the summer when it these panels will be producing the main energy,
we need it in the depths of the winter. Be owner of the land
declined to comment, but the Government says that if planning
applications do not adversely impact on the environment, they
should be approved. Proposals for solo farms like this one in Weston
Longville can simply be decided on by his single planning officer.
They do not have to be discussed at council meetings. Once given the
go ahead, there is not a lot anybody opposed to the plans can go,
unless they are willing to take proceedings to the High Court.
Going to a High Court is extremely expensive, and David Cameron has
recently announced that he is going to become    it is going to become
more expensive and more difficult. That means that the promise of
localism, which was given to local communities in the run up to the
last election, has proven to be a false promise, one at that has not
been kept to. The Prime Minister has twisted the localism agenda to
sit other purposes. Lack energy has just got approval for the country's
largest solar farm. Much of what you see in the countryside has been
grown for energy. Solo it is a far more effective use of the land.
Opponents argue Solar farms are expensive, that solar energy cannot
be stored, and that we get it when we need it least. But farmers say
it makes economic sense. We are in it to make a profit, but also there
is a need for food and energy, and water, and farmers have to do the
best they can and diversify. current spate of solar forms take
advantage of a terrace that are expected to change in the spring.
The reason there is a rush to get some of those sold of forms
completed by the end of March is that everybody is aware that the
Government is going to change the support but Solar receives in April.
At the moment we do not know what that support level will be.
level of support Solar Energy receives from the Government may
determine whether this becomes the landscape of the future.
Dunion, is it right that these decisions do not go before for
council? Are unsurprised there is not a role for a planning committee
involvement. In Cambridge City Council, the normal thing would be
that the planning application would go to an area committee. People
should have a say. Having said that, as we panned out from that image,
from further away I thought the solar farm it looked very much like
another farm. Bit is not growing food, though. It is not, and the
world does actually produce enough food to feed everybody, but we do
not produce it in at the right places. We can have a balance
between eight    energy creation and food grows from. If people are
concerned about having these farms built near by, the only recourse is
going to the High Court. That is completely undemocratic. We said we
were going to bring in that localism, but local councils were
going to decide, and the recent White local councils are proving
these things is that because if they do not approve them, the
development will go to appeal, and the council will have cost awards
did against it. The Government has to do what it said it would do,
have localism. The reason we do not have it is because the Liberal
Democrats are in favour of this wishy washy climate change rubbish.
Liberal Democrats claimed to be Democrats, but here it they want a
centralised Government, Stalinist control. Beta is wrong on this. We
are keener on that vocalist decision making. The fact that we
have to generate energy and be in favour of localism. Are you in
favour of letting local councils make decisions? A set at the
beginning that I am keen that local councils should be involved. I want
to come back to our point that you made about the fact that you said
it looked like any other form. Some would say this is building on
greenfield and turning green field into brownfield. I can understand
their concerns about that. I thought the farmer's comment was
good. We have to supply food, and energy. We need to do far more on
energy efficiency, and that is not talked about enough. The best thing
to do is not to build accord plant, a gas plant... A gentleman, what is
to stop these solar farms from popping up all over the place?
does not matter what the local council says. If Gillian it was
right that local councils could turn these damn, that is fine. But
if they turn them down, they are automatically... A I think the key
thing is what level the subsidy is at. I would like to see a gradual
phasing out of subsidies. Hydro  Electric does not require a subsidy
now, because it is a mature technology. Peter Bone, it is your
Government that has brought in at the east terrace. It is the
wretched Liberal Democrats who are forcing us to do it. But am going
to campaign to have Tory values in this, and real localism. We also
have a responsibility to our cells and the planet to make sure we have
somewhere that is worth living in ten, 20 years. If we do not do
something about climate change, our grandchildren will have far worse
things than a solar farm are being built in the countryside. This
week's Autumn Statement. How was it for you? The Chancellor had to
admit that austerity will continue until 2018, and that will mean a
more spending cuts and a squeeze on all our budgets. But there were a
few crumbs of comfort. Super fast broadband for Cambridge, and that
announcement about fuel duty. From college yards of
Northamptonshire to the isolated villages of the Fens, the rising
price of fuel has become a major issue. In a mini budget which had
little to shout about, this was the announcement to delight MPs.
typical motorist in Kettering will from January be paying �5 less
every time they fill up at the pump. Can I thank my honourable friend of
my half of my colleagues for putting up the fuel back into the
tank... Be MP for Harlow has spent the last two years leading the
campaign against fuel duty. Finally he says, the Government has got the
message. The fuel duty affects everybody, especially those in
white vans who are trying to go to work. It also affects those taking
buses. But the price of fuel is not coming down. No we also want fuel
duty cuts, but I am happy that they have frozen fuel duty, a permanent
freeze, not just a three month freeze. Two long awaited road
schemes were approved, one for the Afive in Bedfordshire and another
widening scheme for their M25. Cambridge will get ultra fast
broadband, but there is also funding for research and biocides.
And extra money for the Regional Growth Fund. All this on top of
funding announced in it earliest    earlier budgets for the Dr Foster
end of the meat and A14. We have to rebuild an economic model. I am so
excited about our science base, it will not create jobs overnight but
it will build a sustainable future. Do is was also the week when the
Chancellor had to announce further austerity measures, affecting all
of us. There will be less money for policing and local councils, and
benefits will rise less than the rate of inflation. In last week's
programme, we visited the Milton Keynes phone bank. There've    food
bank. We have had a 20% increase on our demand and services this year,
I can see it being in the same next year if not more. There are people
who really want to try and find work at the moment, there are small
businesses struggling. That is what we should be prioritising, not a
tax cut for millionaires which seems to be George Osborne's out of
touch priority. Next year at bay will start work on a widening to
the A14 in Cambridgeshire. Peter Bone, are you happy about the
fuel announcement? I thought it was a pretty good autumn statement.
Every time you fill your tank, you will be saving �5. That is a real
significance saving for hard  working families. For many people,
especially people on benefits, it was not a good autumn statement.
Benefits are going up. The idea they are being cut in cash terms is
wrong. I listened, and because of the Labour Party we are in this
mess. Given the cards that the Chancellor had, I think it was a
pretty good statement. Why of the best things about the Autumn
Statement was what was not in it. I have been pushing hard against the
idea that David Cameron proposed, I think it would be lucky but much
look lovely that people could live in    live in a stable family, but
I am pleased we have cut back on the number of cuts. Are you not as
a party claiming a lot of credit for the parts of the Autumn
Statement that are benefiting lower income families? That is not
terribly coalition? There is no surprise that we have different
priorities from the Conservatives. Peter and I disagree on a number of
things. We are very pleased about reducing the amount of money that
is being raided from welfare, we are very pleased we have managed to
go further in terms of lifting poorly paid people out of income
tax. Does that mean you are the good guys and the Conservatives are
the bad guys? He always thinks that! We have a set of things we
try to fight for, and that will continue through future Autumn
Statement. Peter, you said it was a good statement. What about the
gentleman at the food bank, he said a 20% increase in people wanting
help. What about the language of the Chancellor, talking about the
jobless being feckless and workshy? He made it clear that was a
misrepresentation of his views. We are in a complete economic mess,
that is for sure, and it is difficult for everyone. I am not
saying we will not be having food banks in Wellingborough. But the
coalition Government but doing their best to get us out of this
mess in that the most equitable way. To be fair to the Chancellor, I
think the Government have done a pretty good job this time. What
about this ultra fast broadband for Cambridge? I think that is exciting.
Parts of Cambridge already have good Connectivity, and working
together with the County Council we should be able to roll out better
connections with some of the rural areas. That is a good thing from
the Autumn Statement. The idea of Wi Fi across Cambridge City means
that people will be able to work anywhere. Then there is the �6
million in the research and innovation budgets. B Tech, a new
road to link the Afive to the M1. When I drove past the huge new link
road to Corby, I bought a serious effort into getting the bypass
built. The Chancellor is recognising that are important
infrastructure projects that are now going ahead which previously
have been stopped. That is a good sign. A I have criticised the
Chancellor before for not putting enough investment into capital, and
it is good that he is making good steps.
By now, it is all up in the air. 60 seconds. A new call for a second
runway to be built at Stansted Airport this week came from the
boss of Gatwick. And then, in due course, to have a second runway at
Stansted. A more traditional form of transport for Matthew Hancock,
named as Sports Parliamentarian of the Year for promoting horse racing.
rule to argue that it was time to scrap the Human Rights Act.
supranational court can impose its will against ours, and in my view
this is fundamentally undemocratic. Good news for a school in Essex,
that the Essex County Council has allocated �8.4 million to build a
new school, and may I thank him for his support for that campaign?
bad tidings for 50 disabled workers in Norwich, whose jobs are under
threat after news that the Remploy packaging plant failed to find a
B Tech, what about Stansted Airport? We do welcome a second
runway? We need much more aviation capacity. A second runway, I am not
so sure. I do think we need to increase airport capacity as soon
as possible, as Stansted I am not so sure. Let us see it closer to
capacity before we think about that. Is it any more pie in the sky it
than that Boris Ireland? Stay Unsted simply    Stansted is
running at half capacity. People don't seem to be, there are other
schemes, but this one is sticking a round. By air is currently space
for 60% increase in passenger numbers around the country without
building any new terminals or runways. It does not make sense to
start building new runways in an airport that is not being used.
