  Ready, Gnasher?
  Yes, yes!
  Let's go!
Is highly overrated
Unstoppable, unstoppable, yeah
They can't hold us back
We'll make the most of every second
Unstoppable, unstoppable, yeah
After all is said and done
Shout one for all and all for one
Open up your eyes, the world outside is waiting.
Captain Yolk of the Starship Egg terprise,
I have lost several crew members
to a terrifying life form known as...the spoon!
"Huh, what's that? It's one of them."
"I come in peace."
"No o o o o!"
"Aaa agh agh!"
Ha ha ha ha ha!
How many times have I told you, Dennis?
Don't play with your food.
You don't mind when Gran does it.
Attention!
Yes, well, she's only staying here until her foot gets better.
That's right.
Meanwhile, you don't mind looking after Harley, right, Dennis?
Who's Harley?
  My hog.
  The pig.
Sounds like fun to me. Can't wait to meet him, Gran.
You will, when you go and feed him.
Hey, check out my glasses, ho ho ho!
Oh!
Fancy mistaking a hog for a hog.
  A what?
  A pig for a motorbike.
That's the problem with the internet.
You never quite know what you're going to get.
True, but if she decided to keep the pig,
why didn't she buy a home for it, you know, a sty?
She did try to build a sty.
And dropped a brick on her foot.
Meanwhile, the pig's running around all over the place.
Aaagh, ow!
A ha!
You've found my spares, I wondered where they were. Ta!
Right, I'm off to feed Harley.
There's some leftover cabbage in the kitchen.
Pooh ah, eugh, what a pong!
Make sure he's got clean water.
Will do, Gran. Come on, boy.
Rarr arr!
All right, stay and keep Gnipper company. I'll see you in a bit.
Come on, boys.
Let's see if anyone's noticed that I put salt in the sugar bowl.
Cough cough, pooh!
Ho ho ho ho!
OK, Harley, here's your swill.
Oi, steady on!
Wah!
Watch out!
All right, mate.
Yeah...see you later then.
Bye!
Oh, no! The bucket!
Me again, fella.
  Just come back to get the...
Wah!
Sad little Dennis looks at it on the floor,
all up the walls, and all over his face and says,
"Me never wanted stupid birthday cake anyway."
Really?
Brilliant! That's great.
Tell us another one.
Oh, yes, Dennis was a real handful when he was a baby.
Oh, hello, love.
How's Harley?
Oh, a bit lively. As you can see.
Mmm. Smells nice in here.
Oh, yeah, Gran made a pie.
Delicious.
So, are you guys ready for band practice?
Bring it on!
Er...isn't that my jacket?
Yes, it's great, isn't it?
Oh! Time for a break I think.
Oh, yeah, I'm ready for a break.
Oh, yeah. Right.
  Oh.
  It's probably past Harley's feeding time.
Eh? Oh...
OK, Gran.
Come on, lads, you can give me a hand with the pig.
You go, Dennis, your friends can catch up with you.
Oh... All right.
See you in a bit.
I haven't played one of these since...
Well, I've never played one of these.
But it's never too late to learn.
One, two, three, four!
Oh... Here's some fertiliser
  for your rhubarb.
  Wha...?
Well, thanks, Den. Wait a minute. I thought you were...
Who's playing my guitar?
Wow!
I see your foot's better.
Ur... Oh...
Well, actually, it doesn't hurt when I do this
but if... Oooh.
If I just walk like this...
Oh, the pain!
Right(!)
I thought you two were too tired to keep on rocking?
We are now.
Your gran has even more energy than you do, Den.
Mmm.
Come on, boy. Let's go and read some comics.
And there might be a doggy treat in it for you too.
Ruff! Ruff!
Gran!
What are you doing?
Oi! That was the last sausage!
Oh, never mind. It's pretty much done.
Gran!
You shouldn't make a fire in here.
You could've burnt down my treehouse.
I don't know about that.
It took me ages to get it going in the first place.
I had to use all that paper there.
My comics!
You...set fire to...my comics!
You don't need comics.
I'll tell you a funny bedtime story.
It's...not...my...bedtime.
Is it not?
Ah, well, we'll have a laugh in the morning, eh?
Ahhh!
Oh! Oh!
Here, boy!
  Night!
  What?
You can't stay here. This isn't a granny flat.
It's my treehouse. My treehouse!
Well, at least that's over for this morning.
Dennis! Your gran says don't forget to give Harley his chewable vitamin.
Wah! Arghh!
Pesky pig.
Smelly swine.
Pot bellied pest.
Hi, lads. What's going on?
Just tidying up. Your gran asked me to.
What are you doing, Pie Face?
Running up some curtains for the treehouse.
Your gran showed me how.
Right! That's it!
I've had enough. If anyone wants me, I'll be in my room.
Oh...
Curly! What are you doing there?
I had to get away.
Oh, I thought you were hanging out with Gran.
I was. I love your gran. She's so funny.
She had me drumming for hours yesterday.
I'm worn out. All of this fun is starting to feel like hard work.
Yeah, I know.
  And her foot...
  Is totally better.
I think she's well enough to go home and look after Harley, but...
Since she's started hanging out with us in the treehouse
she doesn't want to leave.
  That's right. I can't keep up with her.
  She ate my pie!
  Not your...?
  Yes, the pie I save for emergencies.
Right! Heads together, lads.
  I've got a plan!
I don't know why you've brought me back home.
I was really happy in the treehouse.
This way, folks.
Ta da!
Oh, wow!
You built a sty for Harley.
Brilliant!
Careful. Mind your foot.
Oh... Oh...
Er...actually, I think it might be getting better.
  Thanks, Dennis.
  That's OK, Gran.
Do you think you're going to be able to cope all right?
Harley's a bit of a handful.
Oh, don't worry, I'll be able to handle him
now he's got his own place to live in.
So, where is this pig anyway?
Ah! Oh!
Get... Get... I had to ask!
Leave him, pig.
Leave me... Get off me, you stupid pig.
Hey, wait a minute. I recognise that sty.
Didn't it used to be MY shed?
Used to be, Dad.
Used to be.
THEY LAUGH Denis!
Oof! I'm glad we've got the treehouse to ourselves again.
  Wah! What's the...?
