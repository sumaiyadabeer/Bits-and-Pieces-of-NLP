former prime minister, Tony Blair, I thank the Prime Minister for
those generous words about Private Bill because his his battalion is
based in Colchester. Does the Prime Minister share my concern that some
local authorities and some health trusts are using the perceived cuts
as an excuse to... To make cuts thus undermining voluntary
organisations and charities with the Big society concept? Look, I
share the honourable gentleman's concern and he is right to air it
in the case of the Department of Health, of course, there aren't
cuts in the Department of Health budget. The health Budget is going
up and it is very important that the Department of Health as I know
my right honourable friend is doing so actually does everything he can
he can to protect the important voluntary organisations working in
that department. In terms of the Local Government, yes, there are
reductions in spending as there would be whoever was standing at
this dispatch box. But I would urge local authorities to look first at
their own costs. It is only when they can show they are they are
sharing Chief Executives and cutting out their own bure October
bure own bureaucracies elsewhere. Can I join the Prime Minister in
honouring the memory of Private Martin Bell. He showed enormous
bravery and dedication as the Prime Minister said and we send
condolences to his family and friends. Last weekend I saw for
myself the bravery and commitment of our our troops in Afghanistan. I
think like everyone who visits, I came away with a sense of
admiration and humility and I pay tribute to everyone who is based in
unfolding situation in Egypt? Can I ask him to update the House on the
important issue of the security of British nationals. Can he inform us
of the arrangements being made for those who want to return to the UK?
First of all, can I thank the right honourable gentleman for his
generous tribute to our troops and for his visit to Afghanistan. I
praise him for what he said. In terms of Egypt, of course, he is
right the first concern should be for our own UK nationals and for
the situation that they are in. Of course, there are around 30,000 UK
nationals in the Red Sea area which remains calm and stable and we have
not changed travel advice to that part of Egypt. In terms of the rest
of Egypt, there are 3,000 UK citizens in Cairo and 300 in
Alexandria. In terms of making sure those that want to return can and
we've urged many to do so, there are still very good commercial
flights and we have added a flight commissioned by the British
Government in the last 48 hours 1,000 UK citizens have returned.
The UK Government has acted swiftly. We had a rapid deployment of 25
special consular staff to Cairo. The military logistics team of
eight was sent out immediately and we were the first country to set up
a team at the Cairo Airport which many countries have gone on to
imitate. There needs to be no complacency, but or ambassador and
his team have done an excellent job and we should praise them.
I am grateful to him for that reply. Let me ask him about the wider
issues on Egypt. I think Mr Speaker, everyone has been moved by the
images we have seen on our screens in the last few days of hundreds of
thousands of people against overwhelming odds demanding a more
democratic future. Following president Mubarak's statement last
night, can I ask the Prime Minister whether he agrees with President
Obama that the stable and orderly transition to democracy must be
meaningful, peaceful and begin now? We take that view. The transition
needs to be rapid and credible and it needs to start now. I think as
the honourable gentleman says we should be clear. With stand with
those in this country who want freedom and democracy and rights
the world over. That should always be our view. You can't watch the
scenes in Cairo without finding it moving about people wanting to have
those aspirations in Egypt as we have them in our country. The
Government takes a very strong view that political reform is what is
required, not repression and we have made that clear in all the
calls I've made to President Mubarak and yesterday the Egyptian
Prime Minister. Have they done enough? President Mubarak says he
is going and we respect that, but what matters is not the orderly
transition, it is you are general and starts now. And the more they
can do with a timetable to convince people it is true, the more people
can settle down to a democratic future.
Isn't it also clear that far from indicating support for extremism,
the people on the streets of Egypt are actually demanding some basic
things jobs, freedom of speech, and the right to choose by whom they
are governed. Now we have a clear interest in stability in our
countries in the region, but isn't it now apparent that the best route
to stability in Egypt is precisely through democracy? I agree with
that. I think that they should take the view that the long term
interests of Britain are from a stable, Middle East and a stable
Arab world and we won't get that stability unless they make moves
towards greater democracy. Where we need to be clear when we talk about
greater democracy, we don't mean the the act of holding an election.
I want to see a partnership for open societies where we encourage
stronger civil society, stronger rights, stronger rule of law, a
proper place for the army in society, proper independent
judiciary. It is these things that can give us a stronger, more stable,
more democratic future that will be in our interests and theirs as well.
I'm sure there is a consensus across the House on the points he
makes. I know he will keep the House updated on the situation in
Egypt. I want to turn to Afghanistan, Mr Speaker. Can I say
to the Prime Minister that we support the mission and we support
the timetable he has set for the end of combat operations by British
troops. Now during my visit, the commanders on the ground told me we
are bringing real pressure to bear on the insurgency, can he provide
the House with his latest assessment of the of the overall
progress of our mission in the light of the timetable that has
been set? I'm grateful for that. We are
making progress in Helmand, but it is important not to just focus on
Helmand. We have to look at rest of Afghanistan. Helmand itself,
Government north has gone from six provinces in Helmand to twelve.
That's where the Afghan Government has control that's out of fourteen.
The increase in the Afghan National Army is on targeted for 171,000
soldiers by the end of this year and 134,000 police. The key tho is
the better balance of forces we have. There has been a surge in the
number of troops and we have got a better balance between the US and
the UK forces so we are more thickly concentrated in fewer areas
and better able able to do the job. We have set this clear clear
timetable saying we don't want UK forces could be in combat by 2014.
We will have to work hard on training up the Afghan National
Army. We have to integrate those involved in insurgency and we have
to make sure the Government of Afghanistan improves in the way too
I know he believes is important. It is that point about the
political track that I want to pursue with the Prime Minister.
Does he agree with me that setting a timetable makes it more important
that we have a lasting political settlement and one that endures
beyond the departure of British troops. A political settlement must
reach out to those elements of the insurgency who are prepared to
break all links with Al Qaeda, renounce violence and respect the
Afghan stit tuition.    constitution.
Those are the key conditions. Setting a timetable encourages
people in Afghanistan themselves to recognise that they have to take
the steps necessary to take control of their country again. So yes, we
need this political track. We need to work much harder at it. The keys
are separating the Taliban from Al  Qaeda, rejecting violence and
accepting the basic tenants of the Afghan con constitution. Those are
the keys so we can bring our brave soldiers home at the end of this
conflict. I sense that people aren't use to
this kind of PMQs! But let me finally emphasise to him
the urgency of supporting the Afghan Government in establishing
that political settlement. Let me say that I will support him in all
the efforts he makes with the United Nations, the United States
and all our NATO partners on this. Can he tell me then what concrete
steps he believes we can take between now and the Bonn Conference
to make this happen? First of all, I'm sure he is right
from all the noises people would prefer a bun fight! Sometimes it is
sensible to have a serious conversation about the issues we
face. When you visit our troops in Afghanistan, they want us to
discuss what they are doing, to discuss it sensibly and try and get
it right. In terms of encouraging the political track, I think it is
very important that we engage not just with the Afghan Government,
but also with the Pakistan Government. We are not going to
create a stable Afghanistan and that should be our aim. An
Afghanistan that is stable and can take our troops home without it
becoming a hotbed of terrorism. We wob be able to    won't be able to
do that unless we engage with the Pakistanis. Having a political
track those who who have been opposed to us, recognise there is a
peaceful path they can follow, but they have to give up violence and
have to renounce Al Qaeda before that can happen.
. East Anglia celebrated in October the announcement that the
Government put aside the funding required to complete the dualling
of the A11 and the support of the Prime Minister then was very much
welcomed. Will he now join with me and our coalition colleagues across
the region in pressing for an early start date for this scheme so the
economic benefits can be delivered as soon as possible? I think all of
us who visited the Norwich by  election remember how important the
A11 is to people in Norwich. We have guaranteed the funding in the
Spending Review. We're spending over £30 million on transport
infrastructure over the next four years. Work on the A1 111 is an
important    A11 a an important project and the construction work
will start in the current spending period.
Dylan Scollan is an six year old autistic boy in my constituency. At
six year old he has had his speech and language support taken away
because he is too old. What does the Prime Minister think I should
say to his mother, Rachel who is outraged for the way this support
has been taken away? I am sure like anyone he will work as hard to help
that family get the therapies they need. That means going to the
county council and arguing the case which many of us had to do not only
with constituents, but also with our own children as well. You have
to make the fight. We are going to be producing a paper on special
educational needs which will reform the way these things are done and
make it less confrontational. I know as a parent how stuff it is to
sometimes get what your family needs.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the Prime Minister and the
ministers who have been so helpful over the last 24 hours with regard
to the to the Pfizer closure in my constituency. I want assurance that
the Government will do everything it can to secure the site, secure
the high skilled employees and the local economy? The honourable lady
is right to speak out about this. It is depressing news. It is bad
news. My office has been in contact with them. I spoke to them this
morning. There is no doubt that the decision is being taken not not
because of some UK based issue, but because the company has decided
exit some areas. The company is keeping the options open in term of
what should happen to the site, including getting partner
organisations to continue work there and to get other companies to
come in. The fact is, it is a state of the art site and it has
brilliant employees doing great work there and the Government will
do everything it can, co ordinated by David Willetts and the head of
life life sciences to make sure we make the best of what is a
depressing bit of news. Can the Prime Minister confirm a
report in today's Financial Times that the deptry Prime Minister has
   Deputy Prime Minister has written to him suggesting that
councils should be given the power to raise their own fuel duty and
does he agree. The Deputy Prime Minister write to
each other and speak to each other on a frequent basis! What we both
want to see is we want to see well resourced local councils that have
greater powers, greater devolution and less top down bureaucracy than
we had under the party opposite. On Friday, this Friday, hundreds of
Mid Bedfordshire residents, and myself will provide a warm welcome
for the visiting members of the IPC who will be come to go make a
decision as to whether or not they grant planning permission to the
incinerator which they want to put in my constituency.
Will the Prime Minister give his assurance that the draft national
policy statements which will guide the IPCC in their decision will be
amended in order that the weight is given to the wishes of local
people? If they don't want it, it I thank the honourable lady for her
question. As the government we have committed to abolish the IPC
because we think it is a bureaucratic top down method and we
think there are ministerial decisions which can be taken into
account. Does the Prime Minister share my
dismay that despite being 86 % publicly owned, the RBS bank is
still dishing out huge bonuses? May I suggest to him one course of
action, it may be helpful. Would he agree with me that these bankers
that defy government and continue to make these grotesque bonuses
should never be considered for any honours in the future?
First of all, can I congratulate the right honourable gentleman for
his new position... That has probably ended his career, I am
sorry for that. We are in discussions with RBS about this
issue. We are bound by a contract that was signed by the previous
government but I am absolutely clear that what we want to see from
the banks is a lower bonus pool, we want to see more lending and we
want them to be contributing more tax to the Exchequer. I'm quite
convinced we will see all of those things from the discussions we are
having. Daniel Kawczynski. Thank you, Mr Speaker. The local NHS
Trust in Shropshire a crackly proposing major Configuration
changes to services including maternity and paediatrics
throughout Shropshire. These are causing significant concerns to
local doctors and patient groups. Can ask the Prime Minister for an
assurance that these concerns will be taken on board and acted on
before any changes are made. Answer ice    and I can say that my eight
right honourable friend shares my views. There are much stronger
arrangements for making sure local people are listened to when these
discussions are taking place. No changes will be allowed unless they
focus on improving patient outcomes, unless they consider patient choice,
unless they have the support of the GP commissioners. In the future
health system, it will be the decisions of the GPs and the people
that drive the provisions of the health service, not top down
decisions made by ministers in Whitehall. Pay freezes, pension
cuts, tens of thousands of public workers sacked, the disabled and
the poor hit... How can the Prime Minister justified the build up of
50 billion electron    election workers at the expense? Are all of
the decisions we have had to make about pay, pensions and welfare,
they all the consequence of the government he has spent 30 years
supporting. This week I went to a gathering of
the sulks students. In Keighley, too many children start school and
do not speak English. Does the Prime Minister agree with me that
there is a responsibility and an obligation on parents to make sure
they    their children speak English? I completely agree and in
too many cases this is not happening. The last government did
make some progress in making sure people learned English when they
come to this country and I think we need to go further. If we look at
people who are brought over as husbands and wives, particularly
from the Indian sub continent, we will be putting in tougher rules to
make sure they do learn English so that when they come they can be
more integrated into our country. There are 51 disabled workers in
the Remploy factory in Aberdare in my constituency. They have all been
offered voluntary redundancy. They take great pride in the products
they make. Two years ago the Deputy Prime Minister pledged his support
to the Remploy workers. understanding is we inherited a
plan that was phasing out support for the Remploy workers. But as
what we inherited. I will get back to the lady of that is not correct.
We must do everything we can to support and help people who are
disabled into work and that is exactly what the new benefit system
and work programme will be all out    all about.
Would my Right Honourable friend described the biggest structural
deficit in the G7 as a golden economic inheritance? I certainly
would not. My right honourable friend makes an extremely good. But
at the weekend the Shadow Chancellor stated baldly there was
no structural deficit when Labour left office. He is nodding out.
Even though the Institute for Fiscal Studies could not be clearer
that we have one of the biggest structural deficits of anywhere in
the advanced world. If you start in opposition in a position of
complete deficit denial, you will never be taken seriously again.
Mr Speaker, with youth unemployment at the highest level since records
began, will the Prime Minister reconsider the decision to scrap
the future jobs fund? First well, can I say how good it is to see the
honourable gentleman back and well and in his place. What I would say
about youth unemployment is, this is a problem that got worse during
the boom years under the last government and then got even worse
during the recession and is still a big problem today. I don't believe
the future jobs funds the answer because it was five times more
expensive than other schemes and in some places like Birmingham, only
3% of the jobs were in the private sector. It was not a good scheme.
It will be replaced by better schemes. Everyone in this house
needs to work together on how we tackle youth and employment, a
skirt which has got worse over the last 13 years.    a scourge.
Will the Prime Minister commit to making continued support of the
Commons fisheries policy... He the current regime of discarding fish
that are perfectly healthy is not acceptable and needs to change. Now
we are in government we have an opportunity to work to that end.
Prime Minister, before the election, you came to the province and you
entered into a contract of    with the people of Northern Ireland and
a promise to make change to our economy. He told the people to read
the contract, stick on your fridge, use it to hold us to account. 10
months later we have lost £4 billion from our budget with rising
unemployment. Can you update this house on any progress to reduce
Northern Ireland's level of corporation tax bear in mind we are
in competition with the Irish Republic that this country has
bailed out isn't it. I remember the visit and one thing we said was we
would sort out the Presbyterian mutual society and I'm proud to say
we have done that and delivered that pledge in Northern Ireland.
Everyone in Northern Ireland knows we have got to balance the economy.
My right honourable friend is looking at all the potential for
things like enterprise zones, different tax rates to try to bring
that about. That is what we are committed to. I was told that
apprenticeships were at a school's number one priority with strong
local schemes operating in the area. Will the Prime Minister back the
skills for work campaign to encourage more youngsters in the
north east to take up the apprenticeships which rather?
honourable friend is absolutely right to raise this. We have made
some difficult decisions in the spending round but what we have
done is increase the funding for apprenticeships so that we will be
funding 75,000 more project than what was planned under the party
opposite. We think this is vital for helping young people, not just
into work for the short term but to make sure they can have good and
worthwhile careers in hour rebalance to economy.
There is a brilliant little company in my constituency that makes
parachutes for the UK and internationally. However, they are
in danger of being stuffed in a tender competition which is going
on that will cost 50 jobs that will go to a French company. They are
cheaper, they are better and there is an opportunity for the Prime
Minister to intervene and allow the company at their own cost to put
this into trial for the UK MoD. It will lead to exports as well.
honourable gentleman makes a passionate plea for a business in
his constituency and he is right to do that. I'm sure the Ministry of
Defence will hear what he says. I want every opportunity for British
defence manufacturers to compete and succeed and we are doing
everything we can to help them. We have been talking about
apprenticeships, we are delivering the lowest rate of corporation tax
in the G7 and all of these things will help us to take on and beat
our competitors. Following the report in December by
the Right Honourable Member for Birkenhead discussing how to
prevent poor children from becoming poor adults, what action as does
the Prime Minister intend to take to address the central
prop    public policy? honourable gentleman is right. It
is good that the Member for Birkenhead has produced this report.
It is an excellent report about how to help children out of poverty.
The steps we are taking is funding two year olds in nursery education,
a pledge never made all delivered by the party opposite. The second
thing is a pupil premium for children on free school meals so
the money follows them into school. They shake their heads. They had 13
years to do it. They never did. There were 4,000 stillbirths in the
United Kingdom last year. The pain for those families is utterly
unimaginable. Will the Prime Minister give a guarantee there
will be no cut in the funding to the causes of still births? What I
can tell him is there is no cut in the National Health Service. We are
putting 10.6 billion extra into the NHS during this Parliament. That is
against the advice of many including his own front bench. I
will get back to him on the specific research he speaks about
but I know and every member will have met constituents who have had
this situation and how heartbreaking it can be and when we
can get to understand what the cause of stillbirth is, we should
of course be doing that. The Toklund and school and my
constituency last month celebrated becoming an academy and governors
are delighted with the freedoms becoming an academy has given them.
Could the Prime Minister give words of advice to other schools and
Thurrock who are taking that step? I would encourage all schools were
looking at academy status because of the extra freedom it gives you,
the extra responsibility it gives you and the evidence is now clear
that Academy schools, particularly those in less well off areas have
transformed the results in those places and what we have managed to
do as a coalition government, in the last nine months, we have
created as many Academy Schools as the last government did in the last
seven years so we are making good progress but we should keep up the
pressure. A recent poll found 47 % of the
British government feel big government have lost control of the
economy. Given this government has axed the future jobs fund, has
trebled tuition fees and scrapped EMAs, the country people up and
down the country are asking is has this Prime Minister got a plan for
the young people? There is only one side in this house that has got a
plan at all. The party opposite has got absolutely no plan apart from
to deny the deficit, to say there was not a problem and to pretend
that somehow, they handed on a golden inheritance when a fact, we
had the biggest budget deficit in advanced countries and a pile of
debt to deal with. Given the commitment of the
coalition government to reinvigorate occupational pensions,
National Association of Pension funds of its work place retirement
income Commission which is designed to produce proposals to improve the
adequacy of pensions so that people can live with dignity and enough
money in retirement? My honourable friend makes a good point which is
we want to see strong, private sector provision. I think the
history over the last 13 years has been depressing when so much money
running the Labour Party. We want to see a stronger private pension
provision so that people can have independence and dignity in their
old age. 200 years ago, the privileged
people in this country managed to steal the English common land from
the English, people. Why his government returning to that kind
I have to say, this government is taking a completely different
approach to the last government. The last government sold off
Forestry with no guarantees of access, no guarantees that it was
free, no guarantees about habitat. Of course, I am listening to all of
the arguments that are being put in this case but I would say this, is
it the case that their organisations, like the Woodland
Trust, like the National Trust that can do a better job than the
Forestry Commission? I believe there are. Is there a problem with
the Forestry Commission that... Order. I apologise for disrupting
the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister must not be shouted at.
The question was heard and the answer must be had. The Prime
Minister. What I'm say to the honourable gentleman, is there a
problem when you have the Forestry Commission which is responsible for
regulating forestry but is also a massive owner of forestry? We don't
