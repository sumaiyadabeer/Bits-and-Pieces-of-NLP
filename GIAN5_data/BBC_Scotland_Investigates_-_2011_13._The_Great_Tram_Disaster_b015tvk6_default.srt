The people of Edinburgh have been waiting a long time for their trams
to arrive. A very long time. Scotland's taxpayers are also
waiting to discover where all their money's gone. Everyone's waiting to
hear the inside story of the great tram disaster.
In my investigation, the Scottish Government will reveal they believe
they were hoodwinked. I certainly feel fundamentally misled.
An investigation which reveals the failure of the people in charge.
We were not people who had previously had experience of major
projects like this. And an investigation in which the
company at the centre of the crisis speaks out for the first time.
is something very extraordinary, what we're experiencing.
This is the inside story of Search hard enough and you can find
one of Edinburgh's Trams. Hidden away on an industrial estate just
outside the city. The tram company didn't want us to film it. But we
has ever been delivered. By now, it should be speeding through the
capital's streets. But it's not going anywhere any time soon. As I
look at this solitary tram, it's a reminder of just how long I've been
covering this story. The tram project has brought chaos
and controversy to the streets of the capital. It is amid high 
profile contractual disputes and concerns about soaring costs.
This tram is still being tested. But others like it begin arriving
in Edinburgh within the next two weeks. For now, this is literally
the end of the line. Yes, I think even the most seasoned
observers of what we can safely call now the Edinburgh tram fiasco
will be scratching their heads in disbelief this evening.
The Edinburgh Trams still aren't here. And they're half a billion
pounds over budget. Why? This is the tram depot near Edinburgh
Airport. It was designed to lie at the heart of the capital's tram
network. No one's talking about a network these days. As the costs
have gone up, the length of the tram line has gone down. The
project's come close to collapse, taking Edinburgh's reputation and
hundreds of millions of pounds of your money with it. But time and
again, we were told, "Don't worry, everything's fine." Why on earth
did Edinburgh decide to go for trams in the first place?
Donald Anderson was one of the councillors who came up with the
plan. What people forget about trams is that the proposals connect
all the parts of Edinburgh that are important for the city's economy.
From the airport, Edinburgh Park, the exchange financial district.
And the plan was, of course, to go to Leith and help the regeneration
of Leith. And these are critical areas for Edinburgh as a city
economy. And it was that difference that we wanted to make, because a
tram can carry up to twice as many people per hour as a bus can. And
that meant people could move more quickly and it would benefit the
city and the city's economy. first thing the council had to do
was raise the money for the tram network. Councillors decided
charging motorists to drive into the city would be one way to help
find the money needed to pay for the trams. So they asked the people
of Edinburgh to back their plan for a congestion charge in a referendum.
Yes, support for the council's preferred strategy... 45,965.
No, do not support the council's preferred strategy... 133,678.
No congestion charge meant less no cash.    less cash. Councillors
turned to Scottish Ministers. Was that, looking back, the moment
when you should have said... "The public have voted against
congestion charging, we won't have the funds we need to deliver this
project?" There was the resource there to implement it. And it was
increasingly important that we did something to tackle the traffic
congestion that we had in Edinburgh. And the need to continue to invest
in the city and the city economy. So there wasn't any time that we
doubted that that is was the right thing to do. And there was popular
support for it. Every household survey that we carried out as a
council. Every survey that was carried out by everybody else
pretty much said that the trams were a popular thing to do and
people were behind it. So, the city council lost the referendum and the
chance to raise the cash it needed. But it decided to push ahead with
the trams. The council had set up its own transport company, TIE. Its
job was to manage the project. Richard Kerley's spent years
studying why councils create companies like TIE. It can enable
the council to bring in external expertise, external contributors,
usually at board level. This gives a different insight into how that
service or that activity might be run. I think that was, in principal,
a perfectly good and reasonable idea that other councils have done.
With a team of experts in place at TIE, and the promise of money from
Scottish Ministers, Edinburgh was heading back to the future. Trams
last ran on the capital's streets back in 1956. They're still
remembered fondly. These days, across Europe, trams are seen as a
solution to the 21st century problems of pollution and
congestion. Edinburgh didn't want to be left behind by its
continental rivals. The challenge was to turn these flashy computer
graphics into reality. If Dublin Everybody now knows it all went
horribly wrong. It's easy to label the trams a disaster. But given the
complexity and detail of this story, it's harder to understand why that
disaster happened. Edinburgh was promised a tram network. Instead,
it will get one line running from Edinburgh Airport to the city
centre. As costs have gone up, the length of the line has gone down.
In 2003, the public was told the entire network would cost �375
million. By 2007, the figure for one line from the airport all the
way to the waterfront had risen to Remember, without the congestion
charge, most of that cash would have to come from the Scottish
Government. TIE got the money, even though the SNP, who were now in
power, didn't want to pay for the trams. Why were they the only party
at Holyrood who were against them? We didn't think that the Edinburgh
Tram project represented the best use of �500 million worth of public
money. At a time when there is a broad range of capital projects
that we think could have made more of an impact. The other reason, I
think, is that we generally felt that the public transport
connections in Edinburgh were of a pretty high quality. We had hardly
become a government before the opposition were harrying us already
to get on with the trams and to resolve this issue. And, at that
stage, the government had just been formed. We were finding our feet,
we were a minority administration. And one of the judgements I made in
2007 was that I thought that, if we... If we didn't accept the
opposition will, I suspected that they would being down the
government. Work started in earnest in 2007. The first job was to dig
up the roads and move the utilities. The gas pipes, the electricity
cables and the phone lines which lay beneath the route. The streets
would then be ready for the track to be laid. The utility works were
meant to be completed by 2008. Three years later, that still
The tram line is being built by a consortium led by the German
company Bilfinger Berger. Time to leave Edinburgh to travel to
Germany and hear the company's side of the story. This is Wiesbaden,
where its civil engineering arm is based. Because of the contract with
the tram company TIE, Bilfinger Berger's never before been allowed
to speak to the media. One of the biggest frustrations
about this story has been the confidentiality clause which has
prevented Bilfinger Berger giving us its side of the story. Until now.
The biggest problem were the utilities. What we experienced was
the big surprise. That even those areas which were supposed to be
cleared and free of utilities were not. And, I mean, that was the
biggest surprise. And I think everybody, even the public,
expected and was informed that all the utility works would be finished.
I think, by end of 2008, at that time. And nobody expected that they
would run still into 2011. So, to be clear, the utilities weren't
moved before you began work, as TIE had promised? That's right, that's
right. The project was facing other risks.
TIE's demands for changes in the design also led to increased costs.
But who should foot the bill? Time and time again, workers had to down
tools while TIE and Bilfinger Berger argued over who was
responsible for those cost increases. The vast majority of the
risk was still within the responsibility of TIE, our client.
And especially with those risks which materialised to an extent
nobody expected at the beginning, to be fair. The design changes and
utility problems. They were clearly within the responsibility of TIE.
So in realty, from the outset, the risk lay with TIE? With the Public
Purse? Yes. If more of the risk lay with the consortium, what would
that have meant for the contract? How much would you have charged to
build the tram system? We wouldn't have been able to take all the
risks. Because, in a normal construction contract, you don't
take the risk for unforeseeable things. So many of the things were,
from the perspective of the year 2007 2008, unforeseeable. We would
have never taken unforeseeable risks. Those that would be
foreseeable would have substantially increased the price
at this stage. So was TIE, the company set up to
manage the project, hampered by its own contract? The contract itself
was, or appears, in a number of ways, to have favoured the main
contractors. This shouldn't surprise anybody. If you have a big
contractor, who is, whether individually or in a consortium,
used to doing major civil engineering projects. They are used
to doing that. They have people who write contracts all the time. They
give them the edge in every dispute over the contract. And there will
always be disputes. Everyone we've spoken to during
this investigation agrees the contract failed to provide the
clarity needed to prevent dozens of disputes arising between TIE and
the consortium building the line. Sources close to the project have
told us there's another, more human, reason for the problems. TIE's boss,
Willie Gallagher, who negotiated the contract, had already departed.
He was replaced by chairman, David Mackay, and chief executive Richard
Jeffrey. All three declined to be interviewed for this programme.
I've been told the relationship between TIE and the Bilfinger
Berger led consortium became so poisonous that key figures couldn't
even bear to be in the same room. So what on earth was going wrong?
The difficulty was mainly in the fact that TIE read the contract
completely different than we were doing. And you cannot ask me why
they did it. I still don't know. Maybe they were badly advised.
Maybe they just tried to pressure us in a certain position. But this
was frustrating. And if you have a completely different reading of the
risk assessment in the contract, you cannot come together. And that
was a frustrating situation. We've discovered that, in desperation,
the consortium wrote to senior figures at Edinburgh City Council.
They were warning that TIE's handling of the project was leading
to lengthy delays and huge We've obtained a copy of the letter
they sent. It lays bare the extent of the crisis, and warns the
contractual dispute had already added more than �100 million to the
cost of the project. The consortium warns of smear tactics and
"misleading" media briefings. The aim here was to warn that TIE's
handling of the tram project was proving disastrous. But we've
learned the Council declined to intervene. It made clear it was up
to TIE and the consortium to find a solution. Why couldn't both sides
simply agree a fair price for the extra work? Was it TIE, or was it
the Bilfinger Berger consortium which refused to compromise? Gordon
MacKenzie was one of four Edinburgh councillors on the board of TIE.
There is a perception that TIE became too focused on disputing the
matter, rather than getting a commercial settlement. Well, it was
never ruled out. It was simply that, throughout the period 2009 2010, we
believed the view that we were getting from senior managers was
that what the contractor was suggesting in terms of commercial
settlement was too rich. They were asking for too much, and they
weren't giving enough in terms of guarantees.
So, on a case by case basis, the disagreements between TIE and the
consortium were referred to expert independent adjudicators. This
painstaking and expensive process kept work on key sections of the
tramline at a standstill. So what did the adjudicators decide? At the
time, the City Council and TIE claimed the process was going well.
Overall, as was reported in the council report last month, they
have come down in favour of, or they have reduced the amounts that
Bilfinger have been claiming by about 50% compared to what they
went into before the adjudication process started, or the dispute
process started. So, you know, I feel that that shows there has
certainly been some success for TIE through that process.
That version of events was repeatedly challenged by the media.
But the adjudications themselves remained secret. We've now obtained
copies of those adjudications. And they confirm TIE and the council
were putting a positive spin on bad news. Bilfinger Berger, gagged by
the contract, couldn't speak out. The adjudications show that TIE was,
in fact, losing   again, and again, and again.
Within that process, you know, we were successful in reducing the
claims the contractor was making by over 50%. Now, had we not done that,
there's no guarantee we would have achieved that sort of result. And
indeed, in some of the claims we were successful, but in far too
many of them, and some very important ones, we were not.
As the crisis deepened, TIE executives continued to defend
their handling of the dispute. But as 2010 drew to a close, and with
the project now massively over budget, the Scottish Government
finally lost patience. I thought, "This is just going
nowhere." I ordered the City Council to go to mediation. Because
I'd had all the explanation about, you know "We've got this
contractual strength, we're pursuing all the challenges, we're
challenging the contractor, we're very confident we can pull it.
We've got legal advice that says we're going to do it." And it was
rubbish. The next act in the drama was to be
played out here, at the luxurious Marr Hall Hotel near Glasgow. An
independent mediator was flown in from the United States to lead days
of negotiations, all designed to tackle problems which could be
traced back to the original tram contract. People involved in those
negiotiations have told me that, by now, TIE was seen as part of the
problem, not part of the solution. And its days   well, they were very
definitely numbered. These negotiations began just weeks after
Sue Bruce took over as Chief Executive of Edinburgh Council. Her
arrival appears to have changed everything. I hesitate to ask the
question   had the situation become too male?
Well, I think it is a fact of the matter that it was largely male. I
don't know whether that's a factor or not. I think, you know   people
had got into entrenched positions, and we needed to get a lever to get
us all out of those entrenched positions. And the mediation was
that lever, and I was delighted to be playing a part in it.
But look at the track that's already been laid. There's still a
long way to go. This summer, the Scottish Government finally stepped
in, after the cost of the trams escalated to �770 million, and
councillors bickered over where the line should end. We now know the
final bill, interest included, will come to more than �1 billion. So,
was TIE a mistake from the very start?
I thought it was unnecessarily complex, and I think that, in
running with arm's length companies, public bodies always need to be
crystal clear about the relationship   how the relationship
is managed, how the accountabilities are expressed, and
how the difficulties, or any difficulties that arise, are dealt
with. And I think, you know, those are the types of difficulties that
were encountered during the life of TIE.
TIE's expensive offices now stand largely empty, beside a still 
unfinished section of the tram line. Throughout its existence, serious
questions were continually being asked about what was going wrong
inside TIE. Former MSP Shirley Anne Somerville was a persistent critic.
Her tough approach led to her being known at TIE as "SAS". But even she
found it hard to get to the truth. Well, there's a very
easy excuse that's often used in projects like that, like this, and
that's "commercial confidentiality". And that's what kept coming back to
me. That's why we had to use Freedom of Information, even as an
elected politician. That's why things had to go to appeal to the
Information Commissioner, to finally get information. By which
time it was six months out of date, and the story had already moved on.
So it was impossible, virtually impossible, to try and get any
clear answers on this project. And I think, within TIE, you had an
organisation that wanted to reach certain milestones within that
project, so that we got to a point where it was too late to call the
project off. The Board of TIE included four
Edinburgh Councillors. So why didn't they see what was going
wrong? I think that putting councillors on
the board of TIE didn't add anything in terms of the technical
expertise that a project like this requires. I mean, I have a social
work background. Others have electronics and banking management,
that sort of thing. We were not people who had previously had
experience of major projects like this. We didn't have legal
expertise, for example. I don't think there was anybody on the
board with that sort of expertise. So, as a board, did we have the
right skill mix to properly scrutinise? I look back   and I'm
sure the inquiry will look at this   and my feeling is that we
probably didn't have the right skill mix. Not to say that any
individual was lacking in a particular way. But, you know, I
think we were put together for political purposes as much as
anything else. That's an astonishing admission. It
suggests a complete failure on the part of Edinburgh's political
leaders to hold TIE to account. Given the chaos unfolding, why
wasn't the Scottish Government stepping in?
Now, on the question of why didn't I move in at different stages...I
contemplated it. I came very close to doing it at different stages.
But what I felt at different stages when I was, you know, pursuing that
line of inquiry, examining what was going onI was on the receiving end
of information passed to me by the City Council. In good faith, I
would have to say principally from TIE. And I think it was absolute
rubbish. Total rubbish. And I certainly feel fundamentally misled
by TIE as an organisation. I think they fundamentally misled the City
Council, and as a consequence created enormous difficulties for
the project. And the fact that TIE has essentially now faced its day
of reckoning is an outcome which I think was too long in the coming.
That's a serious allegation. Why do you think TIE misled you?
I think they got themselves into a ditch, and they just kept on
digging. And as they kept on digging, it just got worse, and
worse, and worse. And what that was about was about TIE being
fundamentally unable to take forward a constructive relationship
with the contractors on this project. Let me give you a
comparison. Bilfinger Berger were the principal contractors on the
M80 upgrade that the Government undertook. Did we have a problem
with Bilfinger Berger? Not a bit of it. Perfectly decent company to
work with. We have probably up to 200 bigger
projects around the world running. And from time to time you get into
a dispute with a client. This happens. But the vast, vast
majority of our clients are extremely happy with our
performance. Even our consortium partners cannot recognise a similar
experience in the recent past. This is something very extraordinary,
what we experienced here. This has been an incredibly complex
dispute. The reason for that complexity? The contract. It never
offered the clarity or the certainty which everyone involved
in the project needed right from the very start. This is the revised
contract. We're told it offers greater clarity, and that it's more
concise, too. But take a look. It still runs to thousands of pages.
I think we have to continue to work hard to make sure that we manage
the contract tightly   that we keep the dialogue open and constructive
with the contractors. We are still in a contractual environment where
they are commercially driven, and we are driven by the principles of
public service. And we have to bring those two together. We
understand each other now, and we do have an open discussion about
that context. Much uncertainty remains
about the future of Edinburgh's trams. And the failures of the past
five years have left some in no mood to forgive.
I think everybody, not just within Edinburgh, but within Scotland,
should be angry about this project. Because we can deliver transport
projects on time and on budget, within Transport Scotland and
within the Government. We've shown that. So this isn't an issue about
Scotland not being able to deliver projects. This is a project which
went wrong from the start, which we knew the business case that didn't
stack up on. And I think you had politicians in other parties who
fell for the gloss, fell for the spin of wanting a tram project, but
didn't actually realise that you need to read the fine print about
how much it's going to cost. It's worth remembering that many
people have done rather well out of all of this. The contractors are
being paid a lot of money. Consultants and lawyers have all
been paid handsomely, with big bonuses up for grabs. But what
about the people who are actually I remember them the first time
round. And it's an absolute disgrace, the money that's been
wasted. Good idea or bad idea?
Bad idea. Why?
The money for a start. It's costing us an absolute fortune.
Why do you think they're a waste of money?
Because you dinnae need them. There's a good bus service.
Personally, I prefer the bus service. The trams are a bit of a
waste of money. GREEN Dinnae dae me any good,
anyway. It only goes from the airport to Princes Street.
You'll no be able tae use your bus pass on it, either!
Why is it costing so much? Well, I think it's probably been
poorly managed. And, eh, that's my bus!
Great bus service we've got. I mean, it's been awarded before, eh? So.
Anyway, my bus is coming so I'd better actually go.
Do you think you'll take the tram rather than the bus?
I'll always take the bus every time out of principle.
So, you're going to boycott the trams?
Mm hmm. Absolutely. Edinburgh was promised a tram
network. The First Minister's promised Scotland a public inquiry
into what went wrong. But, like the trams, it won't be arriving anytime
I think we've got to let the project get on, and get some more
progress under its belt, and get much nearer to completion, before
we have the inquiry. I think an inquiry now would be distracting to
those who are trying to get the project moving and get some action
Until the Trams finally arrive, there is one sure fire way of
beating Edinburgh's congestion. Get It also works out about �1 billion
cheaper. The people of Edinburgh, and Scotland's taxpayers, have been
