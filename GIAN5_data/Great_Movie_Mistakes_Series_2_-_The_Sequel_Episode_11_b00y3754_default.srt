Every film pays people to meticulously work through the finer details
and ensure that not even minute errors end up on the big screen.
However, our team of super nerds have proven to be even more meticulous than them,
So...1 0 to the nerds, then, hmm?
so imagine how the passengers in Final Destination must feel.
They started in a spacious 747, with its trademark double decker nose
and two engines on each side,
but, on take off, it's clearly a much smaller two engined plane.
There they go. Here we stay.
'70s set thriller Zodiac,
which features a shot of the then state of the art computer game Pong.
  The score's 15 9.
  My own kids would kill me for one of those.
Unfortunately, the game performs a back and forth of its own,
because now it's 14 9, and back to 15 9.
Careful, Robert Downey Jr, we almost caught a glimpse of YOUR ping pongs.
  You don't like it, you can move back with your mum.
  I can't, actually...
Here's a classic nerdy Hollywood nerd playing nerdy Second Life in Hot Tub Time Machine.
But surely a nerd of this calibre would have spotted that
he's not actually playing the game, he's watching a video.
Because those are the controls for Quicktime Media Player.
Or am I a nerd for spotting that?
Why do you waste your time with that Second Life bull...
Here's lovable moron Forrest Gump
receiving a letter confirming his shares in Apple Incorporated.
He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.
Well, here's a catchphrase for you, Forrest.
Stupid is having a letter from Apple Incorporated dated 1974,
which wasn't actually incorporated for another three years.
I said, "That's good. One less thing."
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang now, a film so bad they named it twice.
But they clearly didn't watch it twice, because if they did
they might have spotted this bona fide clanger.
On the outside, this book is titled You Wouldn't Want To Live There.
But on the inside it's The Man Beneath The Uniform.
Should have called it The Fake Book Beneath The Photocopied Jacket.
SHE thinks it's funny.
Here we see the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
sending an e mail to fellow hacker, Plague.
Being a top secret e mail, she's going to want to encrypt it.
Wait, decrypting?
Oh, but that's the exact opposite of what she should have done.
Next thing, we'll find out her tattoo isn't really a dragon at all, it's a...
What's the opposite of a dragon?
Zombieland now, set in America.
And, listen, they're playing The Star Spangled Banner.
And, uh... Oh, dear.
That's a British roundabout
right outside the Washington, DC, Capitol building.
If I thought I was in the States but it turned out to be Swindon, I'd be furious.
Like this guy.
Nice place, huh?
So that'll be four explosions, right?
There's one, two,
three,
four,
five? That's not right. Quick, drive off before anyone notices.
