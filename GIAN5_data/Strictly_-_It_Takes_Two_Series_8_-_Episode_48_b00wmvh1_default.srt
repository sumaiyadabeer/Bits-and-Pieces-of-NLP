We will see you tomorrow evening, Hello, welcome to Wednesday's
Strictly Come Dancing, It Takes Two. Coming up on tonight's show: Scott
lost his shirt and almost his place in the competition after slipping
into the bottom two for the first time. He's here with Natalie in a
moment. As the semi final draws near, Erin
draws us so sift through the most telling training clips in her mid 
week report. And three of Strictly's favourite
boys, kedgein, Austin and Colin are back to give their take on who's
looking good for a place in the final.
With the competition getting more fierce each week, even three nines
were not enough to save Scott and fatly from the bottom two. Here's
what happened.    Scott and Natalie from the
bottom two. Here's what happened. I'm going to give it everything
I've got. I'm going to be coatally committed, totally focused. This is
bond. We have to live up to that reputation. This is high stakes.
We've got to attack it. We want to win it. Scott, you've got the
license to thrill. You were giving Gavin a run for his money in the
chest department and you make a fine Bond. 00 7! You had passion,
you had posture, performance. thought it was vir aisle, red
blooded and hot. He's back. I hope we've done enough. I think we have.
I hope we've done enough. The first one didn't go very well, I was like
watch this, bang. That's one of the most difficult routines out there
tonight. Really? Why didn't you tell me that at beginning? Please
welcome Scott and Natalie!
The weekend must have been quite confusing for you then, you go out
first, you do this amazing routine. You get three nines. How shocked
were you to be in the bottom two? think in my mind I knew from the
two previous dances that potentially it could be a problem,
personally. You know, Blackpool we were kind ever starting, it didn't
go too well. The week after the smooth, I near enough stopped. So I
think the public's perception of the celebrities is they're
following their journey. And we'd had a dip. I wasn't that surprised.
I was surprised, but I wasn't like shocked, you know people were like
"You must have been shocked." No not really. I've been there for two
weeks. I know what that felt like. We hadn't got to the levels we'd
pre yuesly got to. It was understandable. How scared were
you? You were with Ann and did you think, oh, you know what we're
going to be fine? We got called out first. I thought that's not too bad,
when Ann got called out with us, I thought this is really scary. I
thaully thought we couldn't beat Ann Widdecombe. So I was extremely
nervous and I didn't want to go. I don't what End the jurgey with
Scott yet. I want to know I've danced every dance with you.
said it was a very difficult dance. I imagine the shirt ripping was
quite, not because your chest is disgusting, but I imagine it was
complicated to get the timing right. Were you worried about it? In the
rehearsals the shirt is attached to Scott's underwear. Nice. It was
difficult to get the shirt off. I almost broke my thumb doing it the
second time. Your thumb, my... Thank you! You've got three
routines this weekend. How hard has it been to get your head round the
fact there's not one, there's three? Initially there was blind
panic when we were told about three. Strangely enough, the week has gone
very well. Has it? Yeah, it has. And I'm excite bd it. I'm in a
different place with my energy actually. I was quite down the last
three weeks. I think that showed and had its effect on performance,
definitely. But... You're near the finish line and you think I'll go
full throttle. It's been such a brilliant experience. It is
genuinely. I'm not just saying it. Good and bad, it's been such a ride.
Nat's been a brilliant partner. You know it's going to ends, you don't
want to go out like that. I wanted to go out doing my best. I want to
go out on a high. I've embrace today again this week and gone back
to the energy I had when I started which is come on let's have fun,
let's enjoy it, do it hard, break a sweat and dot best you can, learn
it so you're not afraid. If you don't mind me saying, you have
brilliant dances for a semi final weekend. Because charleston, full
of character and the Argentine tango. Once you've got a knee flick
in, people go mad or I just stand up at home clapping like a loon.
Are you pleased that you have those two dances? Very happy. Two diverse
dances. Argentine tango is very intimate and serious and strong.
Then the charleston is all about personality. Scott's really
embracing the charleston. I love it. It's so you. I cannot wait to see
you guys dot charleston. How much do you want to make it to the
final? Do you have a responsibility to each other to get there? I do.
do. I do. I do. No, I do. That's good. It's literally, I
think the journey is so close now aren't you, it's only one week and
you know you think that you're out, it's all over. But come the week
after, everybody's out. It's all finished. I would like to finish it
and finish it on a high. These dances suit me better. I cannot
wait. Before we say goodbye to you, every year Scott just to fill you
in, we give the pro dancers a challenge. How do you think you did
in yours? Dreadfully. Let's have a Watch the screen
Step on the right note at right time and gain points
Miss a step on the wrong note and lose points, music maestro.
What is this? A piano clearly. I am normally musical until I get given
I got it in the end. The last bit. I was so bad at it. So bad. I think
if it was a normal piano, I would have probably topped the
leaderboard on that one, because I can use my fingers quicker than I
can use my feet. I tried and I'm sure I failed miserably. You are so
sweet Natalie Lowe. James is at the top of the leaderboard with 338
points. I knew he would be. Quite competitive. Shall we see how close
you are to him. Let's reveal your score. This is you in the
leaderboard. What? Oh, my God. told you. I did it. It's like we
gave her her own glitter board. that James underneath her? In your
face! Take it! James Jordan! James Cordon is not a professional dancer.
Thank you so much. Good luck. Scott and Natalie!
Now all I want for Christmas is
improved dance skills. That's not strictly true. But judging by the
amount of questions we receive for Len, a lot of you do.
Could you give me something to ease the pain
To ease the pain Dock, dock, dock, doctor beat
It's Len!
How are you? Perky. That's my word. OK, we have dancing ailments.
You're here to cure them. Come on. I'm ready. I've scrubbed up and
ready to go. You look delightful in blue. All right this is from Anton
Forever, "Hi Len, my husband and I have been married for three weeks.
Would we be better off learning the Latin or ballroom? "Which is the
most romantic. Three weeks they're still liking each other. They can't
keep their hands off each other. The dance has got to be Latin and
it has to be the rumba. The dance of romance. The dance of love. They
can pram tis all that hip action and caressing. They shouldn't be
romantic, Hollywood glamour, foxtrot? I'm thinking three weeks,
confined space. Love it. You know what I mean? You can't go floating
round the bedroom doing a foxtrot. But a bit of sensual hip action in
the mirrored wardrobe, hey? What! That's what you want. Or Domino's.
Or that, yeah. The next problem is on tape. My name's Paul. My
question is, in Latin how can I loosing up my top half and arms and
look manly. A good question. Paul I'm telling you what, it's a good
question and you're right it's difficult. Because you see, there's
two types of upper bodies. You get the stiff and you get the floppy.
And for me, a stiff one always beats a floppy one every time.
You want to be, I'm saying stiff, I
don't want them stiff. I want toned up. OK. Now, it's the upper body,
it's your arms. Now your arms are made of up of joints. Correct of
the Shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand. OK. You want   It's become biology.
Look, show me. Not too limp at the end. We hate that little flicky.
That gives it a softness that's not masculine. You want the hand quite
strong. These three fingers together. I'm in the a boy. Then
you, look pick up an olive. That's a girl. The girl pick up a olive.
What does the boy do, this is for Paul remember. You have, the thing
that gives the hand shape is the thumb. Take it away, see? That's
what gives it shape. Yes! As the French say a hand without a thumb
is like a kiss without a moustache. And I go with them. I go along with
it every time. So I'm saying Paul three together, finger there. Use
your joints and don't flick at the end. It's a sentence. This is my
arm full stop. There's the full stop. Don't get that extra bit like
you're revving a motorbike. Whoop. That's very good advice for Paul.
Isn't it? Still manly but beautiful. Manly, yes in a romantic way. Come
on. He's going to be delighted. He'll like that. Then we've got a
letter from DP1992. Not sure that's what they were Christianed. "Len,
in the jive and charleston, I struggle with the leg flicks and
kick. They either feel flimsy, clumsy and understated or I lose
balance. How can this be helped? Please help?" A flick comes from
the knee. A kick comes from the hip. That's the first difference. During
the jive and charleston you get this flicking action from the knee.
The first thing you have to get the ankle as though it's got a plaster
cast. So it's got to be... Stiff. In one piece. This has to be in one
piece. No softness through this ankle. You've got to get that, that.
So we could stand up and maybe just try to do a few little flicks.
try to do a few little flicks. wouldn't we? We're here. Now just
hold hands. Start with the right foot and flick it. Don't flap it.
Flick it. I have tassels. I can see that, yeah. It doesn't matter.
That's nice. From the knee. You're keeping this part still. Yeah, if
we were doing the hip it becomes a kick. We are flicking. Imagine
there's like a little, like a vole or weasel. Kick it in the botty.
don't like a vole. If it was on otter I would find this very
difficult., If you like, like that, like an ort. Let's try the other
one. Nice. Now you lose balance when you stand still, if you bounce
as you kick. Come on! Claudia, I'm loving it. Is that good? With
music? Let's do it with music. Hit the road Jack,
Don't you come back, no, no, no, no more.
Hit the road, Jack That was very good advice. You are
a brilliant boy. Let's hear it for Len!
Len!
Now, if you have a chronic dance problem that requires help, go to
our website and leave your Sorry, scratching my head. Here now
with her mid week report, please welcome Erin!
It is delightful you're here, even
though you've got that hideous machine. Of course, yes. Before we
do that, let's talk about the pro challenge. Do we have to? How do
you think you did? Terrible. I just saw Natalie, she was so good.
Let's see how you did. I was rubbish.
Watch the screen Step on the right note at the
right time and gain points Miss or step on the wrong note
and lose points, music maestro What is that? This challenge is not
difficult, if you can play the piano. Or play a musical instrument,
I would say. Sadly, I don't. Here Oh, no, no, no. G. C, C, C, C, B, A,
I would love to say I would beat
them all, but on this particular game, I think they've probably
beaten me. Actually all of them, sadly. You are very, very sweet. It
is time to reveal your score. Last year I should tell you you got zero.
Did I? Are you sure? It was a weird thing last year. Are you sure I got
zero. I thought I might have got one point. Yes. Are you ready to
see your score. All right then. There you go. Here you are on the
leaderboard. I beat James! Stop it. That's all people care about.
Congratulations.. Thank you. Let's talk about the mid week training.
With the machine. There are a lot of dances to talk about. Instead
you've watched all and chosen one you've watched all and chosen one
dance per person. Yes. Let's look at Gavin and Katya. Viennese waltz.
He starts with reverse turns here. His posture, he's a little bit down.
He needs to stand up tall, be proud to be in the final. His arms are
droopy. A bit skipy. So what I've done is stopped it about now.
There's another man in there. have a problem here. First of all
I'd like to say I've lost my arrows and circles. Thank goodness. They
took them away from me. Hallelujah. His posture look at the arm line.
That goes down there. It should go straight across. Plus he's up on
his tipy toes. What is he doing up there? His left foot should be up,
the other flat. Too much rise. Of course he skips all over the place.
But this is only Tuesday. there's time. I'm hoping. Press
clear. Now Matt and Aliona. You want to look at their tango. I've
seen this, they look amazing. Look at that. Nice flexed knees here.
He's sharp. Nice throw away oversway. But they're going into a
same foot lunge. She's on one leg. She has her weight on this right
leg. I can't even point to it. What he's done is he's swung his left
side, I'm going to make my arrows, there you go, can't stop me   he's
swung his left side around. Her right side here is swung open.
should have stayed straight Yes. She swings off here, right side
falls open. I don't know where he's going from here. He has to recover.
Bad, bad line. It should be striegt a   straight across, but it's not.
Thank you very much. Let's look at Pamela... I want my arrows back.
Don't make me cry. Now Pamela and James's quickstep. Did you know she
could do this. He's playing to one of her talents. We didn't know she
could tap. She's got a great... that tapping? Yes. Love it. They're
falling apart here. Why? I think it's because they're just getting
it together. This is quite hard. That's lovely. Well it's not
looking so lovely. Oh. Step hop, they're going around and around
each other. What she's done here, lost her posture. If you can see...
She's halfway up in the air. I know. But shaping out to the right when
it should be shaping out to the left. Do you see that? She's lost
that bit of posture, he's got a great arm line. That's still good.
Also, she's looking to, I have to draw all over it now because you
have taken my things away from me. She's looking to the right. Her
eyes are over here. I'd draw eyes but I can't. She should be looking
to the left. OK. There you go. Please get rid of it. I've been
here too long. You'll never stop me. I know that for sure. Now Kara and
Artem's Viennese waltz. We're not going to look at a Viennese waltz.
This is a bit of their entry. Look at her arm extensions. Use the
machine, we can't see where her extension through Artem's arms and
Kara. Beautiful. Her hands extended like Len just said. She's circled
it. She does that beautifully. She's presenting to the audience.
Armography. Isn't that you    what you call it. It's like she can't
hear me. That is absolutely brilliant. I'm not stopping. Don't
stop me now. Let's look at Scott and Natalie's charleston. He's sort
of plodding through. It I'm hoping it will come together. We know he's
cheeky. This is the dance to be cheeky in. What I want to stop,
he's don a basic charleston, forward and back. His foot swifl
here, I can't really draw a foot swivel. I want to point out, he's
swiveling... There are the feet. Oh, yeah arrows. Give me my arrows back.
No. That's going in the river. you see him charleston, it looks
great. I think it's going to be brilliant for them. I think this
will be the dance for him. He's got to come out strong. If he wants to
stay in, he's got to come out strong. You know better than anyone,
it's mid week, before the semis. Everybody wants to get to the final.
How are they feeling? They should be starting to get their dances
together now. They're dancing them on Friday. They're feeling tired,
but they should be pumped up. I mean they've come to the semi 
finals. There's only five left. It's going to be a fight. Double
eviction this week. I know. Any of them could go. Yeah, yeah. They
have really got to go out there and give it their all. Thank you very
much. Take him with you. Haven't we got more to do? No, thank you very
much Erin!
If you've been watching over the weeks, by now you should know a lot
about dancing. Here's Karen Hardy with the next lesson.
Salsa, the hot and spicy party dance. Salsa originated in Cuba in
the 1920s. Merging influences from European and African cultures. In
the salsa, the Strictly judges are looking less at posture and body
positioning and more at whether the celebrity is able to master the
rhythm, embrace the party style and demonstrate good hip action. The
three things you want to see in a good salsa are: Small steps, the
foot movement should be contained beneath the body. Cuban motion.
This is the hip and body action, which comes from the at earnate
bending and straightening of the legs. The third thing is arm
styling. Arms are held at or slightly above waist level. With
movements always a natural result of what the rest of the body is
doing. One thing you definitely don't want to see in salsa is
straight legs. Over the series, there have been some really hot
salsas. This salsa shakes the winter blue as way. Whilst others
have left the judges cold. sucked the life out of the salsa.
But there has only ever been one 40! As we near this weekend's semi 
final, I'm joined by three magnificent men, who know just what
it's like to be. There welcome Colin Jackson, Austin Healey and
Gethin Jones! Gethin Jones!
Boys, this is dreamy. You look like
a Christmas band. In a good way, as if you've been suddenly going to
stand up. Are you enjoying the series? I've been enjoy it. Good.
Nodding from Austin. It's had a spark this year. Very exciting.
let me just throw this in to the mix, we haven't seen a female
winner since aleash ya. Kara and Pamela are very strong. Is it a
girl's year? Jackson says possibly not. What are you talking about?
Possibly not. I'm looking for Scott and Matt. They look pretty strong
themselves. I think gts Gavin. Gavin looks good with his top off.
I wasn't going to say that. That's the tactic you used to have.
thinking still, it might not be. You know women like their men and
women tend to vote more. You think? What do you think? Two off this
weekend? Yes. That's a shock. know. I find the whole thing a
shock. Let me ask you about Gavin. He's another... Yeah one of them.
Caveman. No, rugby, throw it behind you, it's gone. I assume that's
what happens. Are you proud of him? What do you think of his dancing?
think he's given hope to every rugby player. If you come on this
show whether you can dance or not you're going to get a long way in
the competition. Yes. He's been all right hasn't he? If you give him
another two or three... Years, he'll have picked it up. Dear, dear.
Come on, it's no that harsh. I'm an English rugby player. Sticking up
for the fellow Welshman? He turned the corner on Saturday. Has he left
it too late. He's been in the bottom two only once. He was
nervous on Saturday and a foxtrot was a great dance for him. I
thought he did a good job. He's not quite there maybe with the Matt and
Scott. I think he'd be the first to admit it. He's pretty competitive.
It might be a ladies' year. I was there Saturday. Pamela was amazing.
Three or four moves in a Viennese waltz and she told the story. James
was brilliant with the choreography. Are you so G you should do my job.
I think I'm on stand by actually. bet you are! I'm feeling a bit sick,
can you take over? Let me just ask you about Matt, because you must
know him from whatever code to use for Blue Peter years, how did you
always know he could dance? When you had the Christmas party did he
back flip? He back flipped all the time. That's worth a point, isn't
it? I spent three years with him travelling, he was brilliant at
anything he put his mind to. He's got a gymnastics background. He's
done a few West End things as Westminster. He can sing. He knows
his music and stuff. Has he done West End things? Through Blue Peter.
What like busking. His acting on Saturday night was amazing. Austin
Powers. That's Matt. He's so creative. It was completely
different. I don't think the judges really bought into it that much
unfortunately for him. Dias a viewer. Agree with Austin. Let me
ask you Colin. At this point it feels like a Matt/Scott race in
terms of the boys, no, no, I don't mean it about Gavin. He's not
watching. Who's got the edge? Their scores are so similar. They are
very similar. They're coming from different backgrounds. The acting
is needed and the dancing is in one. Matt's the dancer, Scott's the
actor and they need to combine. has the edge? Scott. What do you
think? Scott's been in the bottom two a couple of times now. Just the
once. I think, he's been saved but the problem is for him he's working
gets and he has three dance that's week. It's taken life four hours to
learn the show. I think Matt is naturally gifted. He can dance.
There's no doubt about. It he can move. Scott may have it for the
acting bit. It's necessary. I love this chat. This is like Loose Women,
but not! Very quickly, you did three dances for your final, how
difficult is it? How much of a (she gasps) to learn three? You get more
anxious when you're in the final. You are hoping that all three go
well. It's the only on the final night when you have to deliver that
dance, that's when you get really tight and unsure. But during the
training, that's fine. Is it? pick them up quicker towards the
end. This has been dreamy. We're going to carry on. Thank you Colin,
