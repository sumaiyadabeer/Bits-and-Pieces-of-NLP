and Ed Leigh, journalist and snowboarder
flew to Alaska to take part in an event like no other.
It's got pain written all over it.
Every year, 10,000 snowmobile fanatics gather
in Summit Lake in the remote wilderness of southern Alaska
to ride their sleds and party.
And to watch a unique race where the worlds of ski racing
and sled racing collide.
Make no bones about it, what we're about to do is dangerous.
Faster, faster! Come on!
Most competitors have years of experience in this dangerous race.
This isn't recreational snowboarding.
Ed and Graham have none.
You mean, people get injured.
Oh, yes. It could be worse than that, even.
Clear for take off, north west, wind 3206.
Clear for departure, north west.
Jack, why does everyone have planes in Anchorage?
Because there's no roads.
There's like 54,000 square miles in New York
  and probably 20 million people.
  Yes.
Alaska has 504,000 square miles and only maybe 6   700,000.
Yes. HE CHUCKLES
No one here.
What are you guys doing here?
We've come up for the Arctic Man.
Arctic Man. That's a great place to go.
How hard is it? Is it harder for the skier or the sled driver?
There's a lot of talent on both parts.
Because the sled driver, if he doesn't do everything right,
he'll completely screw the skier up,
because they're picking up the rope at about 80.
You're not selling this to me at the moment.
The skier comes off 5,000 ft in a tuck.
He just took both his hands off the wheel.
I'm quite impressed that you manage to fly
this plane with no hands on the joystick.
Oh, it's nothing.
I'm more interested in the social side, personally, Jack.
They have dance, music, the bar is set up all out of tents
and motor homes and it's pretty wild.
Brilliant.
So, I need a hat. Check these out.
  How about that one.
  No!
  Yes!
Yes! I was looking for a kind of trucker cap.
Oh, there we go.
  ..Hand grenade.
  Yes, one of those ones.
The shop has been opened since 1971.
1971, yep! Where are you guys from anyway?
  We're from England.
  From England?
  We've come to do Arctic Man.
  Wonderful.
Yes, we're going to be 90 mph behind a Skidoo.
I know, that's very dangerous.
There are some casualties in that.
Touch wood, we'll be OK.
When you say casualties, do you mean people get injured?
  Oh, yes. Yes, they could.
  Right.
And it could be worse than that even.
Come on.
Switch.
I knew in the back of my mind how hard it was going to be.
Turn. Over the style.
Require an incredible amount of physical fitness.
And strength and endurance.
OK, tucks. Minute and a half.
Ready, steady, go!
I know that to stay tucked
for four and a half minutes, I've got to have some leg strength.
I'm not going to do that on will and determination alone.
And knee bends.
We were doing one and a half minute repetitions of thigh work.
Now, we're going to hit the rollers.
Ready, steady, go!
I might think my best is about 1 minute 50.
And I was screaming.
Come on, feel the burn.
I've got to do four and a half minutes. I'm not even halfway!
Absolutely ludicrous.
It's got pain written all over it.
Breathe, breathe. Ten seconds to go.
How many?
  Ten.
  No.
Ed is really worried about this one.
This one has got Ed pretty nervous.
Three, two, one, go.
Being on a snowboard at that speed,
if you go down, you'll go down really hard.
I fell over at 40 mph this winter, and compacted like a squeeze box.
Ribs and shoulders going everywhere.
The thought of doing the same at 60, 70 mph...
I really want to win this.
This is going to be a big one for me. I must win.
I think he'll be disappointed if he doesn't.
That's it.
We'll make a downhiller out of those thighs yet.
I hope Graham hasn't bitten off more than he can chew.
Traditionally, he usually bites off more than he can chew for me.
Come on, let's go jog it off.
Because the location of Arctic Man is so remote,
hotels aren't going to be an option for Ed and Graham.
They need transport and they need accommodation, preferably
all wrapped up in the same package.
"King Of The Road"
Wow! There's tens of them. Ed!
It's this one! It's that one.
It's half as long again as anything else. It's massive.
Look at the size of that!
This is the mother ship. Wow, this is fantastic.
Whether he's going to be saying that after a week,
we'll wait and see, shall we?
A road slug of epic proportions.
You can't run water through them, you can't take showers,
you can't run water to the sink.
Ed never takes a shower anyway. So there's a shower here.
I'd say we use this as your beer cooler.
Brilliant.
So no one at Arctic Man has got a shower for the week we're up there?
  Probably not.
  Are you guys ready to go to Arctic Man?
  Yes.
Right on! You guys have no idea what
you're getting yourself into. You guys should have a blast.
Need to go get some beer.
I need Super Noodles.
That's my staple. Carbohydrate for energy.
  Beer is currency, so we need lots and lots of beer.
And a bottle of Jack Daniels, as well.
Do you actually want to race, or are you just here to get drunk?
No, we've got to plan the post race celebration.
Situated at the very tip of North America, beyond even Canada,
Alaska might as well be a country of its own.
So far removed is it from the rest of the USA.
My map. I am the navigator, after all.
There's three roads in Alaska.
If you get lost in Alaska, you shouldn't be driving.
Ed and Graham's two day drive from Anchorage to Summit Lake
begins in spectacular style as they pass through the Chugach Mountains.
Seen as the Holy Grail by many skiers and snowboarders,
this range gets more snow fall than anywhere else in the world.
They're a sight no self respecting mountain lover
would ever want to miss.
Look at this one.
You could pretty much put a helicopter on the top of that
  and ride the whole thing.
  Top to bottom.
Look at these open faces.
What do you think the snow will be like up there?
  Really, really good.
  Yes. THEY LAUGH
It's just a vast expanse of craggy peaks.
But they aren't like vertical, they're all rideable
in some way, shape or form.
Looking at mountains like this, everything that they can offer you,
some of the most incredible experiences of your life.
But also these have got to be some
of the most dangerous mountains on Earth.
What time is it now?
8:10 in the evening. And it's still really light.
And a full moon. You could ski or snowboard
here until nine, ten o'clock tonight.
  Shall we take a picture?
  Yeah.
It'll take an awful long time getting to Summit Lake
if we keep stopping like this.
It's wondrous.
  Shall we get back in the car?
  Yes. Go on.
Hi, how is it going, you good?
Good, how you doing?
Really good. Have you got any advice for me?
Are you here to win?
I'm here to, as a snowboarder, I'm here to survive,
  Graham is here to win.
My theory is it's the hare and the tortoise.
If I can hold on, I stand a good chance of placing.
  But I don't know.
  Half the field didn't finish.
That conversation pretty much confirmed my worst fears,
the fact that only half of the field actually finish.
The trick is on the release,
get opposite your snow machine, make sure you're rip chord has a bungee in it,
so you get opposite your snow machine, so you load up the chord.
When he goes this way, you pull around.
So you whip yourself off the line?
The key is, when you let go, don't let your arms go wild
cos you're going 80 mph and it would pull you back.
When you let go, pull your arms in and stay straight.
He's talking 80 miles an hour.
80 miles an hour!
It's such a different ball game on a snowboard than it is on skis.
So you've got a flat section there that you need to whip over?
Stay smooth, stay quiet and glide as long as you can.
You'll see when you get up there,
  but this is a crucial part of the course here.
  That's where you'll win it. I'm telling you.
  I'm not telling Graham this.
  Did you get sultanas and raisins.
  No.
  You going to get sugar?
  No.
  Anyone get any chocolate?
  No.
  Anyone get any biscuits?
  No.
Next morning, the boys leave the highway
and head west from Glennallen.
They've now travelled 270 miles from Anchorage,
but that's just a drop in the ocean when you consider Alaska
is nearly 600,000 square miles in total.
Next stop, Paxson.
The best thing about American petrol pumps, hands free.
We're about ten miles from Summit Lake, a place called Paxson.
And you do really feel that you're in the back of beyond here.
What's it like living in Alaska? What's the reality of it?
I wouldn't live anywhere else. In this state, you can do anything.
  Do you think it takes...?
  Hunting, fishing, you can do car racing,
you can do whatever you want, you pick it, it's here.
You want a suntan, you get one this afternoon, I guarantee you'll get burnt up!
Would you describe this as the last place that can actually,
realistically provide the American dream?
What's the logo of Alaska? "The Last Frontier".
Look at what you've got. Look out there.
What you got? You think you can have somebody standing around
and you can step on their toes?
You leave the roadway in Alaska and you go ten miles,
there ain't nothing around you except you and the wilderness,
  unless you're in somebody's backyard.
  Yes.
  And I don't see too many backyards around here, do you?
  No.
I'm looking forward to getting my skis on and getting up
onto the track and checking the track out.
I think once we have a look at the track,
I think Ed's nerves will start to settle a bit.
Cos I think with everyone saying, "Oh, it's really tough,"
everyone we've spoken to has said, "Oh, you're crazy,
"you're going to get hurt, stay safe!"
And I think that has kind of freaked Ed out a bit.
  You ever been here before?
  No.
  Go have fun.
  You don't like having fun, go home.
Because you're going to have fun.
  They'll have to cut that smile off your face!
  Excellent!
Driving in, it looks like this building is Paxson.
It is. This one building.
You're in the middle floor so you're in midtown.
If you're to go upstairs, you'd be uptown.
If you're downstairs in the basement, you'd be downtown.
How many people live in Paxson?
Seven.
Arctic Man comes to town, you've suddenly got 7,000 people.
Anywhere from 10,000 on up.
  Really?
  Every year.
  And you've stocked up on beer?
Oh, yeah. 16,000 worth!
Can you imagine building this road?
It was built in 1898. Oldest highway in Alaska.
So, this is 190. When do we turn off, 197?
  Yeah, seven miles to go.
  Seven miles to go.
Nervous?
Yeah, I am. I'll be really happy once I can see the course,
get my head around it, have a couple of runs. Are you?
It's just that anticipation before you get into town.
You know, make no bones about it, what we're about to do is dangerous.
I saw you yesterday and you put your race face on.
It was Race Graham, started coming to the fore yesterday.
Yeah.
  I can see it in your eyes today. Look at that!
  Wow.
Cor, they're good mountains.
The Hoodoos!
Arctic Man takes place deep in the Hoodoo Mountains.
They may be less well known than the Chugach Range, but the Hoodoos
are still an impressive sight,
rising to 4,528 feet above sea level.
Is it just me or are we in the middle of nowhere?
There's just nothing.
There's a little sign saying Arctic Man.
Arctic Man, here we come.
You guys are in site nine, which is actually next to the beer tent.
Beer tent? Great!
Things are looking up.
They've positioned us right next to the beer tent. How did they know?
Looks pretty interesting.
It's just going on, and on, and on.
That's like 174, 175.
We're supposed to be site number nine. What do they say? That's 197.
No, no, we're in nine.
  Site nine.
  Yeah.
  We don't have a space.
  Don't we?
  No.
We have a favour to ask.
  What's that?
  Can we borrow some Skidoos?
Oh, man! You're in the wrong spot for Skidoos.
This is the Polaris booth, here. This is the good stuff, right here.
Ed, Ed. Skidoo is a brand name. A snowmobile.
Right! Oh, good sleds?
  People who drive them are called...
  Snowmobilers.
  Sled heads!
Yeah, sled heads!
See this section, here?
Yeah.
This is the fastest part of the course.
The top speed they've ever recorded here
is 90 miles an hour behind a sled.
In the distance, over there, is the start.
See that canyon? That's where the course comes down through.
We're doing 90 miles an hour and the course is...
Even if I average 60 miles an hour,
  that is a five and a half minute race.
  Yeah.
I've done two and a half minutes when I was 23 and I was sick.
We're both too old to be doing this. You've got your knee brace on.
I think you should put your body armour on.
Body armour's good.
It's always an admission you're doing something
quite dangerous, when you put it on.
This turn here is the hook up.
This is the most important part of the course because
you've skied down this canyon, you meet your sled driver,
he passes you a handle, you grab a hold
and you shoot off off that jump, there.
Let's go up to the start.
This is so wrong.
I want to make it clear at this point
that you have two edges. You can stand up on skis.
Oh, I'm quite happy to admit...
If I'm doing the same speed as you on one edge,
instead of two, it's a whole different kettle of fish.
The chances of me getting it are about tenfold to you getting it.
So, this is the start.
Straight line down here, pick up speed in to that canyon.
This is not recreational snowboarding.
That's important because the snowmobile kicks up
so much ice and snow.
Look how far away it is.
Now, come and meet our drivers.
  This is Carly.
  Nice to meet you.
Carly, nice to meet you, too. How's it going?
Carly's one of the fastest sled riders in the whole of Alaska.
She comes from a sledding dynasty.
I just kind of told my dad I wanted to do it.
He was the one who found me the snowboarder.
For me it's faster, slower, just right.
Ed, I'm blessed to do with him.
His awesome. I couldn't ask for a funner guy to be with.
I've got a pretty fast rider as well...
But he's not here right now.
You get the sub!
John has done this race... How many times?
10, 11, 12. Something like that. I lost count.
You don't sound too bad a stand in.
So, with John standing in until Graham's sled partner
Todd Minnick arrives on site, it's time for the boys to have
a closer look at the course and check out the competition.
Look at that, that's fast.
That was a really quick one.
The thing is, this release, he's coming over,
watching them release here.
Once you release,
it's a straight line to the finish.
It is and it isn't. That is a blind roller.
Just get the line right on that?
Get the line right, you'll be fine(!)
If you survive picking up your sled,
whipping off the end of your sled, then the blind roller.
If you do the blind roller, then it's coast to the finish.
There's no coasting in this.
It's racing! Full gas, all the way down. Coast?
A bit nervous, now I've seen all the other guys in their lycra.
A lot of tubby dudes.
As soon as I started seeing everyone else in Lycra,
it kind of hit home that you're back in that competitive environment.
I could almost feel my stomach start to contract and twist up.
I'm not into this,
"Here some timing gear, how quickly can you get down the hill?"
It puts me on edge. I don't feel comfortable with it.
Graham's just thriving on it.
It's like chucking petrol on a fire.
Here we go, let's have a look at the top.
It's pretty rough...
..up here.
Got to smooth this down for the race.
Trucking along.
It's funny tucking without ski poles.
Instead of tucking like that, you're like that.
And that all feels fine. Come through the gully
and then this transition period, this is the key.
This is my first go at this.
All I basically do is just ski in
and hope that the sled driver can match his speed to mine.
Here we go.
Here's the handle. Got it, pull wide. Here we go.
Mess up here and that's it. Race over.
It cannot be allowed to happen!
God, this is going to be tough in the race.
The release is the most fun.
Probably doing about 85, hopefully we'll get up to 90 miles an hour.
Just bang back on the rope.
Then ping forward for the release.
Then it's full on downhill again, down to the finish.
Ah!
That's a leg burner.
Ah.
Yeah, it's gonna be tough.
Physically, this is going to be much tougher on Ed.
Ah!
It's been such a long day.
I am absolutely exhausted.
It's hideous.
And those little legs of his...
I knew my legs weren't strong. I haven't ridden for three weeks.
When he's getting pulled, he can only really hold on with his front hand.
The course was rough, though.
Your legs are working like pistons.
I reckon I went down at probably 45, 50.
Oh!
I remember the line coming across my body and I remember throwing it right
across so that my shoulder went down first and I did almost a backspin
before my heel edge caught and that threw me up.
I actually got flipped over and whiplashed my head into the ground.
I saw bright lights for a second, which is never a good sign.
I'm going to need so much more juice in my legs.
I feel like I've been thumped by Mike Tyson with an adrenalin fist.
I don't think I'm going to win.
I think I'm gonna win. I still think I'm gonna win.
Right up until the point that I don't!
I can't wait for bed.
I'll have a massive meal,
try and get some carbohydrates in and then fall fast asleep.
Ed. Ed!
Wake up. It's 8 o'clock.
What's the weather doing?
It's a little bit snowy, but I think it's going to clear up.
  Come on, we got to go.
  A little bit snowy?
  Graham?
  Yes!
  Todd Minnick.
  Todd, how are you doing?
  Great.
  Brilliant, you're here.
My father started snowmobiling when he was 25 years old.
He started racing.
I grew up watching him race and helping him.
I just had to be a part of it.
It's a bit...snowy out there but I reckon we need to get
  some training done, we need to practise that hook up.
  Sounds good.
Winter is a long season up here. It starts in early November
and doesn't end till May. So if you don't snowmobile or ski,
it's pretty dark and cold and not a whole lot of fun.
You still hurting?
Really hurting.
I'm not sure if it's rib damage or just really badly pulled muscles.
I really don't want to get back into that suit, though.
Big shame about today's training, the snow came in and I didn't really
get the training with Todd that I would have hoped for.
It was so slow. There was probably about half a foot of new snow
on the top of the course. It meant that when we were
practising the hook up I would ski in but I was barely moving
and we were doing kind of hook ups in slow motion.
Ow!
  Is this the only race you do?
  Uh huh.
  Who are you towing?
  Sonny.
  Hi.
  Hi, Sonny. Snowboarding or skiing?
  I'm snowboarding.
In general terms, how dangerous would you say this race is?
Usually half the snowboarders don't make it through training.
I think Ed is starting to be a little bit more confident.
I feel a lot more comfortable with the speed.
I suppose it's like anything you're afraid of.
The more time you spend around it, the less frightening it becomes.
Carly is driving really, really well. She gave me a nice easy ride.
On about the first three runs, she just built up, built up and built up.
Second or third run, we got up to 86, the speed I was reading.
I know I got a slight whip off the end as well.
I'd like to think I was around 90 miles an hour.
If I was, it's the fastest I've ever gone on a snowboard by a long way.
The fact we finished training is a fair achievement.
And if you finish this, you're a winner.
The weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow...
We've got hat envy.
This one wasn't too lucky. It got under the wheels of my four wheeler.
Make no mistake, it's dangerous out here in Alaska.
That is the hat to fit in in Alaska! Arctic wolf.
I know that hunting is a way of life up here...
Rargh!
..but wearing it on your head, it's not necessary!
With 10,000 spectators gathered for Arctic Man
there's plenty more wildlife to be found outside.
I see the bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way...
  Now, you're in charge of all of the police here.
  Yes.
The business starts for you tomorrow.
From the looks of it, I think it's going to start tonight.
This is a big event. We call it the third largest city in Alaska.
The largest city is Anchorage.
Then we have Fairbanks, and then we have Arctic Man.
The snow is great, the people are great, and it's the last time
we have fun before summer starts so we can get back to work. Yeah!
Drag racing on snowmobiles.
He is nailing it! He's about 12.
I want to have a go.
Night time drag racing.
Nitrous, turbocharged, 300 horsepower sledge.
Fantastic.
He did it!
So, can you win?
In my heart of hearts, I know I can make it.
I've started to relax and get comfortable with that kind of speed,
develop a technique, trying to get as much on the back foot,
and lift the nose, so I'm almost skimming at that speed,
so I can't catch an edge.
But it is, it is that... It isn't, "I know I can do this,"
there's a vast amount of luck involved.
What about you?
There is only one goal in mind, and that's to win.
  I would not be happy with anything else.
  Really?
  You wouldn't be happy with second or third?
  Not really happy, no.
I'm really frightened about tomorrow.
Keeping it under control and there's no way I'd show it to Graham,
He'd eat me for breakfast if I showed him I was scared.
But I have a lot of other stuff to live for.
  Leave me alone.
  It's race day.
  It's race day.
Excellent.
  Look at you. I've never seen you in such a good mood.
  It's race day!
Are you one of the Steve McQueen breed?
  When you're racin', you're livin'. Everythin' else is just waitin'.
  Yep!
Now, I'm worried about this.
It's got pain written all over it.
Are you at all scared?
Yes. Yes, I mean, I could crash.
Each team can only race once.
So, Ed and Graham's one chance to be crowned Arctic Man is to conquer
a five mile course that's twice as long as an Olympic downhill.
And in the Olympics, they don't have sleds to worry about.
OK. Let's do it.
Come on!
I was tucking down the canyon, just trying to stay relaxed.
And then just as I got before the pick up,
I was clapping my hands a bit so my hands were ready to grab the handle.
Here we go! Into transition.
Back up.
We went through the tight turns OK.
The canyon was just an absolute mogul field.
The sled in front of you was just bouncing up and down.
You're just doing your best to hang on.
Pinned it along the top.
And my legs were burning.
Absolutely burning. I was just going, come on!
'Come on!' Come on!
That's it, that's it!
Just trying to stay as low and aerodynamic as possible.
But the pain was just immense. 'Come on!'
One thing that worked really well was the release.
You come over this blind rise, just as he cut across in front of me,
I cut like almost a water skier crossing the wave.
Pulled on the handle like that, and just pinged it.
So the release worked really well.
I had tons of speed as I flew over the jump.
And then, basically another 35 seconds to the finish,
and all you have to do is just stay as low as possible.
Oh, yes!
Came across the finish line and it's a mixture of pain and elation.
Yes! It's a huge adrenaline rush...
Come on! ..that you've managed and you've survived it.
Come on!
I saw my time, and oh...
Third place, but I'm not going to stay there.
  The course is getting rougher.
  Yeah, the course is a bit too rough.
Ooh.
At that point, I was in third, so it wasn't that bad,
but there was still a couple of really good skiers to ski.
If Ed makes the finish, he'll be doing really well,
the track on the pull is really, really rough.
It's pretty horrible. I almost lost it twice.
If Ed makes it through, even if he makes the finish,
it'll be a massive achievement.
There is a bright spot but all of that cloud is coming in.
Yeah, you guys just take it easy,
  cos it looks like it's going to be...
  It's all about survival today.
Stay left, it's good. The right is where it's bad.
Really, really deep holes.
It's the flight that's really bad.
Calm down. Calm down.
I'm nervous for Ed. Everyone has been crashing in the canyon.
I just want him to stay on his board.
Three people in front of me have dropped out.
I don't know why they don't want to go.
The conditions have become a problem. Heavy cloud has moved in,
the light is fading and the course has become dangerous.
With many competitors dropping out of the race,
Ed has to make the call whether to risk it.
I can see in this.
It's not that flat.
A lot of the sled drivers said the track was more rutted
by five or six teams in, than it was on Wednesday for practice,
which was the worst it was supposed to be.
It was supposed to be really smooth today,
and I got yanked every which way in there.
It's so hard. Just thinking of the what if, what if?
Oh!
Already I'm thinking, if there were two runs,
that I would have known what to do.
The awful thing for me is that if I hadn't had the second fall,
then I probably would have been looking at a second or first place.
I'm tempering that with the fact that yesterday, all I wanted to do
was survive, and to be down here in one piece
is a wonderful, wonderful feeling.
Come on, we've got this.
What an amazing day.
A ridiculous day.
A very, very nerve racking, hectic, relieving...
..and exciting day.
  You all right?
  Yes.
I did what I said I was going to do.
Maybe we can come back next year!
Graham, your time!
  I'm in fourth.
  Fourth!
I missed the podium by 11 hundredths of a second.
You know you're the first male snowboarder down?
Everyone's calling it, they said it was too flat light.
He got 74.9 miles an hour.
I got 75.2 mph.
I may have been... I may have fallen,
I may have been really slow, but I went faster than him today
which I count as a small victory.
We did Arctic Man!
We are Arctic Men! Woo!
29 teams started Arctic Man.
Only 17 made it to the end.
And just like Graham in the skiers category, Ed also finished 4th.
All the way from London, England, Ed Leigh
and Graham Bell, ladies and gentlemen! Guys, well done.
These are real men!
Who wants a beer?
Forget about what could've been, let's look around outside.
  Ah!
  Hurray!
  What are you doing out here?
  Waiting for you guys!
  Are you not allowed in?
  No.
  Oh, right. Under age!
  Under age!
  No ID!
  It's not like you've got a fake ID, is it?
  Course not!
  Thank you so much.
  Yes. Thank you.
  I feel like I let you down in the end.
  No! Absolutely not!
  If you hadn't crashed, you'd have won.
  Don't listen to him.
Right, we're going to go and find the best of this place!
Ain't seen my baby since I don't know when
I've been drinking bourbon whisky, Scotch and gin
Gonna get high, man Gonna get loose...
I'm awesome, how are you doing?
Is this the kind of hat that Americans wear
  or is it just for tourists?
  Tourists!
  Hey, shall we go and see that one?
  You know what's funny...
it says made in Vietnam!
  Where are you guys from?
  We're from the BBC.
  The British Broadcasting Company?
That's Alaska. See it? Right there's Fairbanks.
Get the right hand. Here's where we are, right here.
And we're having a good time, right there,
and we're going to get drunk and race my sled.
  How fast does your sled go?
  About 110 mph.
Right, I'm not going anywhere near the back of your sled!
  My body hurts so much.
  You could have won it!
I could have won it, just as you could have won it, but we didn't.
I'll be honest,
I really don't want to see another sled for a while either.
Every single hill you look up, there's sled trails.
Sled trails as far as the eye can see.
As a snowboarder, it starts to grate,
watching all of the sleds just tearing up perfect mountains.
So will you be back?
I'll be back to Alaska. I just don't know if I'll be back to Arctic Man.
