Hay, hay, hay...
One day an ant went wandering
Far off the anty track, track, track
He climbed the kitchen window sill
And then came running back, back, back
Now gather round, said one little ant
I've found a fresh fruit pie, pie, pie
It's way too big for me to lift
Let's go! the ants all cried, cried, cried
The ants climbed up the window sill
And tried with all their might, might, might
To lift the pie into the air
And claim that sweet delight, light, light
Stop right now! said one little ant
We've got to get this right
If we don't find a better way
We'll be up here all night, night, night
Let's make a team and lift that pie when I go, 'one, two, three'
Together we can do it if we work in unity
A one, two, three and a one, two, three
And a one, two, three, one, two, three, three
They tried and tried till their legs got tired
But you can't beat gravity
So one little ant thought long and hard
And came up with plan B, B, B
If each of us just bites that crust
We'll take it piece by piece, piece, piece
So bite by bite, crumb by crumb
They carried it away, way, way
Till all that sat on the window sill
Was an empty metal tray, tray, tray.
Ha ha! That was great!
A kite! What fun! I haven't flown a kite in...ages!
  Ken, do you want to fly a kite with me?
  No, thanks.
The last time I ended up in a tree.
I'm too small and light to hold a kite.
You just need a Ken size kite!
Let's call Scrapboy and see if he wants to fly kites, too.
Hi, Scrapboy. I'm on a kite flying mission.
Want to join in? Over.
Yes! It's a windy day and perfect for kite flying.
I have kite building materials. I'll bring them over. Over.
That would be great. Ken needs a Ken size kite. Over.
I have just the thing. We'll make kites for everyone.
I'll be right over. Over and out.
Mm. It's getting windier.
  We may have to put the kite flying off for a bit.
  Why?
I have to make sure my plants are safe in this wind.
Some of the tomatoes are ripe and they need to be picked NOW.
I don't want them to get blown off and hit the ground with a squish!
That would be a real waste.
Where is everyone going?
Dirtgirl is going to check on her tomatoes.
It's a bit too windy for me to be out in the open at the moment.
Great idea, Ken.
Let's head underground and plan the latest stunt!
Happy planning, you two. Bye!
This is a tomato.
Tomatoes grow on a tomato plant.
These tomatoes look happy
and some are red and ripe and ready to pick!
These small ones are still green, but they'll be ready to eat soon
when they're big and red.
Tomatoes need a lot of sunshine to ripen.
Hey, sun!
Can you please send some sunshine over here on these tomatoes?
I love tomatoes. I tie the plants up when they are big and heavy
so they don't fall over.
The trickiest thing about tomatoes is that they are a fruit.
I always thought a tomato was a vegetable
but experts say that a tomato is a fruit
because there are seeds inside the part we eat!
Ha ha! Amazing!
Plump and juicy, soft and sweet, tomatoes are a fruity treat.
Thanks for all your help, Scrapboy. I think they're as safe as can be.
No problem. Now to build some kites!
That's a kite?
It's a box kite. It's called that because it's shaped like a box.
Naturally. It's fantastic, Scrapboy.
Let's get it in the air.
Ha ha! My favourite thing about flying kites
is that there are no batteries required.
The wind gives you all the power you need.
Yes. It's just you and the wind and the great outdoors.
Wait for me, Scrapboy!
That's a funny looking kite, Scrapboy.
It's a great kite. It's very strong.
Oh, is it?
Could it support, say, the weight of a weevil
and still get up in the air?
Yes. I suppose a kite this size could stay up in the air
with that much extra weight. Why?
I have a great idea for a stunt! It includes an airborne weevil!
Ken, to be exact.
As long as he has his safety jacket on, he'll be fine.
Er, does Ken WANT to fly around in a kite, though?
Ken's a stunt bug.
I'm sure he will be thrilled!
Everyone seems to be kite crazy today.
I've even made one for Velma. Who knew chickens liked to fly kites?
Calling all Greenthumbs!
I challenge you to grow tomatoes.
Ripe and ready to pick! Mm, tomatoes!
Tying up the plants to grow tall and strong.
Old stockings are great to do that job.
They'll grow into beautiful tomatoes.
Thanks, Greenthumbs!
Stunt time!
Ladies and gentlemens,
if you will direct your attention to the centre of the ring,
you will find our very brave stunt bug, Ken the weevil!
Ken will attempt to set a new weevil flight record
with the amazing Kite Flying Weevil stunt.
Put your hands together for Ken the weevil!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ahh!
Don't worry, Ken.
The string is very strong and you have your safety jacket on.
Hey, this isn't so bad.
Oh, what a view.
Well, most of them ARE tiny bugs, but still...
Huh?
Incoming chicken!
Reel me in, Scrapboy!
That was the best stunt ever!
  Very exciting!
Oh, Velma. You're always hatching a plan.
Back to the chicken yard with you.
Hay!
Oh, Ken. We have had quite a day!
The tomatoes are all safe and, more importantly, so are you.
And I intend to keep it that way.
Well, you won't get blown away like that, Ken!
But what if you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night?
Dirtgirl, how are you at untying knots?
Brilliant! Ha ha!
