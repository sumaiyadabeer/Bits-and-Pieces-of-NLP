Hello and welcome to the One Show Matt Baker And Alex Jones. Tonight,
a man who has had the daunting task of weighing up the achievements of
the leading figures from the past 70,000 years. Then deciding who is
in and who is out. We are about to his History of the World on our
screens. It's promising to be controversial. Please welcome
writer and broadcaster, Andrew Marr.
Andrew, you have had 15 months on the road. Have you been deciding
who is in and out. You have left out Henry VIII and the Battle of
Britain? Yes. Very interesting guy. Historically a fat sprat. Not a
world historical figure. The Battle of Britain, most people who watch
British television have heard of Battle of Britain I'm trying to
give them stories they haven't heard about. You have clocked up 80
flights. Travel something great. What did you do? You get bored of
airports. I used to run. My knees have gone. I have done sketching.
iPad much I don't have to carry around ink, pencils and all that
stuff. Do it all on this. How very now, Andrew? Exactly. Here is a
thing for you. Don't often say that. Not about me. Will you do a sketch
throughout the programme? I will do my best. Later we will meet the man
behind one of the most distinctive guitar sounds in pop. It's Level
42's Mark King.
With will meet doctors, nurses and health workers from a hospital who
workplace choirs. Shall we have a burst of something relevant? It has
to be relevant. Let's go. Don't let your self go
Cos everybody cries Ooh, and everybody hurts
Sometimes And everybody hurts...
What about that. Everybody hurts.
REM. We have a game like that coming up later. They have the
Gareth Malone shine on them, haven't they? Very good. The
posture and everything. If you have done something special with your
work colleagues, singing, putting a theatre group together, send us a
picture to: We will read out as many as we can throughout the
programme. Yesterday, we heard from one show viewers about small acts
of kindness that had inspired them to spread the love. Lucy meets a
remarkable man with a very, very big heart, Oscar Brogden who has
been havinglet same effect on the people of Gorton in Manchester.
haven't got much money. Why wouldn't I want to help people out
by putting money in their purse. Oscar Brogden, a security guard
here has co ordinated a city wide scheme to reunite people with their
lost and stolen wallets and purses. Oscar makes sure they don't go back
empty. At last count, Oscar had returned �1,780  1,780 wallets to
their owners. Joan had her handbag and purse snatched while she was
out shopping. I felt sick. I felt really violated. I wanted to have a
good cry. I did hold it back. About a week later, Oscar rang. When I
got my purse back, there was a lovely hand written letter in there
from Oscar and also �5. I thought, how kind of him to do that. That is
lovely. It really did bring a tear to my eyes. It really did. Oscar
earns �17,000 a year, which hardly puts him in the same League as a
City or United player, he regularly digs deep into his own pockets to
compensate the people who have had their purses lost or stolen. Oscar,
how much money, over the years, do you think you have given away?
�5,000. Where has that money come from? My pocket. It's your money?
Yes. Female students are the biggest victims. I'll send them �5
and pensioners. Really, really emotional when they get on the
phone and they have had their Christmas money taken. A few years
ago I put �80 in. I was going to buy a jumper. I thought, I have a
jumper, why do I want another one. I put the �80 in. She came back
here and I have a friend for life. How do you feel when people try to
give you a reward. I send a letter saying "please do not send me a
reward." Someone sent me �500, I had no hesitation giving it back to
him. What do you tkpwhet return? try to do my little bit for the
community with the help of the people who work here. His kindness
doesn't stop with returning lost and stolen wallets and purses. He
has saved thousands of old and rusty bikes that would end up on
the scrap heap, repairing them and handing them over to the community,
free of charge. We give four away a week to kids, member of staff. To
people who don't have transport or somebody who had their bike taken.
All these bikes end up on the tip. They are going back into the
community. I put �100 a month out of my own money. We make sure when
the bikes go from here they have got good tyres and good brakes and
good seats. Some of these children have never had a bike before.
has repaired and given away a stagger 3,5 81 bikes. The next four
are for a new life with local children. Liam. Thank you, Oscar.
Callum. Thank you, Oscar. Brandon. Thank you, Oscar. And victor.
you, Oscar. Who knows the big names like Bradley Wiggins, Chris Hoy,
one of these young people from around here might emulate that.
That would be absolutely sensational. I'm in Oscar's
workshop. Have you just seen it. He has his bits of pedals and bike.he
is not the tidest, as he freely admits. He uses everything he is
given to fix up these bikes and get them out to the local community.
Helen is here from the local community. You have worked with him
a few times? I have. My auntie works with Oscar. She let's me know
what he needs for the local people. People bring me food, bikes and all
sorts. Whatever he needs? Yes. me about the Christmas hampers he
does? I helped him wrap the hampers last year. The hampers that that
huge you can't lift them. Is there any limits to his generosity?
doesn't know the word "limit." Thank you. Helen is from the local
community along with lots of people who Oscar has helped, we have
persuaded them to come down here tonight to say thank you to Oscar.
He is such a modest man. We have one man who is liing in wait for
him, as we speak. Iwan Thomas, where are you? Well, thank you. I'm
hiding around here because today has Allardyce been about secrecy.
Oscar is such a lovely man. He doesn't like the limelight or a
fuss. Tough, Oscar, tonight we will make a small fuss. The people who
love you of this local community are turning out to thank you. You
know, I may have pulled a few strings. Stay tuned. As you saw on
the show earlier, on the little clip he loves Jason Kenny. I called
him up. Stay tuned. We will catch up with you later. He will be
distraught that people are filming in his workshop without him nothing.
You will unleash on the world, Andrew Marr's History of the World.
This is extraordinary. You have been reading for 30 or 40 years.
You feel ready in your life to say this is Watt I think about the
History of the World? Exactly. It has been a long, long time in the
making. I have spent three years stuck in libraries, as you say, 25
years before that just reading history. I have read a lot of
history over my life. OK, what are the really important moments, what
are the crucial turning points? It's not just, it's not our history,
not just European history, I brought in China, India and South
America. What was happening over there when stuff was happening here.
Linking it altogether. That is the hard thing. There is so much going
on at the same time? Absolutely. know what you left out, heny VIII
and the Battle of Britain. How did you decide where to start? I could
have done 13.5 billion years ago in the Big Bang. I thought, leave the
science to the scientists. Leave evolution to the byologists. Start
with the story of us. Mankind as we start to move out around the world
and change it. That is 70,000 years ago when, it's now thought, one
tribe breaks out of Africa and spreads around the world. All of us
not from sub Saharan Africa are related to that one tribe. One
woman in that tribe is our nearly universal mother. I find it
absolutely extraordinary and quite hard to believe almost. Yes, it is.
To help you tell your historical tales you have lots of reenactments.
Let's have a look. None of us can hope to know all of the human story,
but it does help to have the big picture because it's really the
story of who we are now. Our own ancestors long walk, the tiny
things that changed the world. Nature biting back. Old glories,
winners and losers. Truth seekers and astonishing discoveries.
Revolutions in blood and in iron. Modern madness and the wonders of
the digital age.
Modern madness, Andrew. That looks like it's a modern equivalent of
picture books that Andrew Marr marr as a child nel love with. If you
remember Ladybird books, all sorts of books. You are drawn in by the
pictures. With television, those kind of reenactments are the bright,
colour pictures which draw us in. The people who were down and filmed
all of those did a fantastic job. Speaking of the people who filmed
them. The cameraman rang up and said, ask Andrew about leaving the
woman in the desert? That is a terrible story. OK, really shameful
story. A wonderful woman, who was part of a museum, we were filming
the story of the Nazkar who have extraordinary priests with long
heads, look like they are out of science fiction. Bound together in
childbirth. She brought a skull down for us. She was going to her
own town to vote. We all went back in the next day. We were all
exhausted. We were heading back, about 200 miles north of where we
had been filming somebody said, "What about the woman?" We had left
her behind! She was standing outside... It was just the most
terrible thing. We were all on our way for a last, sort of, lunch then
we were going... We left her behind. Did you go back? Tell us you went
back? If we went back we would have lost the flights. We arranged a
luxury taxi to pick her up. Very good. It was the most shameful Alan
Partridge moment of the entire thing. Awful. I'm going to kill
Neil Harvey for telling you. That he is a dead man! We have our
sources. There are eight of these programmes. You are going up
against Downton Abbey as well. know. It's a great honour. Charge
the machine guns, mate with Downton Abbey. You are following
Countryfile. You will be all right. The programme starts this Sunday on
BBC One at 9.00pm. There is also a book to accompany the series which
People living in many care homes across the UK will be able to rate
how good or bad they think they are. The cost of paying the home's fees
can result in many families struggling financially and in some
cases unnecessarily. Across the UK, there are 400,000
adults who live in nursing and care homes.
Around 40% of people in care homes in England have to pay for some or
all of their care costs. The thing is, some of them shouldn't have to
pay anything whatsoever. David from Watford was 65 years old
when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. By April 2010,
his condition was so bad that he had to be moved into a nursing home.
Before he was ill, David was a very friend friendly, outgoing, social,
chatterbox. He loved life and he loved living. I was devastated when
I found out it was probably at zilers because I knew   
Alzheimer's because I knew what was going to happen. We had plans for
our future and our retirement and there wasn't going to be a pleasant
future, it was going to be upsetting and very sad.
In England and Wales, before someone goes into residential care
care an assessment can be made of their needs. If they are judged to
be medical then the NHS can pick up the costs, however if their primary
needs are not seen to be medical then the local authority will do a
means test before it decides how much if anything it will contribute.
The NHS assessment also takes into account ongoing care requirements,
but despite David's Alzheimer's and the care he needed, the NHS decided
they wouldn't cover the fees. I was horrified. I had hoped that
with all David's problems that he would have been covered by the NHS.
His primary needs got worse and worse. He started having seizures,
he had to be hoisted. He just went from bad to worse.
How much were you having to pay? was paying �1,100 a week.
And how did you afford that? From our savings. From when we retired.
We were using it up very quickly. David would have been horrified.
In December 2010, David passed away. By that time, the couple had paid
around �30,000 in fees for the nursing home. Susan still believed
her husband's needs had been wrongly assessed. So she went to a
solicitor. Two years later, the NHS have now
said that their assessment was wrong and they will now be
refunding all the care fees that she has paid. Do you think people
understand that they can go through this appeal process? No, it is a
complicated area and people aren't aware that potentially the NHS
could pay the full cost of their care.
Is it worth it? My firm represent 3,000 people and we have been
successful in recovering over �25 million in wrongly paid care fees
for 350 clients. The process is long. It is complex and it does
take sometime and sadly, families are waiting two to three years for
right decisions to be made. For Susan, the refund helped to
give her peace of mind that she will be comfortable in her
retirement. David would be over the moon. He
was a fighter. He was a terrier as he called himself! He wouldn't have
given up. If the boot had been on the other foot and it would have
been me, he would have fought. It has been the most stressful thing
that happened to me and I'm just so If you want to claim back care home
fees, there is a deadline at end of the month. This deadline only
applies to England. If you need more information on how
people living in the rest of the UK are affected, have a look at
website. It is all there. Anita has more news about the care homes
I have. This week the Your Care Rating initiative was introduced
which aims to rate care homes. Jane Ashcroft is from one of the care
providers who developed the scheme. Jane, how is this going to work?
Well, at this stage, there is 13 providers involved. 850 care homes
and the 50,000 people living there have an opportunity to fill in a
survey and say what they think about the care that they receive in
the place that they live in. So you are getting a snapshot in
time? That's right. Really importantly, the survey has been
developed by MORI and it is confidential and it will give us
that picture of what think people think are great and the things that
people need to improve. Even though it is care providers
who are behind it? It is independent. It is confidential.
All the results go to MORI and it is straightforward.
But what if my relative can't fill out that form? What then? Families
will be helping people and other friends will be helping people so
we want to encourage as many responses as possible.
How can we be sure that whatever their rating, whatever they are
telling us about that care home will be listened to and action
taken? A commitment from everybody involved. That's why we're asking
the question. There is lots of good things going on and we want to know
what residents really value so we can keep doing the good and improve
on the things that need to be improved on.
If a care home gets a negative rating, will we be able to see
that? We want all homes to be involved. We are the pilot group.
We want other homes to get involved as well. We're being to publicise
the information and then everybody will be able to look and say, "OK,
this is the quality of this home.". Often you hear stories about
neglect in care homes. But there are lots of brilliant care workers
like Karl Martin. You got an award. So what makes a good care worker?
think it is a genuine interest in people and what makes people tick.
Everyone in a care home has a history. They have lives they've
lived. They had joys and disasters, loves, every single person is
different. It is all ensuring that we treat people as individuals as
they deserve to be. You got your awards for activities.
Yes. What activities do you get your
residents to do? We try to lead on life story so it is very important
that I know as much about a resident as possible. We had a
wonderful example last year where one of our ladies had loved
swimming as a child, but when she had a husband and her family, she
had to stop. We took her to the swimming pools at her request and
for the first time in 60 years she got into that pool at the age of 92
and out swam the activities co  ordinator!
That's brilliant. For example, one of our gentlemen
flew a mosquito. We were able to unite him. He went to see that.
It is about being joyful. So what do you think about Your Care Rating,
do you think it is a good idea? is a wonderful idea. Up and doub
down the country    up and down the country, there are people who work
hard in care homes and this is a real opportunity for people to see
some of the great work that goes on in care homes.
Thank you very much indeed. Does all this make you think about
your old age, Andrew? I they we all have to face the fact that many of
us, perhaps if we're lucky are going to end up in care homes
because we'll have lived for longer and there are some great ones and
we know there are poor ones indeed. And the costs are just awesome and
phenomenal and most of us, I mean I'm as guilty as anyone, we tend to
think about tomorrow. We tend to think about next year, that holiday,
that car, we should be salting money away for the serious stuff.
Too much looking at the history. And not looking forward!
Earlier we met Oscar Brogden. does all sorts of amazing things
from fixing up old bikes and repairing them for children to go
and enjoy. To reuniting people with their lost property. He is a hero
in many people's eyes and Lucy is up to something!
Somehow, we've got Oscar here without him knowing what's going on.
Ewan is going to get him out of the car now and we're going to bring
him in. Everybody, nice and quiet. Hello, Oscar. I will take your hand.
Step out of the car. You are probably wondering why you're
blindfolded on this dark, cold and quiet night. If you walk with me
this way, all will be revealed in a minute.
Are you all right? I'm good, thanks. You are not too cold.
Well, you are live on The One Show. Mind your Manchester language! You
are going to see why you are here. Thank you.
Oscar, all these people are here
for you because you are such a lovely man and I know you don't
like a fuss. Thank you very much. You can put it
in a few words, top people. You never expect anything like this, do
you? Top people. That's all I can. Thank you very much. Well, you are
the top person. It is not just about the people here, we have got
a few other surprises, one of which is with Lucy now.
Hello Luy. We wanted to make it official. On
behalf of the One Show, and the people from the community, I would
like to unveil this.
Every time you come to your den, that is for recognition and to
remind you of what you mean to this community. You might not realise,
you have touched so many people here. Everything you have done, we
have got another surprise. Well all these bikes have been
donated by Manchester Police Force. Unfortunately they can't be here
because of yesterday's tragic events, but they wanted to say
thank you and give you more bikes to work on to help the youngsters.
Brandon, what does Oscar mean to you? He is one of the best guys in
the world. Oscar, can I have another bike? Of course, you can,
son, yes. How about you? What has Oscar done?
He got me a brilliant bike. What colour? Pink.
What does it mean? These are top people. I am an old bloke, I am
getting emotional. You are just brilliant, I can't fault you.
What do you think of Oscar? Just a walking angel.
What a lovely thing. We have got a special surprise, haven't we?
local community love you. I know you don't like a fuss, but there is
someone special who wants to show his appreciation, you are a fan of
British cycling. We have got double Olympic champion, Jason Kenny.
Look at that!
What a top man! Fancy meeting you in person. Wow. What a diamond. My
heart goes out to you. Well done, tremendous guy.
Jason, what do you think? Amazing, thanks a lot, mate. Thank you to
British cycling for getting all these kids out on bikes. Good work.
A lot of these people here were watching you on the telly and you
came and you did us proud. He is a very big fan.
We are very proud of you tonight. We could talk all night. You guys
live local, but me and luc have to get back to London.
We better make a move, Ewan. Oscar, see you later.
Lucy, wait!
There is so many people going on about a legacy and that guy there,
giving those little bikes and that young lad summed it up brilliant,
"He is one of the best guys in the world.". The Military Wives Choir
were led to the top of the charts by Gareth Malone. Bagging the
Christmas number one spot. He has turned his attention to this group
of workers from the Lewisham Healthcare Trust. They teased us at
the top of the show. But here they are, the newly discovered stars of
Gareth Malone's new telly series. If you want want blood, brackets
you got it!
Who is in favour of that? I've had a good idea.
Keep, bleeding, keep, keep bleeding
Any others?
So Gareth Malone, he lands in the Lewisham health trust and he gets
you all involved. How did he rope you? There was auditions and we
went ang long and he managed to    along and he managed to get the
talent down to 30 of us. I don't know how I did t but he did it.
Joe, you are an anaesthetist, when you are putting people to sleep,
are you singing to them? I don't use drugs anymore. I'm using song
based an theseia. Fame could come calling. Are you
ready to change the uniform for something spankly? I have resigned.
I am available for supermarket openingings.
You are a neo natal nurse, surely you sing nursery rhymes? Yes, I
sing other songs to the little babies.
How did you get involved? I heard about the audition. I heard about
the audition and my son said "mummy go for it. Since you are singing in
the house, you might as well go for it." I went for it and I was chosen.
Sarah, you did a concert in A&E? Yes, part of the process, we
performed opened the new A&E department and it was brilliant.
All our friends and family came. It was so funny. It was the first time
we performed to anybody. It was excellent. We were on such highs
afterwards. Well, you are a physiotherapist and
you are going to sing Lean On Me. Sometimes in our life we all have
pain, we all have sorrow But if we are wise, we know that
there's always tomorrow Just call on me brother when you
need a hand We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on Lean on me
When you're not strong, and I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on Oh, for
It won't be long Until I'm going to need
Ooh, somebody to lean on Lean on me.
Beautiful! Very, very big thank you
to the staff from Lewisham Health Care Trust and the Choir starts
tomorrow night at 9.00pm on BBC Two. Most musicians are waiting for that
big break, that killer hit. When it happened to one 0's band it tore
them apart. Carrie picks up the pieces and learns some lessons.
Isle of Wight, laid back and relaxed. A young group of musicians
used to play the pubs and clubs much. You could get to see them for
the price of a drink. By the 0's they became Level 42 playing
stadium gigs with Madonna and selling 30 million records. It was
a track called Lessons In Love that brought international superstar
status. It all began back on the island. The brothers and I met at a
party. I got the chance to join the band that they were in. The Isle of
Wight is a largely tourist based place. There were hotels you could
play in and pubs and holiday camps. There was loads of opportunity to
work as a working musician. Really learning your trade. Leaving the
island behind, the band started to take shape in London. Moving from
playing instrumental jazz funk to commercial pop. In 1986, following
their first Top 10 suck sets ses in America they were asked to produce
a hit single in advance of the next album. It had to be big. For me, I
just thought, OK. Let's do it then. Let's try and do that. We had
already sat down and made a decision, if we wanted to carry on
in the business. It was well doing 60,000 units of an album and stuff,
if we wanted to go to 600,000 every And that sequence, I'm sat there
and I hated playing that because I thought "I'm 15 and I shouldn't be
doing that." I couldn't get that idea out of my idea. The truth is
We'll meet again Don't know where, don't know
when... I'm not proud
I was wrong... The base featured really heavily on
that record? It's still one of the hardest lines to play. I have
played some hard lines. Holding that going, because it's relentless.
It never stops. I've been trying to reach your
shore... The band wrote a hit to order. It
worked. Selling many more than the desired 600,000 units, it was a
huge global success. Not everyone was happy. The Gould brothers felt
the track took the band in the wrong direction. Were they
struggling with the record and the sound of the record itself or with
success? A bit of both. I didn't know at the time that that was
going to be the highest point for the band but what would be the
architect of the band's downfall. It was so successful. Yet everybody
that was involved in making it happen really wanted to be...
Wanted it to be that way. Wan wanted to follow that route. You
either go with it or you don't go with it. I wanted to go with it. I
think it was the beginning of the end for the original line up of
Level 42. The Gould brothers both left the band. Despite a change in
line up Level 42 went on to have another dozen Top 40 hits. Now,
preparing for a new tour, Mark is reworking some of those hits
including Lessons In Love. If you you would have said it me when I
was nine or ten years old, do you want to be successful? I did. I
wanted to be in a band an be successful. I wanted to be on telly
and do all of those things. Here with a the perfect vehicle for. It
I'm really grateful to the song. Mark is with us now. You said that
was the beginning of the end, that song for the group. The orpbl line 
up? For the original line up, for sure. We had been together a number
of years. We had been enormously successful. The success and the
hard work you put into doing that it take as toll. You are back on
tour now with Mike? Yes. We have been working together for ten years.
He is such a great musician to play with anyway. Having more fun now
than back then, less pressure? There is no pressure. I don't need
to compete. I can swan about and keep my chickens on the island and
go back on the road. The young ones didn't develop the slap base a
combination of drumming and base playing? Yes, it is. It's... I
began as a drummer. For me the idea of using two hands to do something
as opposed to the usual (plays guitar) Oh, yeah! Yeah. Yeah!
good. Peel one of those off for you. As you brought your guitar we will
play this game. We have Carrie and Joe. We will place Ace of Base.
The whole idea is that Mark will play a little bit of the baa line
and you have to guess. I will look stupid here. It's like Name That
Tune. Grab a card and pen. You write down what song it is. That is
Joe looks confused, bless him! is too young. Before his time!
is too young. See this. Get Around. No. Joy Division. YES! It was Love
Will Tear Us Apart. Let's move on to the second one. Good luck with
Dadada... Oh, baby give me one more chance
Won't you be there Be back in my heart...
It's there. What is it called? Jackson Five   I Want You Back.
has Stevie Wonder. No. I've led a sheltered life. Jackson Five   I
Want You Back. We have run out of time. Before this week who would
have thought that our correspondents would have got so
competitive over giant veg and homemade jam. When the title of
Best in Show is at stake the gloves are off. Matt joins in the battle.
This is Caddington where they take their annual village show very
seriously. For one year only we have been challenged to enter the
cauldron like atmosphere of the Best in Show. There are 62 contests
ranging from cookery to horticulture. I have been entered
into the Best Cupcake competition. I think they have done this because
I know I ride a motorcycle and listen to ACDC and therefore I will
be rubbish and it will be funny. What they don't know is that I
absolutely love cake. I'm certainly not alone. We ate 65 million
cupcakes in the UK last year. They have their own week. It's safe to
say they're popular. It means the competition will be ferocious at
the Village Show. To win I need help. Step up cupcake Queen,
Jennifer Boulds. She will give me a few winning tips. I intend to win
with a carrot cupcake. I have never made one before. I have a recipe
here. It says "easy." That is good. I have the ingredients put into
bowls, like on telly. And, you know, how difficult can it be? Because
the cakes will partly be judged on taste, my recipe has orange zest
and mixed spices in to give it a bit of a kick. Time for a
masterclass and some encouraging words from Jennifer. This requires
all of my concentration. For you, you can do it blindfold. I could
make a monkey do it. But not me? It helps to someone who believes in
you. With the basic cake ingredients in, I am already
struggling. It's disturbing when you have only put your dry goods
together and you already have lumps. You can save cake at most stages.
The key is not to panic. Yes. Don't panic. I keep calm and crack on,
with the eggs! Look at. That what a beautiful mixture. Mix quicker.
Pour in quicker too. To my basic mixture of brown sugar, whole male
flower and eggs I add the carrot and a lot of. It I want my cakes to
look perfect. Jennifer has a top tip. I have to destride equaly.
Just for that. Like an ice cream scoop. You get a perfect portion
every time. An ice cream scoop for your cupcakes. Put them in the oven.
That is only half the challenge. Next is the topping. It should be
thick and creamy. I'm going for a mix of icing sugar, soft cheese and
butter. Oh, my God! No... No one... Just stay where you are. My
cupcakes have already been in the oven for 25 minutes. No one was
going to tell me. You weren't going to tell me. They are not that bad.
I mean, look underneath it's still moist and lovely. You could just
take the top off. Fill over the top and no one will know. Disaster
averted. Off comes the tops. On goes the icing. My confidence is
restored. No mention in the recipe of lime zest in my cream cheese
topping. It's how I'm feeling tonight. The icing creates a
moisture seal so my creations won't dry up. It needs a steady hand. I
think I've cleared the final hurdle. Which parts of my cupcake game do I
need to work on? You need to be more relaxed about. It stop being
so intense and pressurised. It's just cake. It's a start. What I
didn't realise until right now is that cupcake making is like
engineering with NASA like quality control. Unless I brush up my act,
I'm going to end up looking like a The pressure was on there! Andrew,
we know you like a bit of cooking, rumour of a main course or a
desert? Main courses. Fish pie. Killer fish pie. People think they
have eaten fish pie, they haven't eaten my fish pie.
A little bird told us you put anchovy in it? Anchovy paste, lots
of parsley, deadly! Very nice. I don't like anchovies.
You think you don't like them. Bring some in in tupper ware and
I'll try it. Keep it to fish and potatoes. You
can see Matt making more cup cupcakes on Friday when, he and
Mike and John Sergeant fin out if they have won. Matt is live in the
in the Watchdog studio. Thanks for dropping cakes off on the way past.
Somehow, they went home and never came out again! But wait until
Friday, it will knock your socks off. Matt, last week Ann asked for
The One Show viewers help for a BMW story. This week you want their
help? We want to hear from anyone who had a problem with animals they
bought from Pets At Home, we discovered some of their animals
were kept in shocking conditions. You will see the results later, but
if any One Show viewers have worries about animals they bought
from Pets At Home get in touch. And are you on the hunt for more
rogue traders? We are on the streets of Surrey with a company
whose salesman tried to scare old ladies into buying their over
priced alarm systems and boy, oh boy, do they not like it if you
Yeah, we didn't take too kindly to the way he was treating our beryl
so we sided to have a word with the wheelspin doctor there. You just
had Mark King from Level 42 on the show. I am going to enlist my 80s
pop legend to teach that salesman a lesson. Find out who at 8pm.
Pop back for Ace of Base later on! Don't eat any of Andrew Marr's
anchovies. Dring cakes.
   bring cakes. We are not sure about the fish pie.
Andrew, you have been drawing throughout the show.
I have. You have come up with something amazing. I haven't seen
You should be able to see it properly.
That's good. That is Matt and I.
Yeah.
Your garish set behind you, it is tastefully garish. Yeah. So there
we go, I will give that to you later on.
We have got quite a few of the pictures up there. That looks good
up there. That was the caves, amazing caves in South Africa where
we started the whole show. I was talking about 70,000 years ago and
they are they are sculpted into the amazing shapes by the wind. The
cleverest man in the world, chess master against IBM's computer, who
wins, the computer. A really important moment in our story.
That's an interesting story, a cold filming. I was shivering and that's
my fur hat at the bottom of the picture. And that's Kiev.
How long do they take? Shouldn't you have been filming? Well, they
mess around so much, that guy Neil Harvey who was phoning in. He was
playing around with his batteries and his camera! You have got to do
something to fill the time in and that's what I do.
Where is the most unusual place you drew? Most unusual place, I guess
we were on the steps of Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, living in a tent,
what they call a ger, there is no electricity or plumbing and it is
very rough indeed. Mongolian cuisine, there is a lot of fairly
rancid cows.
And sheep goo. Don't go for the cuisine.
They didn't have the anchovies. We have been asking for unusual
things you have been doing with your work colleagues. This is the
Bradford Chamber of Commerce on the Three Peaks Challenge. They raised
�7500. Well done to them.
This is the employees of scarp Scarp Of Thermo Fisher.
This is from Carol, it is an Andrew Marr self portrait.
One more. Lorraine and her colleagues at EDF cycled from
London to Paris over the weekend. Well done to them.
Well, it is 50 years since the birth of one of Britain's favourite
cars cars. Here is Alexei Sayle on the Ford
Cortina. My parents were communists and
communists always distrusted cars. For them, the only good car was
painted dark green and had armour on the side!
So all through my childhood, I grew up thinking that cars were these
rare, beautiful, exotic jewel like creations.
And there was one car that for working families was more exotic,
more jewel like than anything else, the ultimate motor for a dad and
his his lad, the Mark I Ford Cortina.
Codenamed the archbishop, the Cortina was launched 50 years ago
in 1962. And was for for for most of the following three decades
everywhere you looked on Britain's roads. The advertising promised
more car for your money and it delivered. But more than that, it
was classy. It was exotic and it was even named after an Italian ski
resort. We are at Cortina Italy, driving
the Ford Cortina. With stunts like this, bringing an
air of glamour to the car. The roads are becoming a best seller
was more prosaic. Harry Colton was the Cortina's
press officer. If you looked at a new car in the
show room, you were looking six to nine months delivery before you
could have your new car. With Cortina, all the dealers in Britain
had a stock of 30 motorcars for the day it went on sale and they knew
there was a constant supply following it. Suddenly for the
first time, there was a car that you could see and you could buy it
and you could drive away in it. Simple supply and demand, you might
think, but sales exploded making it Britain's best selling car from
1982 to 1991 and keen to snap them up was another new breed, the
travelling salesman. The success of a man's career symbolised by the
model of Cortina he drove and why did he want one? Because Ford had
made had sexy. Coopers chasing crims were bursting
through our screens in the 70s. It was a macho testosterone fuelled
time when women were considered a pretty accessory to the lifestyle
offered by the car. She doesn't care that the seats
have been designed with extra legroom in the front. She just
knows she is comfortable. But at the Dagenham plant, the
women workers were far from comfortable. Being paid less than
their male counterparts. We are on strike.
All of you? All the machinists anyway.
So no car car seat covers for Ford? Not from us anyway.
Walking out in 1968 for three weeks, it was a struggle that was
instrumental of bringing about the Equal Pay Act of 1970, but for the
Cortina, it was an early warning of trouble to come.
And as the the mark II became the Mark III, Dagenham factory was
under threat. In 1982 this mark V was the last Cortina off the
production line. Phil Lewis remembers the Dagenham plant in its
heyday. I worked for ford for over 30 years
and this was a car manufacturing plant. Of course, you come back now
and it doesn't make motorcars. I wouldn't really know where I am now.
For these die hard Cortina fans, it is time to return to their
spiritual home. Tell me with you are heading to?
Cortina. Where are you off to? Cortina. Where are you off to?
Cortina. They are off to the Italian ski
resort that inspired the dream. Phil, start up the archbishop.
It might only be 600 miles. But for these guys, it is a trip back in
Look at that. Arriving in style. Oh,
the brakes are a bit spongy, we're joined by loads of Cortina
enthusiasts. We have got Phil and Jenny.
General yip, can you let her    Jenny, can you let her out? That
was all right, Andrew. Phil and Jenny, what a momentous
journey. It is quite a long way to go in a car of that comfort level?
Well, it is not too bad, you know. You get numb after the first few
miles and you are so worried about the car keeping going, you don't
worry about things like discomfort, but it was more of an adventure
than a journey. Is that the same for you Jenny?
wants to go and I am not keen." But we did enjoy it.
How much time does he spend with his cars? Well, he is in the garage
a lot. It is essential to keep the
marriage going!
It was Eventful. Rod and Viv, tell us what happened on the way? Just
before we got into Cortina, my brakes failed on the hairpin bends
managed to stop it on the handbrake and pull over to the side of the
road and we bled the brakes and carried on. But it was a bit hairy.
Viv, how were you feeling? It was a bit worrying. A few more grey hairs.
You have lovely memories in your lovely white Cortina. What's your
happiest memory? Going on camping holidays with the children, Spain
and Portugal. It was our family car. Isn't it time Rod bought you a
sporty number? Well, I have got another car at home. Well, you are
Have a look at Andrew Marr!
Isn't that just fantastic. Lyn, well, you had a right time on
the way. Let us know what you did about half way along the journey?
My husband asked me to get into the car and take it on to the grid at
the Hockenheim ring and we kept going around the circuit. It was
brilliant. I loved it. I want to do it again.
Lyn Got in before you? The first time my car is on a racetrack and
she is driving. But I am going to buy her a day's driving at Brand's
Hatch for her birthday. We're going to jump into your car.
Alex, are you driving or do you me me to? You better drive.
This is brilliant. Right... OK, here we go.
