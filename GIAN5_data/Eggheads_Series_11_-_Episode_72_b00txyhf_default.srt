These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain.
Together, they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country.
Question is, can they be beaten?
Welcome to Eggheads, the show where a team of five quiz challengers
pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz team in Britain.
You might recognise them as they've won some of the country's toughest quiz shows. They are the Eggheads.
And taking on the awesome might of our quiz Goliaths today are Scrum Five.
apart from Dave, who's friends with team captain Colin. Let's meet them.
Shw mae. I'm Colin.
I'm 50 years of age, and I'm a trunk road and support manager.
Shw mae. I'm Mark. I'm 51, and I'm an IT facilities manager.
Shw mae. I'm Barry.
I'm 48 years old. I'm an electrician.
Shw mae. My name's Clive.
I'm 67 years old, and I'm a retired steelworker.
Shw mae. I'm David. I'm 48 years old, and I'm a general manager.
  You've got a clubhouse?
  Yes.
  You have a few beers there after a game?
  Yes. One or two, one or two.
And how do the team do?
All right.
Looking good for promotion this year.
Got a good side coming, a young side.
  Yeah.
  We've got Barry.
He's our first team guru.
  Coach? Manager?
  First team manager, yeah.
I was with youth for ten years.
Now they've promoted me to the first team, so...and it's our 125th anniversary this year.
Oh, congratulations!
That's a good anniversary. And you presumably played a bit in your time, did you, Barry?
I did play a little bit. Not to a great standard, but
yes, I did, yeah. We all played a bit.
And apart from the first team doing so well, you must put out an awful lot of teams,
  right down to the youngsters, I guess.
  Yeah, we got...
Well, the under eights is our youngest side now.
Do you have any quiz nights down the rugby club?
  Yeah. Sunday night.
  How do you do in that, then?
All right!
Dave, you're the odd one out. You don't like rugby!
  No, I do like rugby, but my game is more football or golf.
  Ah, I see.
OK. Well, brings something else to the party for that sport category.
If it does turn up, we'll see which one of you decides to play it.
Let's start the game, shall we?
And every day, there's £1,000 worth of cash up for grabs for all our challengers.
However, if they fail to defeat the Eggheads, the prize money rolls over to the next show.
So, Scrum 5, the Eggheads have won the last 13 games,
which means £14,000 says you can't beat the Eggheads!
And our first head to head turns up today as Geography.
Who'd like to start with Geography?
I'll fall on my sword.
Oh, straight in there!
OK, captain Colin there. Which Egghead would you like to play? Can be any of them.
Um, oh... Good question.
We'll have a go at Daphne.
Good question. There's no extra points for it!
Daphne to play Geography. OK, it's going to be Daphne and Colin.
Can I ask you both please to take your positions in the question room?
Colin, have you chosen to play Geography cos you know so much about the road network in South Wales?
Er, no, not really.
I've been swotting up on my geography, to be perfectly honest.
Um...mountain ranges,
anything beginning with A, as in Asia, I'm all right.
  That's about as far as I got!
  You didn't get through the rest of the alphabet.
You do work with the roads, don't you, the trunk roads in South Wales?
Yeah, I work for the Trunk Road Agency, which is...
affiliated with the Welsh Assembly Government.
We could have done with you a couple of games ago. Barry was wondering where the M4 ended up!
Think you might have been able to tell him.
I hope we'd've got that, or there'd be something wrong, wouldn't there?
Exactly! I thought there was something wrong with him!
OK, Colin, would you like to go first or second?
I'll go second.
Right, good luck to you, Colin, and first question to Daphne.
Daphne, in Scotland, what type of geographical feature is referred to by the term ben?
Well, I assume it's where Ben Nevis and Ben MacDui comes from,
so mountain?
It's the right answer, yes, mountain.
OK, Colin, your first question.
Algeria's coastline is on which body of water? It begins with A!
Algeria's in...it's African, isn't it? It's the Mediterranean.
You've come up with the Med and it's the right answer. Well done.
  Well done.
  Daphne.
Kimberly, famous for its open cast mine, known as the Big Hole, is located in which African country?
I think that's where they mine the diamonds, in...South Africa?
And they took all of a nano second coming up with a name for that!
The Big Hole, in South Africa, is the right answer.
OK, Colin, your second question.
What is the geological term for the well defined divisional plains that
separate one layer of sedimentary rock, marking a break in deposition?
This sedimentary rock, that would be, um...
That would be bedding, bedding planes, I'd've thought.
  Er...yes, I'll go for it. Bedding planes.
  B for bedding.
So you did have a look at the Bs as well, then, I guess.
  Yeah, I got that far!
  You got that far.
Bedding planes is the right answer. Yes, well done, Colin.
OK, Daphne.
Which US state is sandwiched between New York State and New Hampshire?
I hate these! I haven't got a visual picture of a map. Um...
I know I'm going to pick the wrong one.
Connecticut.
OK, Connecticut.
It is a tricky question,
  cos they're all kind of sandwiched together up there...
  I know.
  ..on the northeast seaboard.
  It's Maryland, isn't it?
  No, it's Vermont!
  Is it?
  Three goes to get it!
That's one I wouldn't have picked.
Well, I can tell! Right, well, Colin.
You go through if you get a right answer here.
Baron Haussmann is particularly associated with the rebuilding of which European capital?
Well, he's a baron, which, well, France...Belgium, Austria...
They're all baron types, aren't they?
I don't think they would've been... Well, rebuilding...
We've got to be talking about the war.
I don't think...there was much bombing of Vienna.
I think there's a lot of old Vienna still left.
I'm edging towards Paris, because obviously, that was bombed.
Um...
  Paris.
  Going for Paris?
You know what you've done, there, Colin?
You've got it right for the wrong reasons!
It's the right answer. It is Paris, but it survived pretty much
intact in the Second World War because it got taken so quickly.
When was the rebuilding of Paris by Baron Haussmann?
  I think the late 19th century.
  Yes. Middle to late 19th century.
Laid out all the boulevards and things, so the cavalry could ride down mobs.
They were frightened of revolution in France.
Well, it doesn't matter about the analysis. What matters is whether it went green or not, and it did.
It's the right answer there, Colin, which means you're through to the final round.
You've knocked Daphne out. Would you both please go back and join your teams?
Rugby players there getting over the line with their first drive. Scrum Five knocked an Egghead out there.
It's Daphne, she's gone. All of Scrum 5 still there.
And will it get better for them?
Our next subject is sport, which I'm sure you'd all like to play.
It can't be Colin. Any of the other four, sport?
Barry. Barry's having a go.
  Chris.
  Yeah?
  Chris.
Yeah. Well, the first one I met coming in was Chris,
so I'm going to have a go at Chris, please.
  OK. You bumped into Chris.
  Oh, you're joking!
  I didn't know you spoke Welsh, Chris!
  You'd be surprised what I can do!
  Absolutely.
A man of many talents. OK, is sport one of them, though?
Barry and Chris, into the question room, please.
So, Barry is team manager.
Does that mean you have to do just about everything that comes along,
arrange the fixtures and book the coach, whatever?
Yeah, pretty much general dogsbody.
Arrange the coaches, the times of training sessions, contact the players for availability.
  Yeah, pretty much everything.
  Wash the kit?
  No, that's my mother and father in law's job!
Glad to see you've drafted the family in there!
Now, do you want to go first or second, Barry?
Well, my instinct is always to go first, so I think I'll go first.
Right, the first question, Barry. Good luck.
What number is directly opposite the 20 on a standard dart board?
Not being much of a darter myself, although I do...
Have you got a board in the club?
We have indeed, but I don't get much near it.
We can't get past the bar, so... 20, I think is directly below...
I think it's 3. I'll go for 3.
OK. It's the right answer. Yes, well remembered.
Well done, Barry!
OK, Chris, what is the name of the most basic skiing term known as "the wedge"
in America, when the front tips of the skis are brought together and the tails pushed wide apart?
Sledge, snowplough, or snowshoe?
That's a snowplough, Dermot.
Yes, it is, Chris. Snowplough is correct.
Second question, Barry.
What colour strip do the invitation only rugby union team, the Barbarians, wear?
What colour strip do the invitation only rugby union team, the Barbarians, wear?
Well, my club wears black and yellow, so I know it's not that.
It's actually black and white.
Black and white. And of course, as proud Welshmen,
you will all remember that game way back in the '70s,
  that fabulous Barbarians game against the All Blacks.
'73, was it? At the old Arms Park, was it?
Yes, Gareth Edwards scored the try.
That was a try, what, from their own line?
  They just ran it all the way up.
  Started by Phil Bennett.
I'm sure you could name every player that touched the ball. Don't start!
Black and white is correct, well done.
It's the way those questions fall.
And how nicely did that one fall?
The dart board in the clubhouse, and then you got a Barbarians question there.
Right, Chris, what name is given to the race for the ball that starts a game of water polo?
Well, they start in the water, so it's not a dive in.
Swim off just doesn't sound right,
but duck down has a second symmetry about it, so I'll say duck down.
Yes, nice in duvets, but no good in water polo. It's swim off.
  Is it, indeed? Well.
  Swim off.
So, well, he's swimming off very soon, Barry, if you get this right.
Which batsman caused a sensation at the 2009 Welsh Twenty20
with his technique of dropping to one knee
and hitting the ball directly over his own ducked head?
My son's the cricketer in the house.
Not really good on cricket.
But he does go on about Dilshan
so my instinct tells me to go with my son. Dilshan.
Dilshan.
  Does he play at the club?
  He plays for the club, yeah.
On a Thursday night when he's home from university, yes.
Well, these questions really have fallen nicely for you.
That's from your son, that's the right answer.
You're in the final round as well, Barry, following Colin in there.
It means Chris is out. Would you both please come back and join your teams.
Two unanswered scores by Scrum 5.
They've knocked two Eggheads out.
None of their team have gone.
Can the Eggheads come up with a response?
What are they going to do here?
Next subject, it's arts and books.
Who wants to play this? Arts and books. Mark, Clive or Dave?
  Do you want to have a go?
  Yeah.
Chris and Daphne have played, so you have Barry, Pat or Judith.
I'll have a go at Pat.
OK, Pat, it's going to be. Let's have Mark and Pat into the question room, please.
So Mark, tell me about your writing career?
Well, Colin and myself started writing wedding speeches,
and we do poem type wedding speeches.
In fact, I've made a little one up today.
Good man! Let's hear it.
Well, anything can happen
Cos Scrum 5 are back in town.
But one thing is for certain
The Eggheads are going down!
It's like Muhammad Ali!
Colin and myself have been writing a few annual pantos.
  We'll get you a ticket, you can come along one day.
  Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not playing today, but we've got a panto actor, haven't we?
In CJ, every now and again.
We'd love to come along, wouldn't we?
At Christmas panto.
And I believe, Barry and Clive, you're taking part in it this year?
I'm not taking part in it,
I have been a narrator in the past, for my sins.
Because I'm not very good at learning lines.
And I've been a prompter as well, and it's a difficult job.
What about you, Clive? Have you dressed up for it?
If the part calls for it!
  What, the back end of a horse?
  Yes!
That kind of thing. Exactly.
All right then, Mark. Do you want to go first or second?
I'll go second, please.
It's you to kick off them, Pat. And its arts and books, just to remind you both. Your question.
Which word, now generally used for a comic drawing, originally meant
a full scale design for a tapestry or other work of art?
I think caricatures and lampoons are fairly specific,
slightly mocking drawings.
But Michelangelo and Leonardo and the like left behind lots of cartoons,
which where the preliminary line drawings for their bigger paintings.
So I think the answer is cartoon.
Cartoon is the right answer, Pat.
A full answer too, thank you, Pat.
And your first question then, Mark.
Who wrote the poem,
"I wish I'd looked after me teeth"
which was voted into the top 10 of a BBC survey
to find the UK's favourite comic poems?
Well, I have to say, I'm not sure.
I will have to have a shot in the dark, and I'll go for...
Spike Milligan.
OK. "I wish I'd looked after me teeth."
I suppose there's quite a few rugby players say that!
They get them knocked out.
It's by Pam Ayres.
Pam Ayres.
So Pat has the lead and a chance to extend it.
In 2003, which former American President published
a novel of the Revolutionary War entitled The Hornets Nest?
George W has retreated to his retirement,
he's not known as an author.
Bill Clinton has written his autobiography,
but the novel is by Jimmy Carter.
It's Jimmy Carter.
It is Jimmy Carter. The Hornets Nest.
So you are 2 0 up and you need to get this, Mark.
Velazquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X,
famously reworked by Francis Bacon,
is in the Doria Pamphili gallery, in which city?
Well, Dermot, that's a bit of a mouthful.
Again, I must say I don't know.
So I would have to go for Rome.
Rome. I suppose there's a Pope link there, and you're right! Well done.
Rome.
But, slipped up on your first one, so Pat can win the round if he gets this.
At the time she met and fell in love with Robert Browning,
the poet Elizabeth Barrett was living with her family
in which London street?
I think there's been a TV series, The Barretts of 'Blankety' Street.
I don't think it's Welbeck.
It's either Wimpole or Wigmore.
The Barretts of...
I'm just going to see whether I can recognise that sound.
The Barretts of Wigmore Street.
Wimpole.
I think I have a dim recollection of the Barretts of Wimpole Street.
So I'll go for Wimpole.
You can see how under the cosh the Eggheads are.
They're like jockeys trying to get a horse over the line here!
Come on, Pat, get it, get it!
  And he has!
  And Daphne says he has.
You have got the right answer, yes.
Wimpole Street.
Elizabeth Barrett lived with her family in Wimpole Street.
Which means you have won the round. Bad luck, Mark.
Good attempt. We'll never know what would have happened if you'd faced your third question.
You don't need to, you can't match Pat's score at the point you are now.
So it means you're not playing in the final round, Mark.
Would you both please come back and join your teams.
The Eggheads creeping back into it.
They've now knocked one member of Scrum 5 out. Of course, two of their Brains have gone.
And we reach our last head to head before the final round and this one is music.
Who'd like to play this, music?
It's Clive or Dave.
It's me.
OK, Dave. And two Eggheads remaining, Barry and Judith.
Yeah, we'll take on Barry in music.
OK, Barry. Dave and Barry in the question room.
  Dave, do you want to go first or second?
  I'll go first.
OK, good luck, Dave. First question is this.
What name is often used for eminent composers, conductors, or teachers of music?
I think I'll go with Maestro.
Maestro is the right answer. Well done.
OK, Barry.
Who had UK top five singles in the 1980s with, I Won't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, and Wouldn't It Be Good?
Hmm. I didn't listen to much pop music in the 1980s.
I don't think it's Blondie.
I'm just wondering if it's Wham or Nik Kershaw. Top five hits?
  Yeah.
  Against my instincts, I'm going to say Wham.
  It's the wrong answer.
  Ah!
  My instincts were right!
  What, Nik Kershaw?
  Yes.
  Yes, it's Nik Kershaw.
  Oh!
Well, a flying start for Dave. Second question.
Which rapper released the album, Year Of The Gentleman, in 2008?
I'm not too sure of this one. I'm not into rap, myself.
A little bit too old for that. Um,
I'll go with Ne Yo.
The only reason is that it sounds a little bit rappy.
OK, it's the right answer, too!
Thinking along the same lines. It's the right answer,
so two to you. Barry goes out if he doesn't get this.
The broadcaster Humphrey Littleton was an acclaimed figure in which genre of music?
He was a man of many talents and will be much missed,
but he was very well known in the jazz idiom.
So he was, yes. Jazz for Humphrey Littleton.
But you got one there but you've only got one on the board.
If Dave gets three with this one, you're out.
The songs Eternal Youth Is Worth A Little Suffering and Salome
are from which Andrew Lloyd Webber musical?
I wish my wife was here now,
she does tend to look at some of these musicals.
This is a wild guess, I'm going to go with Aspects Of Love.
Aspects Of Love for a place in the final round playing for £14,000...
You haven't booked it yet. That's incorrect. Daphne.
  I would have said Sunset Boulevard.
  Sunset Boulevard.
Yes, I always go straight for you for musicals, Daphne.
Sunset Boulevard.
OK, Barry, a chance for redemption.
You did this a couple of games ago.
And you need to get this. Which Benjamin Britten opera features at the famous Four Sea interludes?
Well, it certainly won't be Death In Venice.
But both Peter Grimes and Billy Budd have a nautical flavour.
Peter Grimes, I believe, is a fisherman who has a lot of bad luck.
And Billy Budd is set on board one of Her Majesty's warships.
On the principle that Billy Budd is more about the sea
than Peter Grimes, I shall go for Billy Budd.
And hope Daphne's not tearing her hair out.
She's not tearing her hair out
but she does look like she's just seen a rather nasty ghost.
Oh dear, it's Peter Grimes.
It's Peter Grimes!
And let's just savour that score for a moment or two.
Dave, it confirms you're through to the final round playing for £14,000.
Would you both please come back and join you teams?
So this is what we've been playing towards,
it's time for a final round   what a final round it promises to be,
which, as always, is general knowledge.
But I'm afraid those of you who lost your head to heads
won't be allowed to take part in this round.
So Mark from Scrum 5 and Daphne, Chris and Barry from the Eggheads, would you leave the studio, please?
So then, Colin, Barry, Clive and Dave, you're playing to win Scrum 5 £14,000.
Pat and Judith, you're playing for something which money can't buy   the Eggheads' reputation.
As usual, I'll ask each team questions in turn.
This time the questions are all general knowledge and you are allowed to confer.
Scrum 5, the question is, are you four brains better than the Eggheads' two?
Scrum 5, would you like to go first or second?
We'll put the pressure on, Dermot, hopefully. We'll go first.
First question, guys.
Which entrepreneur and reality TV star was appointed Enterprise Tsar in 2009?
Which entrepreneur and reality TV star was appointed
Enterprise Tsar in 2009?
We're all agreed on this, Dermot. Alan Sugar.
Alan Sugar is the right answer.
And you have got that good start. Up to you, Eggheads.
In Australian slang, what is referred to by the word "dunny"?
In Australian slang, what is referred to by the word "dunny"?
  It's lavatory.
  It's an external lavatory, isn't it?
Where deadly spiders live.
It's a lavatory.
Lavatory is the right answer. Well done, Eggheads.
Back to Scrum 5. Second question.
Which station was built as the terminus for Great Western Railway trains into London?
Which station was built as the terminus
for Great Western Railway trains into London?
Great Western   it's got to be Paddington.
It's got to be Paddington if it comes from the west.
We're working on a theory, Dermot.
Great Western,
which we came on yesterday, I suppose. Paddington.
Paddington?
Yep.
Where you go to if you're on your way to Twickenham as well, isn't it?
  That right.
  It's the right answer, yes, Paddington.
So, Eggheads,
in which country would you be most likely to stay
in a "riad", a traditional house with an interior garden?
In which country would you be most likely to stay in a "riad",
a traditional house with an interior garden?
I think it's Morocco.
It's an Arabic word.
  It's an Arabic word.
  Arabic for garden.
Yeah, well, there you are.
We are agreed that it's Morocco.
Morocco is the right answer, Eggheads. Two each.
Getting very interesting now.
Will this win the money for Scrum 5?
Which philosopher wrote, "Everything is gratuitous   this garden, this city and myself.
"When you suddenly realise it, it makes you feel sick and everything begins to drift.
"That's nausea."?
Which philosopher wrote,
"Everything is gratuitous   this garden, this city and myself.
"When you suddenly realise it, it makes you feel sick
"and everything begins to drift. That's nausea."?
Sartre.
Going for it?
Truth be known, Dermot, we don't know.
Is this the kind of thing you discuss over a pint after a game?
Not really, not really!
Well, I think the only one that jumps out at us that we know of...
..is Jean Paul Sartre.
So, are we...?
Yep.
Go on. Jean Paul Sartre.
It's the right answer. Jean Paul Sartre.
Well, Eggheads, you've got to get this.
Which artist best known for his black and white,
text based, scribbly, ink drawings started to produce cartoons for the Guardian in 2005?
  I don't know this.
  No, nor do I.
Do any of them catch the eye?
  No.
  They're all plausible.
Unless he's the son of Bridget Riley.
I suppose that's possible.
Do you want to go with Andy Riley?
  For no particular reason?
  Well, it's the only little thing we've got.
Well, we've nothing else, have we, to work on?
David Shrigley, Nick Bunnage, Andy Riley...
We're just going to have to pick one.
What d'you fancy?
I don't know.
  Andy Riley.
  Because it's the only...
  We've got no reason to pick him.
  Very tenuous.
  Very tenuous.
Well, we really don't know, and a very, very tenuous link
it might be Andy Riley as the son of Bridget Riley.
That's the only, it's a very tenuous link.
Bridget Riley being...?
An artist.
The artist who produces these text based scribbling drawings
in the Guardian is...
..David Shrigley!
Which means Scrum 5, you've won.
  And you didn't just win, you rolled them over.
  Easy.
if only the team could win so easily every week.
D'you know what, you only got two questions wrong in the entire game.
  Two questions wrong.
  It was all in the poem.
  Yes, that was it, the poem that Mark delivered, he's the only one that went out.
  Scared him.
But only two questions wrong.
The other interesting statistic, Eggheads, is that the last time you lost,
a certain couple of players were missing, Kevin and CJ!
But what a performance, Scrum 5, only two questions wrong.
You won those head to heads 3 1.
And you've taken that round, that final round 3 2. Fantastic stuff.
I'd like to be on that train out of Paddington with you.
Thank you very much for beating the Eggheads today.
You are officially cleverer than the Eggheads.
You've proved they can be beaten.
Join us next time to on Eggheads to see if a new team of challengers will be just as successful.
