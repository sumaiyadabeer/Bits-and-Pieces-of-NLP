Good morning. Let's get the weekend started with 90 minutes of mouth 
watering fooled. This is Saturday And twock the show. Cooking live in
the studio are two top chefs. The f. The woman who's wowing London with
a modern eastern Mediterranean menu she serves at her restaurant Quince
is Silvena Rowe. Next the chef in charge of one of the oldest
restaurants, Wiltons, been going for well over 250 years, but he
doesn't look a day over 35, Andrew Turner! Welcome to your both. A
different breakfast for you on the menu today? I decided to do
something dramatic and exciting, I'm cooking octopus with chorizo,
oregano and making a colourful salad, very wintry as well.
Different flowers in there? Yes, some listertion flowers, or you can
use any flowers, but edible only! Yes, that normally helps. The last
time you were here, you made mango egg. Anything equally fascinating
for us? I hope so. It's Jubilee week, I've created a poached Dover
sole with red wine. Fennel and apple salad. You are sandwiching
the sole together with something else? Yes, a protein meat glue,
I'll explain the process later on. Very interesting. We have got the
line up of classic foodie films from the BBC archive for you to
enjoy too. Selections from Rick Stein, Celebrity MasterChef and the
great man himself, Mr Keith Floyd. Now, when I found out which chefs
were on the show today, I thoughts I might need some extra muscle to
back me up in case things get ugly. Who better than the new kingpin in
Albert Square playing Derek braning, Jamie Foreman. This is fantastic
for me. Because it's free food? Absolutely, yes. Not BBC canteen
food any more? Me and my wife Julie are big fans of the show, we watch
every Saturday. It's a joy. haven't tasted anything yet?
octopus in the morning! At the end of the programme, it will be food
heaven or food hell for Jamie. Food heaven or food hell, it's up to the
viewers. Well, I will send the boys round if we don't get our way.
heaven? Crab, it has to be. That's one of mine as wellment Love it. I
go all over the country or the world, always looking for a good
fish restaurant, something new and different and I cook my own and buy
them live and cook them. Sounds good to me. Crab's good. What about
the dreaded food hell? I struggled because I love my food so much and
the poor girl Lucy who was phoning me up and asking me what my hell
was, western on the phone for an hour trying to work something out,
we came up with sushi, aubergine and risotto. I love rice, paela,
but I don't ever order it. Crab or risotto for Jamie. For heaven, I'll
use crab to fill my tortellini pass a that    pasta. It's served with a
pea and herb soup with sprigs of... This is a in brainer, how can you
go for risotto when you have seen that. Or Jamie could face food hell.
Classic courgette risotto with a twist. The rice is slowly cooked
with white wine and chicken stock, finished with mascarpone cheese.
Pan fried once cold and served with tomato ragu and deep fried
courgettes. Slaughtered me now, that looks lovely. Tortellini is
better, I'm not arguing with you! Let's meet the other guests. Two
Saturday Kitchen viewers, Joan, you wrote in, who have you got with
you? My daughter, Jennie. Both keen travellers. Crab, one of the places
you visited has one of the best crab dishs in the world, the
Singapore chilli crab. We lived there for a long time so any
visitor always wanted chilli crab with a bib on of course. Absolutely.
Gets a bit messy. Don't forget, you get to help decide what Jamie will
be eating at the end of the show. She's a very good cook by the way.
Surrounded by them. Nervous today! If you would like to comment on the
If you get on the show, we'll ask you whether Jamie should get food
heaven or hell. Heaven. Got to be the crab. But first you have got to
eat octopus. A woman whose incredible take on eastern
Mediterranean food is sending shock waves through the culinary world.
waves through the culinary world. She wrote that bit. That's right!
Dig the hair. Dig the suntan. Exactly. What are we making?
colour blind. Now octopus, it's a beautiful fish but Doesn't look it.
Eight little legs, boom, boom, boom, you know, basically it's so
beautiful and tender when it's done properly. I'm going to show the
method, the way to actually prepare it, any way you want it after that.
I always go for a frozen one. If it's fresh, freeze it because it
tenderises it. Sometimes if you get the fresh ones, they dry it out
don't they and leave it to air dry which tenderises it as well?
Because this is frozen, the suction is cleaned already and removed so
I'll get rid of the ice here and we throw this bit away. The other
thing we want to get rid of is this here. Off it comes. Now I'll give
it a bit of a beating, which would be right up your street there,
Jamie. You go, girl, you bash it. Want any help? The reason we do
that is it helps tenderise it. No need to go so far away! It's a
kitchen, you know. Yes. You could use a rolling pin for that,
couldn't you? Absolutely. A pan of hot water, very important,
three times dink in it, another thing you probably love doing in
your line of work, Jamie. OK, yes. One One, two, three. Normally
screaming by now. Lobsters don't scream. Vinegar and salt in helping
the tenderisation. While I wash my hands, the reason we do that is
because it will leave the tentacles beautifully and straight, it won't
curl up. Straight into the hot water, they then curl up and the
dish will look like nothing. So James while we are doing them, I
love the white pure flesh of the octopus with some chorizo and in a
way, this is very much a surf and turf dish. We have a hot pan. I'm
going to hop some onions. You want the segments here? This is what I
don't like doing. Even my commis would not do that. Segmenting an
orange, rights. You invited her. could sneak a little kiss doing
that. You are so British you know. Anyway,
tell us about your restaurant? going strong, there to stay.
Hopefully yes? Come on, Mayfair, Quince, hello, Jamie, you love the
Mayfair, no? I love it, yes. food is good, received very well.
It's very different what we do, so we already have some repeat custom
so it's good and we are there cooking all the time. Last night I
did dinner, one of my chefs was off sick so I had to do some work, can
you believe it, at my age, you know! This is too chunky but it
will go in, you know. You can't get the staff nowadays, what can I
say? Want some oil in here to stop it burning? Yes, I was hoping the
chorizo sauce was going to release its own oil there is, but we know
the love affair James has with oils and butter, don't we? Yes. Oregano.
It goes beautifully well. If you can't find it and why shouldn't you
be able to, you can use thyme and parsley. Can I ask you a question,
everyone says about oregano, the dried is as good as the fresh, I
don't think so. No, the only thing that is good dried as fresh is
tarragon. What do you think, James? I'm gist segmentling oranges!
Chorizo is cooking now for an hour. I don't have an hour, so we have
something we did earlier. The octopus. Do you cook a lot of
octopus, James? No. OK, so I'm sure...
If you would like to ask a question to us live later on. This recipe
will be on our website, along with all the other recipes.
What is happening? Beautifully milky soft as marshmallow.
doesn't taste like marshmallow though? No, the texture is like
that. Far too superior to squid and far more expensive and not so much
more expensive to buy but the treatment, you can see how easy and
simple it is and you shouldn't be frightened of it. So hopefully
people will go out there, buy some octopus... And it's already been
prepared, if you buy it frozen, it's already repaired? Exactly. But
the beauty is once it's like that, you can serve it as a cold salad
with herbs, I can add it to the one James is preparing. Kids party as
well, Pirates of the Caribbean? Exactly. I knew you would get into
the spirit of it eventually! What is going in there now? No, no,
no, can you please do the herb leaves for my salad. Come on, James,
we haven't got all day! As much as I would love to have all day with
James! She has got a heart. At this moment
in time, the producers is laughing in my ear, soon it will be a new
producer or it will be two years before you are on again. You can't
live without me. Herbs going in there. Just really
chop them. I prefer herbs to salad leaves. Mint, parsry? Yes, anything
you have, oregano as well    parsley. What about going to
America for a new cookery show? I have a new show. ABC, my dear.
Yes, it's all about time travel. Very, very exciting. We travel back
to different time zones and it's an ABC programme. 16 million people
are going to watch me. 60 million? 16! The projected figures, darling,
so if they love me half as much as they love you here, I'll do very
well. OK. Sounds exciting but I still have to look after the
restaurant so wait and see how we are going to work that magic.
Is anything else gone in there? Did he miss anything? No. The herbs
have gone in there and the oregano, yes. Orange segments, parsley, mint,
olive, sesame seeds. You want some oil. OK, what about my flowers,
James? Haven't put them in yet. Tell us about the flowers? I use a
lot of different flowers. These are pansies which are perfectly edible.
They look stunning, make the dish really sexy, appealing and
basically there's nothing in here, it's so fabulous for you. Off it
goes in here. And, like I said, you can use... You use a lot of sesame
don't you? I'm crazy about sesame. Black sesame, brown sesame and
obviously the variety here as well that we have. Yes. I think this is
pretty. What do you think? It will do for you? Yes. Good. Remind us
what that is again? Octopus, chorizo and oregano with orange,
olive and listertion salad. You can get the flowers from the
supermarket now, they've started to stock them.
They sell them, edible flowers. Very fancy. Straight for the
octopus. Octopus first time in the morning. Is it not milky and soft?
Milky, fantastic. With the chorizo it works well? Surf and turf.
will come down later. Happy with that. I know you are a keen cook,
would you ever attempt that? Absolutely. I think it's all out
there to try and to experiment. It's the preparation. It's shows
like this that encourage you to think I can do that. People are
afraid, they wouldn't know how the treat octopus. We sent our wine
expert Tim Atkin to the frosty Leicestershire this week to choose
something to go with Silvena's I'm in Market Harborough. I'm
heading to the shops to find some great wines for this week's dishes.
Silvena, the octopus and chorizo dish has a Spanish accent to it.
Because we have got meat and seafood in the same dish, you could
choose a Rose here, something like this 2010La Serrana. But I'm
thinking white for this dish, not pink. The wine comes from the Rioja
region, it's the Muga Sauvignon Blanc. It's overwhelmingly a red
wine region, Rioja, and the little white wine it does make can be
neutral. But when they are good, such like this barrel fermented one,
they can be really delicious. On the nose. Lots of pear and citrus.
A really nice vanilla spice. On palate, zesty acidity works nicely
with the octopus and the orange and salad. There's a smokyness from the
oak which works nicely with the paprika and chorizo. A herbal
undertone picks up on the spring onion. I promised you a Spanish
wine to go with your recipe and I've stuck to my word. A bargain,
just under �9? Tim always gets my food beautifully. Tim knows my food
and this is gorgeous. Absolutely the way it goes with it is fabulous.
Vanilla tones, slightly Herbie, fabulous with the pepper and the
flowers as well. Lovely aroma. Stunning. Fresh. The girls look
happy as well? Very. That is gorgeous and the floweriness of the
bow Question Time of the wine! happy. Andrew will be experblting
with glue later on. What will you be doing    experimenting. Dover
sole and fennel. Rick Stein is coming up now. One of my favourites,
yes. Thank you very much for that, yeah!
The soft Gulf Stream air of west fantastic early vegetables,
You know, you hardly ever find spring greens in restaurants.
It's a pity. Maybe it's because they are something we take for granted, like the Cornish pasty.
Well, I think a pasty is fantastic food.
I have come to the Lizard to see Ann Muller, a great ambassador for them.
She got upset when an eminent American food writer called William Grimes
said how awful Cornish food was.
He was ready to pronounce a curse on the pasty. This from the people who brought us cheeseburgers!
He said, "The worst food per square mile in the civilised world was probably found in Cornwall."
And that the pasty could perhapsbe used...the only use for the pasty  would be "as a doorstop."
The thing that impressed me about Ann's pasties was first of all the quality of those local vegetables.
She seasoned every stage. And the steak was chuck steak. Then she put  on that a bit more seasoning.
Then the onions and the potatoes and a bit more seasoning. And everything was carefully layered.
I have never seen so much attention  to detail in the making of a pasty.
And, of course, Ann has made so many pasties that the crimp was like lightning and so deft!
As she made them, she was talking about the little nuances, like how her mother's differed from hers,
the ones from Devon were different from the ones from Cornwall, some had carrots, some didn't.
And I was left thinking how little William Grimes understood about this great local food.
It's not credible to people.
A lot of TV chefs cook the ingredients first, or they put extra seasonings in,
because they don't find it credible that these simple vegetables, grown in Britain, grown locally,
can be assembled and seasonedand produce such a wonderful flavour.
Swedes, onions, potatoes and beef, that's it.
Don't think, because much of this programme is about meat and vegetables,
that I have stopped being wildly enthusiastic about fish.
I am excited to be going out with David Muirhead today, hand lining for mackerel just off St Mawes.
Hand lining is so conservation friendly.
In an age of giant trawlers scooping fish out of the sea,
we all ought to applaud, as does the Marine Stewardship Council,
such relatively inefficient but long term, sustainable methods of catching fish.
I was just thinking about all these  lovely line caught mackerel from a restaurateur's point of view.
We have been through nouvelle cuisine,
we've scoured the world for flavours   lemon grass, chilli,  Pacific rim, fusion, you name it!
But what we are all getting back to  now is just basic, good ingredients.
Something like this to have on my menu,
and Marine Stewardship accredited, is something to be really proud of,  I think.
I remember in the '70s,
vast trawlers were allowed to come here and hoover up virtually all the inshore mackerel.
Even at the time, I thought, "What a waste! Beautiful fish turned into fishmeal."
Well, they described our way of catching fish as the stone age fishery.
But stone age fisheries are very sustainable
and, compared with the way the Scots  catch them, relatively inefficient.
And I think, "Why knock it?"
If you can earn a living in a relatively inefficient way, then your stock will last for ever.
But if you are going to fish in a very, very, very efficient way
and not control it properly,then you will overfish the stocks.
Is
I picked up this idea in Italy.
If you eat oily fish like mackerel or herring and then bite into a sharp onion... Wow! Interesting.
..it works a treat. Well, the way I do them, which isdead easy, absolutely dead simple...
Yeah? Boil up some water or get it nearly to boiling, just below boiling,
Yeah? Boil up some water or get it nearly to boiling, just below boiling,
whack a bit of vinegar in, the whole mackerel in, obviously headed and tailed and gutted...
The whole mackerel in, and then bring it to the boil,literally boil it for two minutes,
then let it cool in the water and...  and when it's cool take it out.
I think... Well, you'rethe master chef. See what you think.
Mmm! It's lovely and moist.
That's one advantage of it.
Brilliant! It works a treat, that. And the mackerel's not bad either. The mackerel's brilliant.
Perfectly cooked. Excuse me for talking with my mouth full.
Well, you are the expert, but I think the problem isa lot of people overcook the fish.
Hand line caught mackerel.
You know, in France now, in posh restaurants,
they are actually putting certified  hand line caught fish on the menu.
So it just shows you how much better hand line fish are.
I am going to make an Indian masala  to go with these mackerel here.
I am slashing them down to the bone,
so I can dig that masala right into the flesh of the fish to flavour them well.
Now for the masala.
First of all, some peppercorns and quite a few cloves.
Those are the only spices I am going to use in my masala. Masala just means a curry paste.
I soaked red chillies in water for about an hour
and add some garlic and ginger, vinegar, brown sugar, salt and the soaking liquor from the chillies.
I whiz it up for about five or ten seconds and then it's ready to spread over the mackerel.
I work the paste into the cuts of the mackerel and also into the gut cavity.
Into the pan they go... First one.
Then the other.
And I am going to cook them for about four...five...six... six minutes on either side now.
You know, whatever fish I cook with curry, with masala, the sort of vibrant aromatic spicy sauces,
somebody is going to write to me and say it's a total travesty,
you should never partner good, fresh fish with so much flavour.
And if we were talking about turbot, I think they would have a point.
But something like mackerel, it just works so well.
It's something about their oiliness. And they are a robustly flavoured fish that works a treat with curry.
While the mackerel are cooking, I am just going to make what is sometimes called a fresh chutney.
I have some red onions which I have thinly sliced.
I'm going to put a tiny bit of salt  in with them right now. This needs to be done at the very last minute.
Then I add some ground coriander and some cayenne pepper
and quite a lot of lime juice   the juice of one lime for a relatively small salad  
and a big handful of very roughly chopped coriander, and that's the whole salad.
Check the mackerel.
It's looking exceptionally tasty.
Put that on the plate like that...
And now...
a nice pile of my fresh chutney.
And...I've just cut some limes that... Like they do in India! And there we go.
Is is
Is is Rick's
Is is Rick's mackerel
Is is Rick's mackerel looked delicious. Last week, I showed you
how to fillet mackerel. This week it's a little different. You've
been writing in to ask how to make stocks, particularly a brown stock.
This is a classic beef stock. The way you do this, and I'm going to
serve it with another classic dish, but classic beef stock starts off
but classic beef stock starts off with brown in the bones first of
all. In this tray, we have some veal or beef bones which you can
get from the butchers. But this is the way that you do it properly. So
I'm going to show you, this is a quick way. Brown them off, then the
veg. In this pot which is a small stock pot, in the restaurants we do
1,000 litres of water in one two, so you need to brown the onions.
I've left the skin on for this, purely for colour, it adds flavour
too, but mainly for colour. If you brown it at this stage, you will
end up with a brown sauce at the end. Brown off the bones, straight
in the pan as well. In there, I've got carrots, leeks, celery and
onions, the traditional Fab Four, as they're called really. Then they
go in. We've got some tomato puree. That can go in as well. You always
put this in at the beginning of a cook cooking. Always in at the
start. Parsley, red wine. You wanted to know how to make it
properly! Mind the fumes! Waft them this way, I don't mind! Just a
small amount, two bottles frpbgs good quality red wine. Water.
Masses and masses of water. One thing you do need with brown stock
particularly is thyme and it's not the herb, it's basically your time!
You heat this up, bring it to the boil and gently simmer this for 48 
hours traditionally. 48 Hours, just keep skimming the top, a gentle
simmer, train it off and then reduce it down. This is where the
sauces come from, this is how to make good quality sources, it's
about the reduction of the liquor. You have the stock there. However,
you can go the supermarket and buy some already done. Cheap. But this
stock you can still use. I'll show you how to start off the sauce, to
turn it into a red wine or Madeira sauce which we'd use for this
Rossini. Start off with the shallot, in the pan, the pan is hot as
anything, as hot as it will possibly go. That's full on. Just
lightly brown these and I've got some more red wine, Madeira and
then this reduced stock. Now, literally looking at a pot like
that, that will make about half a litre of finished sauce. So you
start off big and end up very small. That's where the expensive part of
the eating comes from because it's basically this sauce and the time
it takes. Red wine in. Madeira. Reduce this down. It's all about
adding sauce, reduction. Flame disappears, we add the stock and
reduce that for five minutes. That's nearly ready for the
finished sauce. With this Rossini, whole fillet of beef. Look at that!
Three main cuts. The bit at the end is used ford strognauf, the middle
bit for fillet stakes, this bit about �60 or �80, posh tea.    used
for stroganoff. We'll pan fry that all the while the sauce is going.
You were disparaging about the small fillet there I thought.
it home! It's still great to use but you would use it for a
stroganoff, rather than use the prime bit, you would use the end
for that. Unless you had some of this glue where you could stick it
together, but that would be cheating. The fillets have gone in
there first of all. A little bit of butter on there first of all.
That's not enough for you, you always put more in. How do you make
your    like your stake? Medium rare. Congratulations on EastEnders.
You've done so many different TV things? 40 films, James, man and
boy! When you do something like EastEnders, nobody recognises you
in the films then. You go nuts. it something you have wanted to do?
They asked me before and I didn't feel like I could commit and I was
doing a lot of films, but you get opened up to a whole new audience
and keep growing and developing. That's what life's all about. So I
thought it was the perfect time to do it. Is that what you think, you
continue learning? Yes, you learn something new every day and you
have to go there with that open mind. You take something else on
board. That's how you develop and grow as an actor, so that's good.
Enough of me anyway, I've got a book coming out in March, I'm
working on a film, EastEnders I'm loving. Got another movie coming
out... Tell us about the film? You are a writer as well? And a
producer and I put the project together, it's a Labour of Love
about me and the '60s and the men I grew up with, for good or bad.
Colourful characters? Very. And a wonderful, strong, beautiful mother.
Morning mumsy. So I wanted to tell it from my perspective from a young
boy growing up in that world and it's been a Labour of Love for me
and we put it on hold while I came in to do EastEnders which has been
fantastic so I'll go back to that as soon as I come out of EastEnders.
Brilliant. Look forward to that. This is the spinach. You want to
know about the food? Yes, always! The spinach, salt and pepper,
basically show tit heat of the pan is all. Most times when you put it
in a bit of water, it never blanchs. It just goes away. Takes away all
the flavour. Got the beef there. In olive oil and a touch of butter.
Then because you like a little bit... Good man. Throw that in the
oven. With filament stake, a lot of people want to pan fry it all the
way through but you can flash it in the oven and treat it like a
roasting joint. The stock here, reduce, reduce, reduce. Lovely.
Strain it off through a sieve. You can put that through a little tea
towel or muslin cloth, something like that. Then to finish this off,
bring it down again. This is where you have got to get it right
because you add some butter. If it's too liquidy, the butter will
separate, if it's too solid, it's no good. Do you get that bit of oil
on the top? Yes that's what you want. We are adding butter to
finish off a sauce and it thickens it but gives it a glaze as well.
Then we grab our spinach so the beef is in the oven so we lift this
off like that. So we are going to see the character then in the
kitchen on EastEnders? Actually, yes, we discusseded this yesterday.
Really? Yes, absolutely. I said about in cooking because he's a
passionate man, Derek, you know, he's tough, rough and nasty, but
you don't get that without being passionate and he has a thirst for
everything, so cooking, absolutely. Are those kind of characters those
very loud characters as well, the bad guys, are they easier to play?
No, no. Nothing's easy to play, James, if you want to do it to the
best of your ability. They're more difficult in a lot of ways because
you don't want to make them a caricature bad guy because you have
got nowhere to go with him, you have to keep him open and moving,
you know. If you constantly walk around growling at people, people
will get bored of you. Kick them around the kitchen? Absolutely, yes.
Look at that stake, look. Beautiful! Glaze the stakes.
smells coming up with just fantastic. The sauce is coming down.
The marrow from the bones. Exactly. This is just about there and now we
can pop in the butter. What this will do is just give the sauce a
shine. If I turn that off the heat and keep shaking it like that, it
starts to get this lovely shine on it. It's the shine that we want for
this dish. Traditionally, it would have something else on it but you
have got duck liver pate. You are going cheap on me! No, foie gras,
you can use it if you want but I like to use this, they use that in
France, foie gras. Put a bit of sugar in this to finish it off. As
soon as it hits the plate, this is what makes it a restaurant quality
sauce because you have reduced it down. Not finished there yet Jamie,
hold on a minute! Because, Rossini, named after the composer, would
always have black truffle. course. Wow. Wow, wow. Shaved black
truffle. Unfortunately, at if t end of the show, there's no more budget
left, but that's it, try that. look! That's the art of making a
rich sauce. When you start off with a pan this size full of liquid at
the beginning, you are probably going to end up with a pan this
size when it reduces down, so think of all that wine and water you put
in and it's all about the reduction and the reduction makes that.
is going to be real hot. I'm a real wuss when it comes to heat. Oooh!
If you have a cooking skill you would like me to demonstrate on the
show or you have a tip to share with us, drop us a line. You can
contact us via the website. You are not going to get any of this! What
will Jamie be facing at the end of the show, food heaven or food hell?
Tortellini with pea and herb soup. Jamie could face food hell, the
risotto, the rice cooked with white wine, chicken stock, mascarpone,
chopped cheese and courgettes, cool and served with tomato ragu and
deep fried courgettes. Some of the viewers get to decide Jamie's fate
today. Are you going to go for the tortellini, are you? Yes, give him
what he needs, I like the noise he makes when he eats. And Joan?
tortellini. Don't let me down! Michelle, Linda and Nick have one
last chance to impress, they have to cook a three course meal for
three fearsome judges from the Ladies and gentlemen, everything
comes down to these three courses now.
Served up to three formidable cookery judges from the WI.
Let's cook! The contestants have just one hour and 45 minutes to
cook a three course meal of their own design.
Today's three diners are all prominent cookery judges from the
Women's Institute. Amy Walcock is one of the national
cookery judges. Ruth Bond is the chair of the WI. And Jill Brand is
one of the WI's top authors. Throughout the competition,
entrepreneur Michelle has struggled. Overcooked tomatoes, undercooked
vegetables, it's not very good. certain dishes have shown promise.
It looks like a dish that should come out of a restaurant. Big day
today. Very big. What are you cooking to secure your place in the
competition? Scottish smoked salmon with tiger prawns in a seafood ragu
with cucumber. Main course? Scottish lamb, posted parsnips,
potato fondant and a rosemary dew. Dessert? Chocolate fondant and
cream and warm chocolate sauce. Half hour already gone. So far some
of Linda's dishes have had strange combinations. Never before in my
life have I had spaghetti, toast and mash potato all together.
Neither have I! But in between the chaos, there's been real skill.
That dar! Is that a good one? such thing as a bad ta dah. Tell us
your three course? Linguine request mass core pony and mushrooms, then
stuffed sardines with pinenuts and anchovies on my favourite mash
potato and carrots, followed by lemon possit and biscuits for the
side. Right from the start, Hollyoaks
star Nick has shown great potential. Crispy outside, soft on the inside,
those are very good. But at times, he makes silly mistakes. It is like
eating raw cake mix. What are the three courses Herb roasted scallops
with pea and lemon risotto and rack of lamb with chantennay carrots and
a dew. Dessert? Strawberry dish. First to
face the critics is Michelle. Still got a lot to do. The parsnips
are there, she's got 15 minutes to get those, the lamb's in the oven,
the spnaich and mus room sauce hasn't been started. There's the
chocolate fondant.    spinach and mushroom sauce. Michelle's starter
is a ragu of tiger prawns, smoked salmon and cucumber.
Presentation could have been done in a more dainty manner I think.
think it's all overcooked. Very tough and the prawn is definitely
chewy. What are you going to do? What do you mean? 15 minutes, no
parsnips, sauce not start and you haven't started the fondant? I
think you have got to make a decision because you have 15
minutes to go. You can't carry on regardless. Man, why hasn't all
gone so wrong? I'm raging, raging, practising them until 4 clock this
morning. Your chocolate fondant? don't know. They should be out now.
Oh, really? Really, yes. OK. I've Let's go. Finish the other two and
let's go. Yeah, done? Is that it? Good, well done, you. Don't run
Smile. Thank you. This is Scottish rack of lamb with potato fondant,
rosemary dew and my cranberries that have been soaked. You can
really smell the rosemary. But, I can't see any parsnips. Can you?
The flavour of the meat is very good. I'm concerned about the fat
on the meat hasn't been rendered. It's almost raw, the fat.
potato is not adequately cooked. Should have been creamier. Michelle.
You're five minutes late on the desserts, they are not in the oven,
you are going to be 20 minutes late once you get them cooked so the
least you can do is tell the ladies you are going to be 20 minutes late.
OK, yes. So sorry. I'm going to be 20 minutes late. 20? 20. That's
Michelle, look, you've gone 25 minutes over. I kind of need to
know how long you are going to be? Not long, honest. How long?
minutes. So you will end up being All right! Happy? Really have to go
Chocolate fondant. Michelle's deszrt is warm chocolate fondant
with chocolate sauce and chantilly cream    dessert. That looks really
good. Well, mine was a proper fondant. It oozed beautifully,
tasted delicious and the cream with it is just spot on I think. I think
the flavour is excellent. Yes, we did have to wait but I think she's
You can see how Nick and Linda fare serving up the three meals and see
which of the three get knocked out in 20 minutes. Still to come, our
Saturday minute live. Keith Floyd's gone up north in the middle of the
Northumberland fells cooking a Roman inspired recipe in the
pouring rain for a local historian. Classic stuff.
It may have been Charles Dickens 200th birthday but don't have any
great expectations! Oh, no! Wicked! Can our celebrity chefs will go
head to head. What will we be cooking for Jamie? Tortellini.
room left after the stake? Yes. Risotto for hell or crab for heaven.
Andrew, tortellini? It's a no bringer, tortellini. Yeah, look at
that, clean sweep. Cooking next is man who last time
was on made a mango egg using a bunch of stuff from a chemistry
cupboard. This weeks meat glue on the menu! Welcome to the show
the menu! Welcome to the show Andrew Turner. Meat glue, we'll get
on to that but it will be used to stick the fish together. What the
the name of it? We are doing a sole Jubilee, Diamond Jubilee as it's
Diamond Jubilee week, with apple and fennel salad, and sauce. We'll
get that one cooking now. In we go. You want me to do the sauce? If you
can get the shallots, the mushrooms, the bow Question Time garni. The
fennel head with dill. Fish stock?Nd   and meat stock. That can
all go in together. Brixham sole fresh great British product. Ask
the fishmonger to double fillet it for you. Which is taking it out in
one piece on the top. And ask for the waste which is what will make
the sauce. Remove the sole. A bit of butter. Chop the Bonns up as
well. Fish stock is opposite to the meat stock. Cooked that for 20
minutes, no more really for the fish. 20 minutes. Don't boil it.
Bit of white wine. Tell us about Wiltons because there is a
fascinating history with it? It's been around since 1742 iconic
restaurant, real classics from lobster and crab and game when it's
in season. You specialise in oysters, don't you? Yes, it's a
signature dish really, of course. You can't get betzer oysters than
at Wiltons, I have to say    better. You would say that but there you go.
I'm just wheeling to get in there one night. It's a deal. The double
filleted sole, have some ham or pancetta to lie down the centre.
The meat glue again is important. It's a product do, not inhale it!
Be very careful what you do with it, treat it with caution and a little
bit down the sides of the fish. This will actually stick the fish
together, glue it together. You can get this on the Internet? Yes.
this is like a protein isn't it? Yes, it's the enzymes that will
form the protein to stick together. You place the outside fillet on the
outside, so presentation side out. Like that. OK. We literally trim it
up so it's nice and neat. Again, trimmings in the sauce, lovely.
waste? No waste. Everything in cooking is about using the waste
that you have. I don't like to put anything in the bin really. It's
all about the money, we have to be careful. There's your sole fillet.
Glued together. This glue will work? It will work? Yes, at
Christmas time, you can have a turkey leg, ask the butcher to bone
it, suchling down the centre, roll it tight in cling film, let it set
overnight and when you carve it, it will remain perfectly rounded,
won't split open on you. Does it taste of anything? Not at all. They
say the Japanese invented it, but I have a feeling it might be the
Danish. Frpblgts top that in the fridge for four hours. To leave it
to set? Yes. You want me to turn that over? I'll flip it over.
did this cling film thing come from? It's always intrigued me, you
now seem to hear a lot about it? It's a useful product without doubt
for preserving things as well. For me, I'm cooking and I don't want
the water to come into contact with it. The sole is just good on its
own. Salad here. Batons of apple. Fine little batons. The fennel in
there as well. Fennel pollen with that. I don't think my wife Julie
will be doing this, she lates fennel, that's her hell. Celery
will work very well. Celery salt. You are going to serve this with
this stuff? Yes. When you are preparing this, gloves on, give it
a really good wash. When you fry this, it will go rock hard. It's
quite soft. Put that in the ban like this. You normally peel them
and put them in? It's all towards the lemon juice water. They call
them oyster things? I love that product, it's one of the vegetables
that I think is versatile and it's tasty. Very seasonal as well. Just
coming out of season now but it's still just about in. Explain to us
the sauce. That's what we started off with, this is what we end up
with? Yes, reduced down, pass that off. It's gone dark because of the
port and the meat dew in in as well? Yes, great consistency. A bit
of heat under that. The salsify you are going to brown off? Yes. Makes
great soup? Never tryed that but that would be fantastic. You can
fennel tops, dill, fennel and the little apple. Vinaigrette, best
olive oil and you are going to have a very good vinaigrette. That goes
in there. Six minutes on that fish so it can probably come out now.
You are just going to colour these, yes? Yes. Again check the fish is
cooked, probe the centre of it or prod with a fork and if it's warm 
to hot on your lip, it's ready to go. Do you still look at the
classics like the Rossini? Without a doubt. Rossinis and soles,
anything like that. Classic food. We also have the tasting menus.
This is the sort of food I used to do that I brought the Wiltons that
gives that 100 roundship of what you can eat at Wiltons, it's not
just the classics. That's done. This fush is out so I'll leave you
to check that    fish. great thing about the salsify, they
don't need to be lemon juiced again. Because they contain everything.
Doesn't take very long. Again if in work I would keep that in a vacuum
bag. People haven't got that at home you see, Hoover bags though,
but not vacuum bags! How did you do that vegetable there, that root
vegetable 1234 Cooked in salted water, a bit of lemon until it's
tender, take it out and pan fry to clarify the butter or olive oil if
you prefer. OK. This is ready now. stuck it together. You have got the
ham in the centre there. What a lovely combination. Looks great.
Doesn't it just. Here we go again! Lovely! Easy show this, isn't it?
Loving it here, can I come every week? This stuff, we have not used
this before on Saturday Kitchen? it's caviar oil, named after me,
it's Turner's caviar oil and I've literally... Ie How sexy is that to
have an oil named after you. I want one named after me.
I want an oil named after me, get a life! What is that again? It's
Dover sole, silver Jubilee. Well Dover sole, silver Jubilee. Well
done, brilliant. There you go. Dive into that. Can I try first?
wait your turn! Look at that! us what you think of that one?
Salsify, have you ever heard of that or tried that? No. It's a
little bit under for me if I might say. Oh, that's lovely. Beautiful
Dover sole. Yes. Probably needed another minute to be honest. Pch 
that oil's interesting because it has a salty taste. Asparagusy
textures, like the Spanish ones. The white ones? Yes. Now to Market
Harborough to see what Andrew chose Your Diamond Jubilee sole dish is
all about celebration. I'm keen to find something that will match it
to perfection. For a wine matcher, it's a difficult dish because we
have the pancetta, port wine and fennel and apple. The wine has to
combine acidity with sweetness, something maybe like this Riesling.
Something better and off the wall is the 2010 La Couronne des
Plantagenets Vouvray. The variety behind vouf ray is one of the
world's greatest grapes    Vouvray. It comes in a bewildering multitude
of styles from dry to sweet, still to sparkling.
This one's off dry and it's perfect with fish dishes like this. On the
nose   floral and lovely touches of apple and honey. On the palate  
sweetness works with the shallots, the port wine sauce too. The
acidity is perfect with the apples and salty pancetta and a herbal
undertone picks up on the dill and fennel. Plenty of flavour here and
it's subtle enough to partner the sole. There's even a Royal
connection here in the name. Happy with the wine choice? Yes, really
fruity, not sure if it's my perfect pairing but it's difficult with all
the flavours. A lot is going on. This doesn't work for me at all,
I'm afraid. I don't like sweet wine. I quite like that one. A lot of
flavours going on there so it's difficult. A good German one.
a very complex dish, I would have gone for something lighter not to
compete with the flavours. joufr powering. I kind of the like
it but I'm a girl I suppose. It's fruity and light. If it's more
complex, it would have been mind blowing with the flavour. You have
got the oil, the salsify, the sauce. With the meat running through the
centre because it's glue and cooked slowly, it sometimes looks
translieu isn't but the fish is cooked all the way through, it just
looks like that. Back to Celebrity MasterChef where Linda is about to
serve her three courses to the judges of the WI.
You've got five minutes Come on, come on! It's going cold
Linda's starter is linguine with Well, this looks very interesting.
There isn't nearly enough seasoning in this.
Presentation was good, there's no doubt about that.
But the lack of mushrooms doesn't add to it.
Let's get this main up. You've got two minutes to get it out.
Come on, Linda.
What's got to go on the plate? Carrots... That's it.
Great. Let's go. Well done. Well done.
There you go. Thank you.
For her main, Linda has made fresh sardines
with pine nuts, raisins and anchovies on a bed of mash
with carrots.
I have to say this reminds me of my mum's portions.
But HUGE! And bearing in mind we've had pasta to start with,
I mean, there's no way that one could finish this.
If it was just a smaller portion of potatoes,
we'd have been much more positive because the flavours are very good.
Is it set? It looks like it is, yeah.
Shall I go? Well, if you're ready. Yeah.
I'm a little slower with this one. Oh!
It's a long way!
Thank you. Oh, that looks pretty.
Linda's dessert is a lemon posset with fresh berries
and shortbread biscuits.
The posset isn't set.
You can see how runny it is. It needs longer in the fridge.
But the flavour's good. Nice, sharp lemon flavour and very pleasing to the eye.
Biscuits need to be crisper, but they look very good, don't they?
Biscuits need to be crisper, but they look very good, don't they?
Last to face the cookery judges is Nick.
Nick, ten minutes for your first course.
If those scallops are cooked well, mate, you're on to a winner.
Cooked OK? Soft, no crunch in the rice? Good.
Can we go with this? Yep. Let's do it.
Give them a big smile, mate.
Good afternoon, ladies. Hello. Are you all right?
There you go. Thank you.
Nick's starter is herb roasted scallops
with sweet pea and lemon risotto.
The scallops are done to perfection.  Well, at least two of the three that I've tried are.
The flavour of the rice is lovely.
I don't think the risotto is very well cooked.
I think the rice is very stodgy. It's not creamy, as it should be.
I'm afraid I don't agree with you. I think it's lovely.
How's that lamb? Overdone, to be honest.
Getting flustered and you're making mistakes. Calm down. That's it.
You've got about three minutes left, Nick, please.
Let's go!
Oh, my God!
Here you go, ladies.
Nick's main is roast rack of lamb,
dauphinoise potatoes, Chantenay carrots
and a blackberry jus.
This has got real eye appeal. It's really lovely.
The lamb   one is more well cooked than the other.
I would have liked it a bit less pink.
The potatoes are cooked and the cream hasn't separated out.
So that's really good. And thecarrots are really lovely carrots.
They look all right, Nick.
Whey!
Go! Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Hi, ladies. Are you all right?
Sorry, I'm in such a tiz.
There you go.
For his dessert,
Nick has made vanilla panna cotta with balsamic strawberries.
Really good consistency. Very nice wobble. That's a good sign for me.
Delicious.
Just enough vanilla.
And the balsamic just helps it nicely, doesn't it?
Simple, but perfect. This is my dish of the whole day.
We said at the start of this,
"The strong stay, the weak go home."
I think today,
Nick today was ambitious.
Three pretty good courses. A lot of work in there.
Our first course, the lemon risotto. Nicely made, good tang, fresh with herbs.
The main course, the lamb. Not a bad effort.
Dauphinoise was nice. I liked his sauce, but the lamb was underdone.
The dessert, the vanilla panna cotta, great!
I think even Michelle would admit she had a lot to prove today. This is why she pushed herself so hard.
She messed up, John. She messed up again.
The first course with the prawns and the salmon  
I didn't mind it. You didn't like it, nor did the WI ladies.
Seafood   bit overcooked. The broth was too strong and too watery.
The lamb we all thought was very good. There was a question mark over the potatoes.
She was in a state.
Michelle came back from serving her main course
and had not started making that chocolate fondant.
Even if they love it. 30 minutes late is unacceptable anywhere.
Linda today, her linguine with mushrooms and mascarpone
wasn't quite right.
It was too stodgy and too bland.
Sardines, raisins, pine nuts, garlic, breadcrumbs on mashed potato with carrots.
Actually, it was pretty good.
But, John, that's crazy. It shouldn't work.
I thought the posset was an absolute knockout.
Really good blend of sweetness and sharpness.
And really good little shortbread biscuits.
What are we going to do with her? She's frustrating.
Who goes? Oh, God!
Who stays? I've been here so many times. It never gets any easier.
Great effort today and I just want you to realise
how far you've come in a short space of time.
Incredible.
But, as you know, we can only take the strong cooks with us.
The first person to leave us...
..is Michelle.
Thank you.

You can see four brand new celebrities enter the competition
on next week's show. Time to answer some foodie questions. Each caller
will have a say in what Jamie will be having at the end of the show.
It's the tortellini, why can't you get this in your head! Christopher
from Cheshire, hi there. What is your question? Excuse me, I've been
given 110 gram jar of honey which contains a black summer truffle. My
daughter brought it from Italy for me and I don't know what to do with
it? Send it round to my house! to you? Lucky, lucky boy. I use it
at the restaurant and it's a great idea to use it with a bit of
dressing for a salad. That a is a simple way. Belly pork twice cooked,
glaze it before the final stages of cooking, it's phenomenal on its own
with cheese also amazing. Basically you can do lots of different things
and it's really delicious and a very special thing to have. Truffle
honey, if you put it in a bowl, mix it with olive oil and pour it on to
a salad. If you put crisp pancetta and rocket salad in a bowl and with
some chicken, that's delicious. What dish would you like to see at
the end of the show? Heaven, please. Top man! Alfie from Cornwall, are
you there? Hello, Alfie? Alfie, are you there? He would have voted for
the crab! Alfie, I can hear you? Are you there? We'll come back to
Alfie. Sally Ann from Nottingham, are you there? Good mornings, James.
How are you? Fine, thank you. is your question? How is the best
way to cook haddock, please? I love smoked haddock. It's one of the
Wiltons dishes. Simply poached in a bit of milk with a bayleaf and bow
quay garni. A poached egg, fish cream sauce with great mustard with
a spring onion mash potato. My idea of heaven. We were talking about
the classics as well. Smoked haddock is another one where you
can make an omelette, not how you are about to see, but if you poach
the fish out and flake it all off, then basically make a white sauce
out of the poaching liquor then top it with cheese and grill it with
the omelette inside, it's delicious. Two dishes. What would you like to
see at the end of the show sth favourite is heaven! Yes, you
little darling. It could all change in a minute. We've got Alfie back.
He's a Cornishman. Alfie, hello? Hello. Come on Alf. Careful, Jamie,
he's only five. Are you there? What is your question for us?
How do you make salmon really crispy? One of each? Get mum or dad
to cook it I think from the age you might be, but certainly take the
salmon, keep the skin on it, I would also then take some tissue
paper, put it on to the salmon, keep that, do not score it at all,
into a non stick pan with oil and leave it to crisp until you're
nearly half way through the cooking then finish under the grill, salt,
pepper, lemon juice. How about you? The easy way is to actually take
the fish, season it, a bit of flour, just a bit of flour on the top,
maybe put it to your season, then on a hot pan do the same and finish
it under a grill. Simpler. I think you can cut it up into strips.
Flour, egg and breadcrumbs, you can keep fry it, to make goujons. What
dish would you like to see at the end of the show, heaven or hell?
Alfie? I heard him say heaven? said heaven. Heaven or hell, Alfie?
Hell! Oh, you little sausage! had you holding on there. Obviously
a Coronation Street fan. Must be. 2 1 to heaven, got there in the end.
Now the chefs coming up against each they are to see how fast they
can make a three minute omelette. On the wrong side of the board, 32
I'm having a tenner on Silvena. 12343, 2, 1, go! Go on, Silvena.
cooked. Look at her go. Look! sure it's cooked. Very close. You
nearly lost your tenner. It's all right. It's all right. Don't show
off. This one. Nothing wrong with that, it's in the pan. You are so
nasty. Male chefs are so competitive. Oh, my God. Don't you
dare. Andrew, before you get hit,... Yes, I don't mind that actually.
That is an omelette. Thank you very much. And you are quicker than
where you were. 32 seconds can go back to you. But how quick? Not
very much quicker. 28.18 seconds. I've moved sides. There you go.
Down there. Next to Uncle Turner, the two turners together. Silvena?
Don't. Seems to have a chronic problem with the omelette on this
problem. Chronic problem. You were quicker, you did it in 26.68
seconds. Yeah. Useless! Jamie's idea of food heaven is tortellini.
The food hell was courgette risotto. Theifys in the studio haven't made
up their minds. Now a wind swept classic from Keith Floyd who is in
Northumberland at the foot of Hadrian's Wall trying to invent a
The fells are alive with the sound of curlews. This is absurd isn't
it? Just so that you can get what the director calls a sense of place,
I have to stand here on this blasted heath so you can see the
"Cook up a little something there with their little tripods
Come down and pay some attention to ME !
Thank you! Now, the purpose of this exercise is to interpret what the Romans might have eaten,
I don't know, 2,000 years ago, when they were building Hadrian's Wall.
I reckon they would have eaten quite a lot of pig, like this bit.
I'll cut it into little cubes.
Now, I don't usually complain but it is raining and I have got a temperature.
I've got pieces of pork, bits of carrot...
I reckon the Romans... Sorry about this, but this is real life stuff.
This is MY programme, please. They all know what a carrot looks like!
Onions... Don't look at the onion, they know what an onion is!
Trying to make a Roman type meal...  So we'll chop those together...
I'll chop up some garlic, 'cos it was the Romans who brought garlic here.
I need some parsley, because they were great herb users.
And what all wars were about was about spices and things!DOG YELPS
Cumin seeds, ginger, marjoram, thyme, dill, and stuff like that.
A typical selection of Roman herbs.  They had more herbs than Sainsbury's.
Because, like me, these guys were stuck out here!
And if they didn't pickle, preserve  or spice their meat it was...ahem!
Anyway, they also had wine, so they whacked in a lot of wine,
with these herbs and spices.
Being soldiers, before the time of "Please Keep Britain Tidy",
they probably tossed the bottles into a hedge!
In we put our meat, carrots, onions, and stuff like that.
And we let that marinade now for about 24 hours  
as long as it takes to do the first  700 kilometres on the decathlon.
Let me tell you about this! This was the centurion's Worcester sauce!
Walk along the wall, and I'll tell you what is and why I've got it!
Emperor Hadrian was a Spanish chap.
He got the idea to build the wall from the Chinese. Of course!
You can imagine the legionnaires munching on roasted dormouse stuffed with pine cones.
Northumbria, and here we go for complaints from other regions, is the most beautiful part of Britain.
That took me SECONDS to research! Fascinating!
But back to this liquid. This is the centurion's Daddy's Ketchup.
He wouldn't eat anything without it  because his food wasn't...too good.
I made this about three weeks ago and I've had it macerating ever since.
It is anchovies, sprats, marjoram, red wine, salt...all boiled up,
left to ferment for a few weeks, and strained and there you have it!
We ought to brand it. Floyd's Centurion Sauce. Could be a hit!
You drop a bit of it into your pork marinade.
And because they didn't have sugar,  and this is a bit pongy,
they put in a teaspoonful or two of honey.
That's why honey people are called apiarists. It's a Latin word.
There it is. You can feel it. You can smell it.
The pork, the herbs, the onions... it's been in there about 24 hours.
Now it has to go round here, in my typical Wood Mark 4, or at home Gas Mark 6...
COUGHING For about 45 minutes...
Richard, you wipe your lens. That was a bit hot.
But I have got this guy coming to dinner so we have to live with it.
COUGHING This is ridiculous!
I made a little joke about throwing  bottles but please don't be a prat and don't throw bottles, OK?
OK, Richard, back on the pot.
If we need an expert on the Romans,  the director goes straight to the pub, and finds one.
Donald MacFarlane, what DID the Romans... I feel like John Cleese...
What did the Romans do for us?
First, imagine the culture shock to the locals.
They introduced a disciplined system  of society, and along with that,which is the reason why we're here  
they introduced foods, commodities,that the locals didn't have at all    turnip, cabbage, lettuce, herbs.
Name a herb. The Romans brought it. The great British cabbage was...? Roman. Yes.
Donald, if I don't serve this, using the standard Roman utensils, it'll to be cooked to a frazzle.
We've had the Romans. What other influences stormed into Northumberland?
Well, following the Roman withdrawal  from Britain,
the Anglo Saxons came for about 400 years.
So, as a Roman historian, what do you think of my dish? It's interesting.
I think you've probably recaptured the..."flavour" of yesteryear quite well!
Oh, it's not bad actually.It's got that rough, coarse sauce, if you don't mind me saying....
My dear fellow, feel free to be edited!
I believe, sitting for three hours working my way through this...
But this rough sauce would be exactly as they would produce.
If I saw a poster in Rome saying, "Caesar needs YOU",
and this was the food you got, there's no way I'd join up!
You've got to ask the question   why DID they withdraw?

Now time to find out whether Jamie will be facing food heaven or hell.
What is that? Look, look, ingredients, look.
Could be crab. We could do tortellini with pea and parsley
soup, alternatively, the pile of risotto there, pan fried with a
little tomato ragu. How do you think they decided? I think they
like me. Only Alfie chose food hell fortunately. Little sausage.
Wonderful, so happy. I'll get this pea mixture on the go. You do the
tortellini, so roll out that. All that is is 300g of double zero
flour, three eggs, olive oil, blend it. You watching, darling? My
wife's over there. I'll get on with the filling, shall sni Yes, white
and brown meat for the filling. This is a simple soup or sauce.
It's a great way of doing a pea soup. To get the colour, if I blend
the peas, you don't get the nice colour in it. Put onions in there.
Chicken stock, although it's fish, but still use chicken stock. That
goes in. Then we are going to use some parsley and just a bit of
sherville. Blanch that in there. No more than about 45 seconds to a
minute. That's all it is. What this will do is retain the colour.
Sounds weird, but by blanching it, you retain the colour. Pat it dry
to get rid of the water. All we do then is take this in our blender.
So the onions, the peas. chicken stock? Yes. Nothing else,
that's it. Then the parsley A bit of cherville but only because it
was stuck on the parsley. A little fluke. You can really smell the
parsley. You are selling it? I am. Keep blending this. Can I watch how
you are doing that? Do you mind? Not at all. Oh, look! This is
tortellini? Thst the rolling I'm fingers. Keep going with the sort
leany. Supposed to look like a belly button apparently. Don't know
what yours looks like but... That is starting to colour a bit.
The longer we blend that, the more darker it will become. In there, I
got my baby carrots. And baby leeks here as well. We can just trim
these up. We can blanch these, doesn't take long at all. Welcome
do one more. These things, make sure they're nicely sealed.
Importantly, these can freeze really, particularly with white
crabmeat. We are using dark as well, which is waterry, don't want to
allow any of the water to go inside the tortellini itself. Very similar
to ravioli, that is how you make it. Easy as that, really. Over here, we
can see this is getting darker. We can drain these off. We can lose
that now, can't we? We can lose that? Is it putting you off? Yes,
it is. Killing your appetite. A great way of serving these little
baby vegetables. Lift these out. Drain these off. A bit of melted
butter, no more than that. Getting there. You have to be quick on your
feet in here, I know that. minutes in there. Two minutes left.
They're in. Carrots. Glaze these. Turn the heat off. Leave it. That's
in. Turn our attention to the soup. Now we can pass this through a
sieve. You can see, because I've put the parsley in there, it's a
dark intensive colour. Beautiful. Good for you, with all the vitamin
C from the parsley. I'm about to put cream and butter in it, mate.
It is nice and simple though, I have to say. Literally, this is...
A lot of iron in that, a lot of goodness in that. Is there? So my
wife tells me. The colour is so beautiful and bright, the green.
Beautiful. It's like mushy peas now. A little bit. Don't continue cook
it too much because you want to leave it like that. Warm it through.
Salt, butter, black pepper. I love you, James, I really do. I really
do, mate, I do. Do you want more butter? No, that's enough. Sure?
There you go. The tortellini is cooked. Because the filling is
cooked as well, we can drain this off with a lit ol tissue paper.   
little tissue paper. Drain that off like that. And the great thing
