The Syrian army stops the Red Cross gaining access to Baba Amr, scene
of the bloodiest shelling of civilians. What is really going on
in the area around Homs. We talk to Paul Conroy, the wounded British
photo journalist, smuggled out three days ago, who said his
colleague, Marie Colvin, died trying to alert the world to the
slaughter they witnessed. We have lost a good friend, and one of the
best has been taken from us, I salute her and I will go back and
get her when the time is right, and bring her home. Steve Hilton, David
Cameron's back room brains has quit Downing Street for California. Is
he taking Cameron's mojo with him. We will ask what his friends and
enemies think the Prime Minister will miss.
In Russia, as they vote for the new boss, he looks like the old boss.
Will they get fooled again? Russia's protest movement is
getting stronger and better organised. With Vladimir Putin
certain to win the upcoming presidential elections, what can it
Good evening, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki Moon,
said tonight, that he feared Syrian Government forces were ash trairly
executing and torturing people in the city of Homs. The Syrian army
agreed to let the Red Cross and Red Crescent into the city today, but
refused to let them into Baba Amr, which they have been pounding for
days. Our diplomatic editor has been trying to figure out what is
happening. What is happening in Homs, as far as we know? The city
status is the cradle of opposition to the regime. One of the key
focuses of it is not extinguished, but the opposition has suffered a
heavy blow there. If we look in detail at the map. The reason it
became such a centre for opposition, it is very close to the border,
that allowed people to get in and out, particularly through the
western approach, through the rural area, to the west of the city, to
Baba Amr, which is within that circle. It was the route for people,
guns, money, journalists to get in and out, and all the rest of it.
That is what made it such a focus and caldron for both sides. The
opposition forces thought they could hold on to it, and for some
weeks, during the pounding, it seemed they comfortable but the
Assad regime was gathering its forces and preparing what it was
going to do next. If we look in closer still, we can describe what
happened, over the last few days. That's Baba Amr again. Just the
centre of it. I will put the symbol for the Free Syrian Army fighters
in there. The Government already held positions in some
neighbourhoods, where people are loyal to them, in the centre of
town, and extended, during these weeks of bombardment, extended its
position in areas like the university. In recent days, they
have moved armour from, it is believed, the President's brothers
division, the mechanised division, to interdict these groups in and
out of the city to the west. That is what the journalist, who were
trying to escape, had to run the gauntlet of that. Around Tuesday,
other armoured units from the resident brigade, the 90th Brigade,
went in and cut off the northern route in and out of Baba Amr as
well. Once that situation had become a reality for the fighters
in there, power was gone, water was gone, they ordered a withdrawal.
They decided to quit Baba Amr. That seems to have happened Wednesday
night, with the Free Syrian Army announcing it on Thursday. Was
there an assault, as such, or did the Syrian army just drive in? It
seems to be more the latter. Where does it leave the humanitarian
situation for the people there? Desperate. Before this happened,
about 100,000 people living in the area. Syrian Government aired these
pictures this morning, we can tell they are recent because of the snow.
That is south towards the university area. Look at the state
of the houses, many hit on the upper storeys during the weeks of
bombardment. What horror lurks there, people who have died in
their homes, or struggling to survive on the meagre food and
water they have. That is another view from the tall building at Baba
Amr, it authenticates the cameraman was there, we can identify the
mosque, and so where the footage was taken. They are in control,
they have a ghost town, they have thousands of people in a desperate
condition there. That, perhaps, has motivated their decision not to let
the Red Cross in. Are they engaged in some sort of clearout, or as the
opposition alleges, in there murdering people. However you look
at it, tactical withdrawal or not, it is a big setback for the
opposition? It is. If you like, it must empower people around
President Assad who think they can resolve some of these issues by
force. If we go in and look closely. Homs was a divided city, the yellow
areas represent the pro Government strongholds, if you like. Now, of
course, Government troops in Baba Amr, in the north of the city, that
is the last remaining area where the Free Syrian Army still has
fighters in Homs itself. The battle is moving north within the city,
and within the country, to other places north of Homs, like Idlib. A
last couple of images to show the sort of people that will be facing
the onslaught next. These are biders in Bider taken a couple of
days ago. Quite a professionally put together position there, that
will take some punishment. Some evidence that arms are coming
through, perhaps, they say, from black market sources in Lebanon. An
AK rifle, fitted with a sniper glass, so more modern than the army.
The Government is planning to move to other places further north. They
think they can do it by force. My assessment would be they don't have
enough people to do it in all the places simultaneously, where
opposition now rages. Last weekend the British
photographer, Paul Conroy, was working with the Sunday Times
reporter, Marie Colvin, in Homs, when she was killed, alongside the
French journalist, Remi Ochlik. Paul Conroy and several others were
wounded. He has finally made his way back to a hospital in London. I
met him earlier tonight. Can we start with what happened
when you were hit, what was that moment like? It was, traumatic,
instant chaos. A few shells had hit the house, the final shell that
Marie, and Remi, my friend, everything went black, I felt a
huge pressure in my leg, put my hand down, put my hand straight
through my leg, realised it was bad, stuck a tourniquet on, and
essentially tried to crawl out of the house where I found Marie. From
that point on it was really all hell broke lose. It took 15 minutes
and we were finally evacuated to a field hospital, with the doctors,
with very limited supplies. Basics, they did what they could to fill
the holes. From that point on we entered the very basic Baba Amr
healthcare system. Over the next couple of days, what did you see? I
know you feel very much for the suffering of the Syrians around
you? Absolutely. The situation, I mean I have done a fair few wars, I
have never seen anything on this level. It is a bit of misnomer to
call it a warzone, there is no actual war. The Free Syrian Army do
their best to get in things like bread, and evacuate anyone. There
are no targets in Baba Amr, there are no military targets, this is
pure and utter, systematic slaughter of a civilian population.
There is nothing. You and Marie, of course, knew in one sense, what you
were getting in to, people at home will wonder why on earth anyone
does this? There are places in the world that light is very rarely
shone, unless people do go. We live in an age where we have the
Internet and YouTube, we see these videos, what happens is people will
take it, the regime will take it and put their commentry on, the
activists will put their commentry on, it leads to more confusion. I
think it is a necessity, otherwise we sit by and this will happen
without any witness, I think it is important to bear witness. Marie
was passionate about getting the truth out, about fact, attention to
detail. That was unsurpassed. She would go for the detail. You see in
a news report with unverified, that is not good enough for me, and for
Marie, and the few people who do this. I just think it is critically
important, these people are being slaughtered, massacred, and there
is nobody there, we will all get on with eating our dinner, and this
will happen, and in ten years time we will all be wringing our hands
going why didn't anybody do anything. I know you can't go into
details about how you got out. Give us some idea about how you did it?
There was a lull in the shelling, we were piled. It was the Free
Syrian Army took, it was a last ditch, they had wounded of their
own to get out. They knew we were in a bad shape, edit was
deteriorating, it was    Edith was deteriorating, it was a proper
American out of the embassy, type, we have one shot at this. They
threw us into vehicles, there was a lot of sniping, there were shells
going out. They got us to the escape place. Half of us got out,
the Government shot, lots of people got shot, including the Spanish
journalist who was shot, not fatal low. A lot of people lost their
lives. I was in a room, they started piling bodies in, people
shot through the head. I can only say the people who got us out of
Baba Amr, every person in there is a hero, but these people especially
put their lives on the line and I can only say the biggest thanks to
the Syrian people. Just about yourself, have you got all the bits
of shrapnel out of your body? is a few bits still in there, they
are not going to chase them. They reckon they will eventually pop out
on their own one day and I will be able with a pair of tweezers, I
don't know how it comes out. have a souvenir by your bed? This
is a present from, probably the Russians, this one. You know really,
the Syrians had the unfortunate situation where they happened to be
under siege during Putin's election campaign. And now that is him doing
all he can to help the poor people of Baba Amr. Finally, you must
think a lot about Marie? Yeah. I mean, extremely close friend. A
journalist who worked to a standard that is unsurpassed. I don't know
anyone who had the tenacity, the bravery, all in one package. She
would not let go. This is why I have really got to tell this. She
was the best of the best, and I worked all last year in Libya with
her, we worked in Iraq ten years ago together. The world, we have
all lost a good friend, and one of the best has been taken from us. I
salute her, and I will go back and get her when the time is right.
Bring her home. Paul, thank you very much.
No problem, cheers, thanks. Steve Hilton is one of those people
who pull the levers of power, without generally ever appearing in
public it's regards at David Cameron's closest adviser, but has
   and is regarded as David Cameron's closest adviser. But he
has quit to go to a job in California. He's credited with the
Cameron's Big Idea and The Big Idea society. Why has he gone? It is
largely family reasons. His wife lives in America, she commutes from
America to London. Two small kids, the first of whom goes next
September, if they are going to get out and go and live in sunny
California, now is the time. We would be kidding ourselves if
anyone walked away from Government, he had an office next to the Prime
Minister, for purely the sun. It is not much fun to be Steve Hilton.
He's thwarted often, eventhough he has massive access to the Prime
Minister, he has found the Civil Service frustrating. The icon yum
of transition doesn't translate easy. The coalition, he adored the
Lib Dems and then he came to believe they were more conservative
than he was. It is 55% family, you don't go, however, making the
decision, unless you feel thwarted. What will he do there? It is
acedemia for a year. International studies, fatastically vague. He
will do some work for Cameron. He will still be sending in the ideas
via e mail. He will come back in 2013, when kid number one goes to
school. He has talked in the past wanting to do Meryl stuff, this is
the    mayoral stuff, this is the stuff he has been pushing through
wanting mayors in other places. We will see more of him not less. He
is a big figure, which, no doubt, others will talk about. If they
have a legacy, this Government, it will be in large part down to him.
He pushed through some unpopular stuff on welfare and education.
While we parody him as the Big Society brain, which didn't really
brilliantly work, and maybe, in part, why he has decided to leave.
There are the other nitty gritty things, in Downing Street, might
have failed. He would like to go, do a bit of thinking in the
sunshine, and then come back and run as mayor? I think he will
probably come back, but it will possibly be to a frontline role
himself, rather than necessarily being an adviser, when it is not
masses of fun being an adviser when you are not getting your way.
Thank you. Joining me is the former speech writing for David Cameron,
and Lynn Collins from the Times. You know him well, what kind of
person is he? He's nice, very funny, he zings with ideas. He's an
enthusiast, he's very passionate and an idealist, he wants to make
things happen, he wants to see changes. He has very good attention
to detail, which he's not given credit for. In all that sense, is
he a bit of a loss for David Cameron? I think he's a loss for
David Cameron on a personal level, they are very close. It was said
when they are seen batting around ideas it is hard to see where David
Cameron begins and Hilton ends, they are so close. But David
Cameron is now very comfortable with being Prime Minister, it is a
biggest loss to the coalition, he is the ideas man, and he is the one
who says why are we doing that, why not do it differently. Do you see
him as a big loss? Most advisers come and go and nobody notices,
Steve Hilton made a big difference, but mostly in opposition. I think
the way people see the Conservative Party changed, and Steve Hilton saw
that early. He was clever in identifying what was wrong in the
way people viewed the Tory Party. That was hugely important for David
Cameron? Yes, in the change of the Tory Party. He has a real legacy, I
think he really made a difference. I don't think that translated
anywhere near as well into Government. Governments go through
phases, and Downing Street will be quite a lot less creative for his
absence, but perhaps a little bit more organised. A bit duller?
think they need to be a bit duller. It has been the opposite of dull on
the NHS bill, the period of dullness is what they need, they
need to get dull people in there to do some very conventional political
intelligence, and drive it through. In terms of the Big Society, I know
people in the Conservative Party, some of them have thought this was
a completely daft idea, it is one thing to have lots of ideas, but it
is presumptionably the Prime Minister's job to say that one will
work and that won't, with the Big Society there will be less
impetuous on it? David Cameron believes in the Big Society, Steve
Hilton didn't impose it on the Prime Minister, he genuinely and
passionately believes in it. It is important to remember the last time
Steve went to California in opposition, the Tories were doing
very well and were 45% in the polls, and the Big Society was part of the
language being used. It was when he went and the language went on to
convention issues like cuts and crime, that the Tories began to
drop. It was a myth that the Big Society was not a success, it was
doing well elect trally. Given his energy, he was somebody who
embodied that within the party? has been hard to translate it into
policy. It is hard to take the Big Society from an ethereal idea and
embody it as a real policy. I don't think it has translated
particularly well. It is interesting the Prime Minister
hasn't mentioned it for quite a long time. It will be intriguing to
see, coming up to the conference speech, whether the Big Society
features as a theme in the conference speech. It is still the
only overarching idea the Government has. It has gone missing.
Can either of you see him coming back into frontline politic, again,
one of the things about people who have lots of ideas, they also rub
other people up the wrong way, and actually being in frontline
politics means not making unnecessary enemies? I think he is
telling people he doesn't need to come back after a year, it is
unlikely he will come back to the same role. He wants to make change
and make things happen, there is a very good chance, not a definite
chance, a good chance he will come back and do something such as
perhaps going for the mayor or something like that. I think Steve
Hilton is searching for where power is in Britain, I think he has got
to the side of the Prime Minister, and got into Government, in Downing
Street, he has found power isn't quite there, because you are
thwarted at every turn, and the Civil Service seem to run things
without you doing anything. He will be become, people who know him well
say that, he will seek out power in some other guise. I wonder, going
back to what you were saying, driving things through, whether
people do enough thinking in politic. It is a good idea if you
have a big thinker to take a break and think some ideas and come back?
I think you are absolutely right. It is such a maelstrom of events,
there is not nearly enough thinking, that is why he's so important
because he does think. I totally agree, I have said to people there
you have to find space and take time out to think, without thinking
you are just reacting to events. The Government needs a strong
narrative, which perhaps it doesn't have at the moment, because it is
all a narrative for cuts. It is more boring for political
journalist, perhaps? I don't want to give the impression I'm against
thinking, I'm strongly in favour of people thinking. I don't want them
doing it while in Government, they are dangerous. What it meant is the
Government, over the next two years, in the run up to the election, is
in the implementation phase of its cycle. The health bill, for example,
doesn't even begin until it goes through the House of Commons. Then
it starts to really count. And you need that vigilence all the time.
It is quite hard conventional political work. Number Ten at the
moment is very, very underpowered on its political operation. I think
if David Cameron uses this as an opportunity to get some fairly
conventional political advice in there, and beef up his operation,
actually it won't be such a bad day for him.
On Sunday Russians go to the polls to vote in their presidential
elections, everyone knows who will win. It seems certain that Vladimir
Putin will be re elected for a third term, although after recent
weeks of protests, unprecedented since the last days of the Soviet
Union, his next presidency may be more turbulent than the last. We're
in Moscow assessing the mood of the opposition ahead of Sunday's poll.
In Moscow's Gorky Park, it is time for a knees up.
The end of the long Russian winter is almost in sight.
They are celebrating mass lenitza, the carnival before Lent, the last
chance to fill up on pancakes. I have been coming to goarkyo park
since I first lived in Russia    Gorky Park, since I first lived in
Russia, back in communist times. It was always a place of licensed
entertainment, where the masses could play, as long as they towed
the party line. And loyalty has been expected of them again since
Vladimir Putin came to power many years ago. Now something is going
wrong. I want to    want to know if life is as sweet as
a Russian pancake. She says it is just as round! She says everything
goes round in circles, in a political sense too, she's
referring to Putin's plan to come back as President, after a term as
Prime Minister. But now there are people, even in
Gorky Park, who have had enough of him. I will vote
against Putin, I don't support his policies, I will vote for one of
the others. We shouldn't go backwards. Putin has already been
President before, and I think his time has run out.
think the presidency of Vladimir Putin's shouldn't be repeated so
often. Why? There is too much corruption in Russia.
Where did the rebellion begin? One place was this quiet forest outside
Moscow, where a young entrepeneur and mother liked to go walking.
Suddenly, one day, five years ago, she discovered many of the trees
were marked for felling. There were trees all
over here, this was terrible Barberism to destroy a forest near
Moscow, here we managed to stop them. These activists helped her
stop the plan to build a motorway here. The plan of a tycoon closely
linked to the Kremlin. They were injured in battles with police and
contractors, and for now, they have won, though they keep a constant
vigil here. But she wants    once apolitical as most Russians, is no
longer fighting for trees, she's one of the leaders of a movement
fighting for a new democratic Russia without Vladimir Putin.
Five years ago I was a typically anonymous person, I
thought it was only a few crazy city types who went on
demonstrations. I ran my business, I got three university degrees, I
raised two children, all by the age of 35, but I always thought there
was something wrong. What did I need all the money for? Then, when
I saw the trees account down, I started to think, should I live   
cut down, I started to think, should I live differently, you
can't buy another forest, I didn't come to politics, politics came to
me. Suddenly, Russians like these have turned from subjects of the
state into citizens. They are no longer satisfied with the material
comforts that Vladimir Putin can offer, they want a say in the
running of their country. But are there enough of them, and are they
organised enough for the Kremlin to care?
The answer is, yes. This pro  Government video paints an
apocalyptic picture of Russia without Putin.
The country dissolves into anarchy, Chirikova and her opposition
friends take over, and their alleged backers in the west are
delighted. Can a woman, who spends so much of her time looking after
her daughters in her tiny flat really scare the Kremlin so much?
Of course, they are afraid of me. But it is the same as
when they tried to discredit dissidents in Soviet times t has
the opposite effect. People want to know where they are abusing us.
Then they get interested. Then they join us. Today she's being
photographed outside a polling station, for an internet campaign
to recruit election monitors. We are confronted by an angry
official, who wants us to leave. Back home the photo is uploaded and
will be seen all over Russia. These young people are already
being trained by an independent organisation to observe proceedings
in polling stations next Sunday. But there aren't enough volunteers
like this, particularly outside Moscow, to cover all the polling
stations in the country. And maybe the result has already been decided
any way. I think we will rewrite the result documents, through the
electoral commissions, where we will give all result documents from
polling stations and they will calculate, and if they don't see
that the result which they need, so they will just put another number.
But I don't think that way they will cheat a lot on the voting day
from the polling stations, there will be a lot of observers to
prevent those violations and prevent them. So usually when they
are trying to rewrite their result document, there are no observers to
see this process, so it is quite easy to do this.
The fear that the election will be stolen brings thousands of
Muscovites out on to the streets, a week before the poll, to form a
symbolic ring around the city. Most wear the white ribbon, that has
become the badge of the fair elections movement. Bizarrely,
puten to said they looked like flaccid condoms, now in satirical
response, they are waving blown up ones. Yevgenia Chirikova is here
too, in carnival costume, to celebrate what she calls the
approaching end of Russia's political winter.
most important thing is to change the way people think. We are not
struggling for power, we are struggling to drown this slave
mentality out of ourselves. On a day like this you really feel there
is a new spirit in Moscow, for people who have woken up
politically, their demands remain so general s it is still not clear
what they can achieve. In any case, the opposition is
still largely urban and middle  class, it doesn't represent the
whole of Russia. The man they want to beat still
bestrides his country's stage. He would probably still be able, even
in a fair election, to win a mandate a western politician would
consider acceptable, even if not a genuine majority of votes. He has
no clear programme, only the same patriotic rhetoric that hasn't
changed in years. have come here today to say we love
Russia. To say it so that the whole country can hear us. And I'm asking
you to say a simple yes, the question is this, do we love
Russia? Is it the rhetoric of a former spy chief, who can't see how
his country is changing? One of Russia's best selling
novelists says social change will eventually sweep Putin away.
Middle class is a new class in Russia, it has a lot of energy, it
is very much different from middle  classes in the west. Because to sur
vief in the 1990s in    survive in the 1990s in Russia, to become a
member of the middle class, you had to be strong and you had to fight.
With very harsh conditions of life, with corrupt police, to fight
against authorities. This is a class of winners, and survivors.
This is Putin's main problem, I think. Back in Gorky Park, the
middle class is testing its strength in a traditional carnival
and for now, it is still the state that decides who gets the prizes.
In a moment the review show, and Kirsty is here to tell us what is
coming up. Tonight two different takes on
British history, from the 1960s to today in White Heat, and the
financial crisis of 2008 in John Lanchester's new novel, Capital. We
also journey to Mars in Disney's 3.D epic, John Carter, and mark the
icon Lou Reed. That's all from Newsnight tonight,
Jeremy is back on Monday. The singer, Morrisey, has ensured
himself of another year without a Knighthood, after declaring the
British people know the Falkland islands belong to Argentina, we
don't have any footage of the concert in Argentina where he made
the pronouncement, we will settle for this.
