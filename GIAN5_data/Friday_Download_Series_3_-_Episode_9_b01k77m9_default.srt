Give it up for your Friday Download presenters!
Welcome to Friday Download!
Now, England are through to the quarter finals!
Obviously that means we've all had a great week.
  What have you been up to?
  I've had a good week, I saw my boyfriend
at the farm where he works.
Aw!
Is your boyfriend a farmer?
Is this your boyfriend right here?
  What is he doing to that cow?
  No, he's feeding it.
It looks like the cow is biting him!
It was a calf or something, so it hasn't got any teeth yet.
Does he talk like this?
FARMER' "'Ello Georgia. Welcome to my farm.
"I'm milking my calf!"
No, he does not speak like that! It's pretty cool.
Leading on from that, I don't know if you've noticed
but, you look a bit tanned, Tyger.
I'm glad you mentioned it,
because I did make quite a large effort on the sunbathing
when I went on holiday to Turkey with my beautiful mummy.
That is in one of the restaurants
and the view was spectacular, to be honest.
It's all right for some!
You took the words right out of my mouth. It's all right for some!
I don't know if any of you guys know,
but there was actually an earthquake while I was away.
  An earthquake?
  Which was 6.1 on the Richter scale.
  So you felt it?
Yeah! I was just chilling on my sunbed and suddenly,
  it was like this rumble in the ground.
  Did your drink drop?
Yeah, I spilt my drink. There was loads of glass smashed
  and my sunbed started skidding...
  What was your first reaction?
It went a little bit and it was like someone kicking my sunbed
and it skidded like a metre. The water came out of the pool.
  Did you fall over?
  No, I was on my sunbed.
So you were like, surfing?
It was over so quickly that everyone was like, "Did that just happen?"
  Bromfield.
  That is me, yeah.
  You've been away as well, haven't you?
I went to New York, it was nice.
You went to Turkey, that's nice as well!
Fair enough, but New York is glam.
  Have you got any pictures?
  I took one.
  Was that of the Empire State building?
  Or Times Square?
  Statue of Liberty?
  Which one?
It's of me on a plane.
You look lovely.
My mum actually had a massive go at me,
Cos I was meant to be taking loads of photos.
I've got the memory of a goldfish, so I literally forgot.
Did you have to take on the plane? We need a picture!
It seems like we've all had a great week
and we've got an amazing show for you today. Here's what's coming up.
Aidan has two very special guests in Dance Download.
I've got picnics covered in Style Download
we've got your hot right now music tributes.
Tracy Beaker star Daniel gets kiting in Weekend Download

Redemption Days.
Don't go and waste another day.
Just take what comes your way ohh
If you know what you want to feel And how high
Do you want to feel it?
If you know what you Want to say...
Hello and welcome to another Dance Download.
Now, this week I'll be teaching you a small routine slash move,
to The Wanted's Chasing The Sun remix.
Right, now to help me teach this routine,
I've got two people with me this week.
I have two members of Diversity, Perry and Jordan!
So, it's been a while since I last saw you. What have you been up to?
It's been crazy, man.
We've just finished our third UK tour which is all arenas,
which we're really happy about.
And since we've been back,
we've been crazy busy filming the new series of Secret Street Crew.
So, what I want to know is,
what's been your favourite moment of your career?
Like, you don't have to say dancing with me obviously!
I think that might be top five, dude.
  Top five? Not even top three.
  Top three, of course!
What's second and third, then?
Definitely our third UK tour, where it was all arenas.
Like, the 02 Arena was huge
  and was definitely one of the best things we've ever done.
  Special.
  Right, so, you've told us your highlights, but Jordan...
  Yes, mate.
..one of your highlights must be meeting Little Mix
because, as we all know, you're going out with Jess!
Ooo!
The funny thing is, we've known each other since we've been kids.
We grew up together so I knew her before the whole Little Mix thing.
Yeah, I'm really proud of her.
Aw!
Right, so anyway, let's go onto the move.
The movement we're going to learn this week is like this.
Arms out, then wave back, bang.
So, hit here, body, up to the arms?
Yeah. So, stand with your arms out first.
  Then it's like a normal wave but you put your arms backwards.
  Twist.
So it's like a twist of your arms, then down.
Legs out, bring it back up.
Bring it out with your left arm.
Then, wave up.
Then, as if you're waving with this arm, but stop at the wrist.
  Connect it?
  And carry it on.
  Nice.
  Connect, nice word. So we'll connect the wave.
Go down, then bring yourself round.
So, you've got the move now.
So, I'm going to do it slower to teach everyone in the audience
and everyone at home, and you're going to do it with me.
So, put your arms out.
Now, it's just like doing a wave,
so we'll do both arms at the same time, but we'll do it backwards.
So, bring it up to your shoulder.
Then we're going to do a body wave downwards.
Now we're going to bring it back up.
But do it outwards, with only the left arm.
And then, we're going to wave this arm over here.
Like a little worm, just wave it. Connect it with this hand.
Connect.
Now we're going to wave with this hand,
then stop it with this arm, and carry it on with this arm.
Body wave down, and bring it back up.
Have you got it?
Yes!
Oh, sounded quite good!
So, we'll do it all together, and then do it to the music. All right?
Yes!
So, arms out.
Now, in, down, back up,
left arm, wave over,
wave down, around, and bring it back up.
Boom! I'm tell you when to come in and we'll do it all together.
Are you ready?
Yes!
Let's go.
Fist pump, fist pump, first pump!
Ready? Now!
  Did you get it?
  Yeah.
Go again.
Now.
And again.
Now you go.
Right, altogether... Dance Download complete!
  Mr Prawn?
  Yes, Mr Frog.
What do you get when you cross a skunk with a boomerang?
  I don't know. What?
  A lousy smell you cant get rid of!
Hello, everyone, welcome to the Games Download.
I have Aidan and Richard here
and the first game we're doing today is Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes.
Basically, you venture around Gotham City solving puzzles
and ultimately trying to stop the baddies.
  So, Aidan, you're going to get up and start paying.
  Let's do this.
Right, as I say, it's the normal city of Gotham but it's all in Lego,
just as if you built it.
The game's got all the traditional bad people in it,
like Catwoman, the Joker, the Penguin and all that.
And one of the cool things about the game is,
it's the first game in the series to have voices.
You know previously how they were all like...
This time, they all speak.
Now, Aidan, that's an underwater costume so you can go down here.
And you need to go down there to do that thing on the floor.
Press circle on that.
Now you've activated that.
Basically, this is how the game works...
  Can I switch to Batman?
  Go on, then, switch to Batman.
  Oh, you're playing with Batman?
  No, there's Batman.
Now, Batman does that and you basically solve
a series of puzzles consecutively to get each other.
Now I can go through the electricity!
Exactly.
The game is really cool because there's not only one plotline,
but you can wander around the entirety of Gotham
and do different things when you want to.
So, if there's more than one plotline,
does that mean you can be more than one superhero?
Well, actually, you can play as over 70 different superheroes.
Can you give us a few examples?
Well, you've got, like, Wonderwoman, the Green Lantern,
Flash, Superman...
Superman's cool cos you can actually fly.
What are your impressions from the gameplay, Aidan?
  Oh, I love it.
  Did you like it?
  He's picking it up quite quickly.
  He is.
I don't know if you can notice from this, Aidan,
but the gameplay's quite dark.
Most of it seems to be set at night time and in dark buildings.
Sometimes, it can be quite hard to see where to go, especially
if you were playing with the curtains open.
  So, you enjoyed that, Aidan?
  I absolutely loved it.
At the start, I wasn't too keen, but now I've got into it.
That was DC Superheroes.
And now it's time for Tyger Versus...
Whoa! Whoa! Where's the gadget?
We don't have one this week
and that's why we're moving on to Tyger Versus...
You are the gadget man, you can't miss out on a gadget.
I know, I apologise profusely, everyone,
  but I couldn't find one this week.
  Well, what about this Nintendo Wii U
that everyone is on about? Me and him are.
You know what? You've made me feel terrible. Wait there
and I'll be back in less than an iota. OK, right.
I'll do you proud, stay there!
Right, Aidan, this is solely for you
so I want you to remember and appreciate that.
Anyway, I'm here at a top secret location in London ready to
go inside and take a look at the new Nintendo Wii U.
It's not out for a few months yet but I'm really excited
so I want to go and have a look at what's all the fuss is about.
You're all right, mate? Thanks, cheers.
Right, OK. So this is it.
Pretty much the coolest gadget around at the moment.
It's not even out till later in the year and I've been very lucky
to get some very special permission to play on it today.
What's cool about it is there's two screens.
You have your regular television screen and then this
integrated 6.2 inch touchscreen right here on the gamepad.
When you play, you use both screens
and these screens offer different experiences to different players
and that is called asymmetric gaming.
So I'm now playing on Donkey Kong's Crash Course which is
one of the games from Nintendoland and it's a pretty complex
and fun looking maze I have to navigate my way through.
What I think is helpful,
it's really good, is on the big screen
there's an overview of the entire maze
but on here it's only got the bits I really need to concentrate on
so I've got two perspectives which is unusual but very helpful.
This is Ski, it's a game on Game & Wario and I'm playing on...
Oh, it's quite hard.
I'm playing on a skiing game and basically
you have to slalom downhill using the gamepad vertically
to get as fast a time as you can.
So this is new Super Mario Bros U.
It's basically like the traditional Mario games,
you're trying to navigate your way across a level and collect coins
but what is cool about it is you can do this thing called Off TV Play
where you can just play the whole game independently on this.
Oh, come on. Right, so that is it.
Actually I should probably get back to the studio.
  Tyger, I've got to admit, I am impressed.
  Did I make up for it?
  You definitely did.
  OK, I'm glad, I did try and do you guys proud.
I have to be honest, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.
It's really weird because obviously the Wii is very active.
  Yeah.
  You've got one thing, but it's completely different.
  I didn't expect that.
  It's quite big as well.
So that's something to watch in the future,
that concept of asymmetric gaming but that is the Nintendo Wii U.
Now it is time for Tyger Versus
so if we can have the rest of our presenters on.
It actually really is Tyger Versus this time.
Don't worry, I won't go running off again.
So, yeah, welcome guys. You guys know what Tyger Versus is.
  There's a golden envelope somewhere.
  Here.
  Oh!
  So what's your name?
  Lucy.
  Lucy. Hello, Lucy. You have the golden envelope.
  Yep.
Can I confirm you've never shared the contents of that with any of us?
No. You have not. Thank you. You've been fantastic.
Please may I have it? Little round of applause for Lucy.
OK, so here is today's Tyger Versus. I'll look inside and have a read.
"Today's Tyger Versus is a dance game.
"Follow the moves on screen dancing along to Justin Bieber,
"Somebody To Love.
"The winner will be the player with the highest score
"at the end and the console's decision is final."
  Come on, Aidan.
  I'm really bad.
  Dancing to Justin Bieber, whoo!
  I need somebody to love.
  It's not singing, it's dancing.
Please can we find out on The Randomiser who I'm against today.
  Hello, Mr Randomiser.
  Hello, Aidan Davis.
  Oh, it's Di!
  Oh!
  Wrong field!
  Come on, Game Queen!
  Oh, no!
  You've got to do this.
  You don't know...
  Follow the guy on screen, yeah?
  Mm hmm.
Then we'll just see how it goes.
  Are you ready?
  No! BELL RINGS
  Just feel it.
  Oh, oh, oh!
  Have a little groove.
  Look at the legs.
  Go.
Tyger, Tyger!
Dionne, Dionne, Dionne!
Come on, Dionne! Yes, go on, Dionne!
OK, what you got?
Rollercoaster! You need a miracle!
  Oh, my days. Come on, Dionne.
  Nail it, nail it.
Nail it, nail it, nail it.
Rollercoaster, rollercoaster.
  It's the arm.
  Ring the alarm... ring that alarm!
Yes, yes. Ring it down.
Yes, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on.
  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
  Come on then, give it up.
No worries, I've got no worries at this moment. No worries.
Finishing move!
Finishing move, Michael Jackson it.
Whoo!
Fantastic, Di. I have to say, I'm sure everyone knew,
  that was so close.
  That was an awesome come back.
  She was actually a head most of the way.
  Exactly.
For some reason I managed to get it back.
In a horse race, you'd be a closer.
So the score was 4 4 but it's now 5 4 to me
and that is the Games Download complete.
Welcome to TV And Movie Download.
Now, first up, I'm quite excited about this.
It is Disney's new animation out next year in February
and it's called Wreck It Ralph.
Now, Wreck It Ralph, he's a bad guy in an arcade game.
After 30 years of doing his job, he's had enough.
You know what, he's sick of being the bad guy. I don't blame him.
So he sets out, leaves the game, goes on a quest to become the hero.
He goes through all the different games in the arcade.
You see very familiar faces in there.
However he unleashes the worst enemy of all
which threatens to destroy the whole of the arcade
so it's down to him to become the hero and save the arcade.
Will he do it? You'll have to watch it to find out.
Sure must be nice being the good guy.
Nice share, Ralph. As fellow bad guys,
we've all felt what you're feeling.
  I am Zangief, I am bad guy.
  Hi, Zangief.
Ralph, you are bad guy, but this does not mean you are...bad guy.
I don't want to be the bad guy any more.
Ralph abandoned his game.
Where's the wrecking guy?
Welcome to Game Central Station.
  Trains for all game destinations now boarding.
  What's your name?
  Wreck It Ralph.
  Why are your hands so freakishly big?
I don't know, why are you so freakishly annoying?
I know the film isn't out till February next year,
that's just a preview so you're very lucky to have seen that.
I'm a kind person. Don't mention it, guys, honestly.
OK, onto TV now and my first pick is The Big Celebrity Clean Up.
Two teams of celebrities, one being my mates Jedward
and the other, actors from EastEnders, Joe Swash
and Nicola Stapleton are going against each other
to turn some wasteland into a fully functioning learning centre.
They have to get together some volunteers and rally them up
and see who can do it better
and do it in the fastest time as they only have eight hours to do it.
And a group of volunteers are also turning an old,
worn down building into urban art, it'll look amazing, fingers crossed.
They also are against the clock.
I'm quite excited about this and it's all in preparation
for the Olympics so we can all get in the spirit. Let's take a look.
Three, two, one...
  Come on, team, let's go!
I want you to take this and put it in the skip.
Come on, Team Yellow, brighten up this garden!
When you come back I want you to finish up this whole mess.
What's he doing? Joe, that's got to go in the skip. That's cheating.
You've got to take it around, put it in the skip.
  You can't just lob it over the fence.
  You know something?
  Scraping up, it's quite hard work.
I'm really excited for that show but I wonder how Jedward will do
with keeping concentration and getting the job done,
the task in hand in the time limit?
Maybe the EastEnders actors will also struggle.
OK, next up is Radio One's Big Hackney Weekend Highlights.
If you didn't get to go to the event,
you can watch it all again in the comfort of your own home.
Your famous Radio 1 DJs such as Fearne Cotton, Greg James
and many more helped present the show and headlining is Jay Z and Rihanna.
Massive. It is the biggest free ticketed event in Europe
and the line up never disappoints.
From this day on, the world will never be the same.
Ten...
'..Nine...'
Eight...
'Seven, six, five...'
'..Four, three,'
Two...
'One.'
I know, I really wish I could've gone to that but don't worry, guys.
I will be there joining you watching it at home, enjoying it.
The film on your TV screens this week is Charlie And The Chocolate Factory,
the Tim Burton version.
The film is based on the Roald Dahl book but obviously
cos Tim Burton's directing it, it's got a very weird twist in it.
I really like it.
Johnny Depp stars in it, my main man nails it as Willy Wonka.
The synopsis is Charlie is a poor boy, not much has happened to him.
Gets this golden ticket and is one of five people
to go to the chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka
which has been closed down for ages. However things are going on in there,
Oompa Loompas there and it is very, very good.
Let's take a look at Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.
Daddy, look over there.
What is it? It's a little person.
Over there by the waterfall.
  There's two of them.
  There's more than two.
  Where do they come from?
  Who are they?
  Are they real people?
Course they're real people, they're Oompa Loompas.
And that's TV And Movie Download complete.
Still to come on Friday Download...
In a hopeless place.
  Is that done?
  Ooh, there you go, that's good and now to the left.
Don't go and waste another day
Just take what comes your way
Oh, if you know you wanna feel
How high do you wanna feel it?
If you know what you wanna say, oh, I...

  Thank you.
That's Star Download complete with the new champions. Yes!
I'm Georgia. Welcome to Style Download.
I'm in my home county of Buckinghamshire to help plan for
one of Britain's favourite pastimes   the picnic.
Let's just hope the weather holds out.
I love my cat, Willow and two awesome lizards.
I have decided I wanted a picnic with my friends
but I have no idea how to organise it.
Which is why I've been sent in to help.
Picnics are one of my fortes so let's see what I can rustle up.
  Hello!
  Oh, hello!
  I'm Georgia. Are you surprised?
  Yes.
  Is it OK if I come in and explain why I'm here?
  Yeah.
  Thank you.
OK. Tell me why you need a Style Download.
I'm thinking of hosting a picnic but have no idea how to.
  OK. What is it you like most about picnics?
  The food.
I have to agree with you on that one.
  Anything you don't like?
  Maybe when we have ice cream or cold food.
  It normally warms up.
  Yeah, that's horrible.
I have some ideas that can solve that problem.
  I hear you're a fan of music.
  Yeah, definitely.
I have an idea you might like to do with that.
What I need from you is to find the essentials,
the things we need, from around the house  
drinks cartons, an old rug and a jar. Do you think you could find that?
  Yeah.
  Brilliant. Off you go. I'm timing you so hurry up.
I'm only getting started
I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I won't blackout
I'm on my way...
Great. You've got everything I said to get. Awesome.
One thing we need to tackle is keeping things cool.
A great way to keep things cool is with ice.
But not just any ice.
You take these and I'll take these and follow me.
The great thing is you can put these in the freezer the night before.
On the day of the picnic, you can pop them in your bag.
Not only do they keep everything cool,
also you can use them as dessert.
  Yeah, I love ice lollies.
  Great. Just remember to pack a spoon.
Now it's time for the important part, the music. Lead the way.
I know how you love music.
So do I. I've got an ingenious way of making sure
everyone else enjoys it as well.
All you need is this.
  Bit confused?
  Yeah.
What I want you to do is get your phone out, play a tune,
put it in the jar and see what happens. OK?
Pop it in the jar.
Cool.
A bit loud maybe.
  Lid back on?
OK. Turn it down for next time.
After the food, what's the most important thing for a picnic.
  Probably something to eat it on.
  You're right. The rug.
The problem is, after all the food is packed,
  there's not much space for it, right?
  Yeah.
I have a solution for this.
It involves some rope as well.
Follow my lead and all shall become clear.
Live your life, live your life
Let that love inside
It's your life, it's your life...
There's one snack sack, if you will.
It may not be the most beautiful thing in the world
but it sure does the trick.
Now all we need to do is wait for a sunny day to arrive...
..then we can enjoy our picnic.
Let the sun shine, let the sun shine
Let it all go, let it all go, baby...
Planning for the perfect picnic isn't just about the food.
If you want to be prepared, follow these simple steps.
Sling it over your shoulder and you've got a bag that
doubles up as a picnic rug.
Everyone loves listening to music at picnics.
Lugging your stereo along can be annoying and expensive.
All you need to do is find a spot to enjoy your picnic. Easy.
That's one happy customer, even if it was a washout.
At least he'll remember to bring his umbrella to the next one.
That's Style Download complete.
Welcome to this weeks's Music Download.
Usually, I'm joined by Aidan but the person I'm joined with today
he's done it once with me but he was good so we've got him back.
Richard and we've got an audience as well.
  Hello to the audience.
  Hi, guys.
My first pick is will.i.am featuring Eva Simmons with This Is Love.
This is love, this is love this is love
Can you feel the love
Can you feel the love
Can you feel the love
This is love, this is love this is love
Yeah
Yeah
  Yeah.
This is love for the bass
And love for the treble
Love for the orchestra, violin cello
Love for computer beats
Harder than metal
House beats houses, bouncing in the ghetto...
  What do you think of the track?
  Love it.
I found out why he shot the video in England.
Where Is The Love, when it first came out,
he said he had the best response in England then all over the world
so he decided to shoot this video in London.
Did you know he directed it himself and produced it?
Everything was done by him, which I think is really talented.
And will.i.am is loved in the UK right now.
He's on The Voice, he's also done the torch
and if you see in the video, the Tower of London is in it.
My next pick is AlunaGeorge with You Know You Like It.
I know full well
I know full well
I don't take these as they come
If they bring me down
Life can be cruel
If you're a dreamer
I just want to have some fun
Don't tell me what could be done
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you want what you gonna do...
What do you think of the track?
I quite like it. It's growing on me. I like the bass line.
When I first heard it, I wasn't keen on it but it's growing on me.
  The bass line is really nice.
  It's very different.
I've not heard anything like that before.
Aluna is the singer and George is the producer?
It's a partnership. They said that when they go into the studio,
all they need is biscuits, tea, a bit of music
and that's how they write.
My next pick   he'll be performing next week  
it's Adam Lambert with Never Close My Eyes.
You know that I wish that this night
Would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep
When we die
So let's just stay awake
Until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes
Our eyes
Never.
  What do you think?
  I think his voice is amazing.
  He's so good.
  I can't wait until he comes on the show.
I'm so surprised he didn't win American Idol.
I know. I watched the year he was in.
The way he grew throughout the show.
I like how he's a bit different as well.
  Yeah, definitely.
  It's the hair, the look and everything.
  He seems like a nice fellow.
  I can't wait to have him on the show.
You'll be rocking away.
My next pick is Chris Brown with Don't Wake Me Up.
Don't wake me up, up, up up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me
Don't wake me u u u u up
Up
Don't wake me u u u u up
Don't wake me u u u u up
Yeah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up...
  I know you love Chris Brown.
  I love Chris Brown.
My favourite artist of all time was Michael Jackson.
My second is Chris Brown.
The only thing I'm upset about, he's gone a bit auto tune
when he put an effect on the voice.
It's not as natural as two of his albums, Fame and In My Zone.
But because it's Chris Brown, it works.
It does but I'm used to hearing that R&B vibe.
I do like the song.
It's not like I don't like it   I love Chris Brown.
I think he's taken it too far...
  You wanted a bit more R&B.
  Yeah, that R&B sound.
It's all about the voice then, isn't it?
I get what you mean. It's wicked, though.
  I do like the song.
  You can dance to it.
Definitely.
So my final pick has got a summer vibe to it.
Now, the song's been around for a while.
It's called Redemption Days and it's actually by Josh Osho.
  Didn't you tour with him?
  Yeah. Yeah, I was 13 at the time.
That was quite a while ago now.
He's actually here to perform it for us today.
Everyone, give it up for Josh Osho!
Sweet, sweet were the memories
The songs and the symphonies
That we had yesterday
Ohh, free
Free were the city roads
That now feel so overgrown
That it's hard to escape
But deep beyond the surface lies
An eminence that never dies
Before was so unjustified
But still you carry on
You're a soldier
Oh, you're a fighter
Don't go and waste another day
Just take what comes your way, ohh
If you know what you want to feel
How high do you want to feel it?
If you know what you want to say
Oh, I want to hear you say it.
If you know where you want to go
How far do you want to take it?
Cos no matter what mistakes you've made
These are your redemption days
No white flag outside your door
We'll navigate them for the shore for an easy get away
Your mind
Looking out for circumstance
It's really going to make the difference
To know the right game to play
And voices tell you to behold
Upon the wreckage lies a soul
That knows a path to fields of gold,
It's where you want to reach
You're a soldier
Oh, you're a fighter
Don't go and waste another day just take what comes your way, ohh
If you know what you want to feel
How high do you want to feel it?
If you know what you want to say
Oh, I want to hear you say it
If you know where you want to go
How far do you want to take it?
Cos no matter what mistakes you've made
These are your redemption days
You're a soldier,
Oh, you're a fighter
Come out like a boxer
Hit a little harder
Like someone's just let you out
Run to get off the ground
Don't go and waste another day
With what you've got left to deliberate
Ohhh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
If you know where you want to go
How far do you want to take it?
Because no matter what mistakes you made
These are your redemption days
I say
Na na, nanana, na na na
Nanana, whoa, whoa
Na na, nanana, na
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa
These are your redemption days.
Everyone, give it up for Josh Osho!

Guys, welcome to Backstage Download.
Now, for this Backstage Download, it's all to do with Wimbledon.
As it's on Monday, we thought kind people that we are,
we'd have a little challenge
to see if we can get any ball boys or ball girls
  and see if they're up to the task.
  We did.
  Invite your first contestant in.
  Miss Lock. Come over.
  Miss Lock.
  Hello!
  A little boing there. Mr Richard Wisker.
  A little boing. Love the outfits.
  Looking lovely, guys.
  Thank you so much.
  Looking good for this.
So, basically the task is, you are going to try
and hold as many balls as you can in your hands. OK?
I will be loading you, Richard. Dionne is loading Georgia.
Go. OK. Two, four...
Sturdy start. One, two, three.
  Put some on the wrists, yeah.
  Six. Eight.
Eight, nine, ten.
  In the corners, in the corners, in the corners, in the corners.
There's got to be a method, guys. 19, 20.
  Keep going.
  Ooh! Di. Oh.
You got 26, that was good.
38, drop them. Drop them!
We beat the girls! Oh, yeah!
  Unlucky, guys.
  Yeah.
I mean, it is all right, but I think Richard is the perfect ball boy.
  I reckon.
  You are the perfect ball boy for Wimbledon.
  Ball boy! Ball boy! Ball boy!
But, for now, that's...
  Backstage Download Complete.
So now it's time for this week's Fail Download.
Now, because Wimbledon starts on Monday,
we thought we'd have a look at some pets who are batty about tennis.
Now, check out Andy Purr ay and his friend.
"To me, to you, to me, to you."
Great volley.
They have both got great paw hands. Paw hands. Get it?
Paw hands? Forehands? No? Amazing.
Now, we all love a bit of table tennis,
but this dog is BARKING mad for it. Just look at his little face.
There it is. There it is.
There it is. There it is. There is.
There it is. Oh, I'm exhausted just watching him!
Now, this is more like it. What a tennis pro.
Not just one ball in his mouth, no, not even two. Not even three.
Four balls! Yes, four balls in his mouth.
You don't see the ball boys and girls on Centre Court
doing that, now, do you?
That's Fail Download complete.
Hi, guys. We are two of Diversity. I'm Perri. This is Jordan.
What is going on, guys?
What did Batman say to Robin before they got in the Batmobile?
"Robin, get in the Batmobile."
Is that a joke? OK, cut. Is that a joke?
So, my TBR co star, Daniel,
has been out for another Weekend Download.
Now, he is trying to catch the perfect wind.
Confused? Hmm, I am.
Let's take a look at this.
Hey, I'm Danny.
And, this week, I have hit the coast for Weekend Download.
And, today, I'm going to be flying a kite.
But not just any kite.
I'm George Dufty.
I'm 15 years olds and I am one of the UK's best youth kitesurfers.
I've been kitesurfing for about 2.5 years
and I've been kiting for about three.
There are loads of reasons why I love kitesurfing.
It's a combination of a lot of my favourite sports,
like surfing, kite flying, skateboarding.
And, plus, you can get really big air
and that's one of the best things about it.
  Hi, George. Nice to meet you. I'm Danny.
  Hi, Danny.
So you're a bit of a kiting expert, yeah?
Yeah, I'm currently second in the under 19s British championships.
That's pretty cool. So that looked pretty dangerous with that big kite.
Am I going to be flying about like that?
Not necessarily.
First of all, we'll work on a trainer kite,
which is a much smaller version.
It will get used to how to fly the kite and where the power is.
So then, eventually, you can move onto that.
  So will go and get suited then?
  Yeah. Sorted.
  Right, talk me through it, then.
  Well, this is your trainer kite.
This is two metres compared to the nine that we had over there.
First of all, we've got to lay it out flat, downwind.
  There's upwind, where the wind is coming from.
  Here's downwind.
Like this.
  OK, so...
  OK, there we go.
Here, you've got the bridles, which is this bit..
This bit, which is attached to the kite.
Now, we'll put it onto the ground. And then we can lay the lines.
OK, you need to lay the kite down, otherwise it'll just blow away.
Just grab something heavy, like a shoe.
So you're going to use your shoe? OK.
Right, let's get the bar.
We're going to lay the lines up under the kite,
so we just unwind them, like this.
Go on, then...
So we're ready to launch now. I'm going to hold the kite like this...
  ..to get the air in the kite.
  You run down there and grab the bar.
Step back and pull into your hip.
Hey!
All around the side, you've got least power.
If you just keep it at 12 o'clock,
it's in a stable position, you should be fine.
  That's really cool.
Right, so now I've got this relatively down,
  I want to know how to turn. Will you show me how to do this?
  Yeah.
  So...
  Take that off me.
  Instead of a car, which steers like this,
you want to be pulling left and right.
You pull your right to go right and to go left, you pull with your left.
It's really push and pull.
He can do it without looking.
You need to when you're putting the board on.
You've got one hand, then you put the board on.
The wind's a lot lighter now. If you try bringing it from 12 to 3.
  OK. Whoa.
  That's all right.
  That's it.
  Is that good?
There you go. That's good. Now to the left.
That's it. So you can bring it over to 9, over there.
That's it. That's really cool. And then back over to 3.
If you're looking into getting into kite sports, the best thing to do
is buy a small kite   between one or two metres would be really good.
And with a bar is even better.
You don't need much wind to learn to kite, but a windy day always helps.
Giving kiting a go couldn't be easier.
Get a stunt kite for as little as £10
and get down to your nearest park to try it out.
Set it up following its instructions.
Grip the handles or bar to take off
or you can get a friend to release it for you.
Bring your hands down infront of you to the flying position
and try to keep the kite at 12 o'clock position.
To turn right, pull down right on the bar and to turn left,
pull left on the bar. Simple.
Your goal should be to move the kite in a figure of eight movement.
It's just like riding a bike...
but without the pedalling.
To land, bring your bar forward
and it should drop out of the sky.
Never launch in high winds and aim to keep your feet firmly on the ground.
Unless you're an experienced flier.
The smaller the kite, the easier it is to learn.
George used a harness on his bigger kite,
but you should only attempt to use a practice kite when starting out.
I cannot believe how much I've learned in just one day.
That means that's Weekend Download complete.
There's just one problem, he didn't tell me how to get it down.
George!
George! George, how do I get it down?
George!
That looks wicked. Next time the wind's up,
I'm definitely getting involved in some of that.
Well done, Daniel. That's Weekend Download complete.
Welcome to Hot Or Not and we have some fantastic guests with us today.
You saw them in Dance Download earlier.
It's Jordan and Perri from diversity.
  Perri, do you want to go first?
  Cool. So my one is Slap Watches.
  Can you demonstrate them?
  Demonstrate for us.
  Are you ready?
  Don't hurt yourself.
See, that fits really well(!)
I'm going to kick us off by moving over to the other side.
  There's not much space, to be honest.
  I'm going hot.
  He's going hot.
  I think they're hot.
  There's space now.
What do you like about Slap Watches?
They're just easy.
You know when you're in a rush, and you try to get your watch on.
  This, you just whack it on.
  I'm more old school.
  Old school, just...
  Yeah.
It saves so much time, don't you think?
This takes longer.
You're not going to keep it like that  
you'll have it on your windowsill like that, so you have to...
I want to feel it...
  Your hands have got to be a little bit...
  Look, it doesn't even...
  Say if you do it upside down.
  This would really bug me.
So you're on not hot? Why are you...?
I'm on not hot. It was just a squeeze.
Do you wear this type of watch?
  I don't, but I still think they're...
  ..a good idea?
They're all right.
That's not hot.
Next!
  My one is denim and denim.
  Double denim.
Oh, no.
No.
Seriously?
I'm wearing a denim top, denim shorts and denim shoes.
You're doing triple denim.
I am. I am, in fact, doing triple denim.
That looks cool.
If it was triple, I'd be there, but the Hot Or Not is double, Tyger.
I think if you wear a blue denim jacket and blue denim things,
you end up looking like a cowboy.
If your top was the same colour as your shoes, then it will just...
It could work with Tyger if he stuck a cowboy hat on.
Yee ha!
So double denim is not hot.
My one is a web suggestion. From Lemon Smelly Pigeon.
I love that name.
And it's actually...
Is it food?
..giraffes.
Not a teddy giraffe   real life giraffes.
How can that animal not be hot?
You know, I think they've ideas above their station.
Those necks are devious, they're just sneaky. They're like...
Fantastic impression.
Not only that, they're taller than you.
A little fact for you   apparently, they cannot cough.
Another fact about animals, you know snails breathe through their feet.
We are talking about giraffes.
It was a fact I would like to share with everybody.
  Do snails even have feet?
  I thought that, but it is true!
Giraffes are hot.
OK, mine next.
My Hot Or Not is inspired by a party I went to the other day.
It is fancy dress.
There is a picture. I was a bunny rabbit.
Did you go to the party with the carrot?
I love dressing up.
It was meant to be an animal theme but then there's a hotdog.
  I've changed my mind.
  No. Have I completely ruined it?
Why are you not hot?
The hotdog nearly swung me,
there is something disturbing about people dressing up as other stuff.
I would refuse to dress up and put a little mask on.
Even if it was just a mask for the eyes.
Zorro. Just wear a Zorro mask.
It's a draw It's a draw! It is a draw!
Diversity face off.
It is rock, paper, do it.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Yes!
Best of three.
No, it's not hot.
Unfortunately, Georgia, fancy dress did turn out to be not hot.
It is my Hot Or Not and I have an audience suggestion.
We have Mischa over here.
  What is your Hot Or Not?
  Sand.
Like on a beach?
Everyone, crowd over.
  How is sand not hot?
  It sticks to you.
  Think of the beach.
  Think about the Seychelles.
You go on holiday and get covered in sand.
We were on a holiday a few years ago. I made the best castle.
It went underground.
  Yes!
  One story, that's what happens.
I have never liked the beach.
If my mum and dad go to the beach, I will stand on the path. I hate it.
You don't like sand either then?
I feel like I am lying in a box of cat litter.
It is all spiky and unnecessary.
We are on a draw. The deciding vote is down to you, Mischa.
  Do you think sand is hot or not?
  Not hot.
  Yes!
  Yes!
That was the klaxon, but before we finish, I want to remind you
there'll be an extra special episode at the end of the series.
For our last show on 20th July,
we'll be giving you the instant download for the summer
ahead and going to show you the best bits from this series.
And that is when you guys come in.
It is the part of the show when we want to hear what you guys think.
Guys, head over to the CBBC website
and let us know your favourite bets. It can be anything.
Make sure you tune in on 20 July when you might see your best bits.
A big thank you to Perri.
A big thank you to Jordan.

For this week's music tribute,
I cannot help but did you the British version of Rihanna.
She was on the show a few weeks ago
and me and Dionne even went to the same school as her.

Eh oh, eh oh, eh, eh
Eh oh, eh oh, eh, oh...
  I loved it. I love the energy.
  It was amazing.
I love the little doggies.
I even saw some of Aidan's dance moves in there.
I was just going to say I loved the dancing.
Did you see Oscar worthy Oscar rocking away on the drums?
  I was digging that drumming.
  It had a good beat.
  What does that say?
It's Music Tribute Download complete.
