to independence or simply tidying up the law making powers of what
goes on and that building behind me? The arguments have been well
rehearsed over the last few weeks. Right now they are counting the
votes so it is it a yes or no? Hello, good morning and welcome to
an important date in the story of Wales. Within the next few hours,
you and I will see a story unfold across this country that will
colour the way in which we all live our lives. Just in case you missed
it, yesterday, the country went to the polls to be asked whether or
not this place behind me is to be given direct law making powers in
areas that are already devolved. The question is, will it be a yes
or Aynho? You will be the first to know. We have comprehensive live
coverage of all 22 counts as they happen. Let me take you on a quick
journey around Wales to see what is happening, perhaps in your neck of
the woods. The vote was yesterday. Right now, the votes are being
counted in sports halls, schools, council officers. This is a leisure
centre where the votes on Anglesey are being counted. This is the
scene in Pembrokeshire. This is Haverfordwest. It is a school there.
Their have been flat out in Newport since roundabout 9 o'clock this
morning. And we are going to pop into Swansea market. It looks
colourful, doesn't it? We will talk to shoppers there to see what they
make of all this referendum stuff. Keeping me company all morning is
our political editor, Betsan Powys. It is a hugely significant day,
isn't it? It is. We will probably spend much of today discussing
turnout and there is unofficial gossip, I think we have to call it
at this point, that it was under 30 % in Newport. It is around 30 % in
Flintshire. On the other hand, Carmarthen and Llanelli have 44 %.
How will that balance out? We will no doubt discuss that. And clearly,
we will be discussing the figures as they come in and discussing the
complexity of the issue. If Wales votes yes, I don't think we should
miss the fact that there will be four legislators in the UK, England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all of which will be able
to make laws which will affect their own countries. It has not
been the case here for many centuries. I don't think we should
miss that point, that significant constitutional point if that is
what happens today. We should find out during the course of the day.
It has been a long journey to this referendum. If you are as old as
ass, you know we have been here before. Rhun ap Iorwerth has
plugged into his computer and he will give us some context today.
Yes, my job today is to paint a picture of what goes on as the day
goes on. This is the picture right now. No results in Wales. We will
see that map being Holiday Inn as the day goes on but we can take you
back in time. This was the referendum result in 1979. All of
Wales but voted No back then. Wales voted 4 1 against. In 1997, this
was the picture. Just over half of the counties voted for the assembly
which was set up two years later. The question is, where are we now
in 2011? I have been delving through the archives so why will be
able to take you back in time as we tell the story of devolution over
the years. Thank you. Today is one of those days when those usually
cheaper, confident faces of professional politicians who we see
on the TV all the time, can relax those rather fix smiles. The
campaign is now over. Many of those will be gathering in the Senedd
behind me to await the result. Our reporter, Bethan Lewis, is there
now. Good morning, everyone. I AM in the Senedd building, not far
from your studio. It is here later on where the result of the
referendum will be announced from that podium just below me. The
Electoral Commission are making some introductory remarks to tell
people what have been going on. During the course of the day we
will be getting results from the local authorities and I will be
talking to the politicians, the campaigners and the pundits about
how the campaign has gone and getting their reaction to the
result. Will also get a turnout figure later on, may be about 11
o'clock. It is quite quiet here at the moment but it is a lot    it
will get a lot busier as we get caught the final result. Thank you.
We will be back there in a few moments. If you are over the age of
40, you'll be thinking we are on familiar territory here. This is
our third referendum in just over 30 years. We got off lightly. The
Swiss have had dozens and dozens. They are the world champions. Let's
have a walk down memory lane and a short history lesson. We will go
through their history but it is important to remind ourselves what
this referendum is all about. If you have voted, you will have seen
this ballot paper and give it does not just include the question, it
includes a raft explanation about what the change is. Here is my more
detailed explanation. The assembly already has powers to make laws on
arranger if subjects. Agriculture, ancient monuments, culture,
economic development, education, environment, Fire and Rescue, food,
health, the way the assembly itself works and sport, recreation,
tourism, town and county planning, water and flood defence and the
Welsh language. It is a long list. But you will notice what is not
included, defence, policing, welfare benefits, they are in
Westminster. Is a list of 20 subject areas in total. Within
those areas it can only pass laws on some matters. Every time it
wants to pass a new law that it has not done so in the past, at the
Assembly has to ask Westminster for permission. Beat Welsh Assembly
requests a Legislative Competence Order asking to be given competence
to pass the law. The request can be initiated by the Assembly
Government and committee or an individual AM. Then it goes through
a lengthy process and scrutiny. Once it has been approved by
Assembly Members, the First Minister informs the Secretary of
State in Westminster. He or she then put it before Parliament. It
has to be discussed by the House of Commons and the House of Lords and
only when both houses of parliament give it the thumbs up, will it be
passed on to the Queen for royal approval. Yes campaigners well 
tended that that process is far too lengthy and unwieldy. It gives
Westminster the opportunity to frustrate the Welsh Assembly's
wishes. It allows proper scrutiny of law making requests. Coming back
to that question, it do you want the assembly to be able to make
laws on all matters in the 20 subject areas that it has powers
for? Put it another way, there are no new subject areas the assembly
would have powers over, it would just be allowed to flex its muscles
and exercise the powers it already has without having to ask
permission of MPs and Lords first. That is it. Thank you. Let's have a
look round the country. I think we can go over to a Llanelli first of
all. This is the leisure centre which ordinarily at this time of
day would have people running around playing football and hockey
and squash and indoor cricket and a whole variety of things. You can
see that everyone is pretty busy there. There is a certain sort of
cachet about being the first local authority in Wales to declare. Not
that anyone Russia as this. They will all want to be first today.
That is the scene there. Let's head over to Aberavon on. You can see
that similarly they are leafing through vote so there. We will be
popping in and out all over the country over the next 20 minutes or
so. That Sam, let's have a quick word about turnout, we have been
talking about the importance of turnout. We are getting an official
figures suggesting turnout, what have you got so far? Quite a lot
early on. The first official turnout is from Flintshire and it
is nearly 32 %. Last time round, Flintshire was the lowest as far as
turnout was concerned. This does not sound so disastrous as maybe
some people had been anticipating. I AM told Blaenau Gwent will be the
first to declare a result. Alan Davies is confident it will be a
good Yes vote. I'm told Pembrokeshire and Newport are tight
as far as yes and No are confirmed. Wrexham are confident of no vote.
Bridgend is 2 1. First Minister Carwyn Jones has been talking about
that majority. Listen to this, Rhonda, a huge Yes vote is what
they are anticipating of 75 %. I think one Leighton Andrews will put
his feet up tonight with a very big smile on his face if that happens.
Neath Port Talbot was the largest Yes majority last time. Peter Hain
has reminded us since 1997 that Neath delivered the largest Yes
majority. He is tweeting that he is confident of a very big Yes vote
but will it be the biggest this time round? We will wait and see.
There will be people watching and they will say if it is in the 30 %
for turn out, it is not the ringing endorsement that many people and
politics will want, is it? It will not allow this place behind us to
speak with confidence and authority. Rhodri Morgan was saying the higher
the turnout, the better. That seems absolutely clear, doesn't it? There
has been talk that because of the complexity of the issue, Kim
Howells on the No side said this is a trivial referendum. It is about
procedure. How would you galvanise people to turn out and he was a man
with a strong view that there should be no vote. You hear people
on the Yes side, the opposite pole saying it is ridiculous that there
is a referendum at all on this issue. They seem to be joining on
an issue saying they are not surprised that the turnout will be
low. I will say if it is thirtysomething rather than
twentysomething, the people on the Yes side will be happier than they
might have expected to be. No campaigner will say it is a ringing
endorsement. If it is in the 30s, it would allow politicians in Wales
to look politicians in London in the face where the London
referendum got about 34 %? Absolutely. Cast your mind back to
1998, do you want a London mayor or not? Turnout of 34 %. The Labour
Minister them, Glenda Jackson, said it was not a sign of apathy, it was
a sign of certainty. I wonder if they will try the same argument
this time. They have to accept that people feel ill informed. Why was
that? Is it because it is a complex issue? Is it because they did not
understand how it would change their day to day lives? Is it
because people were trying to scaremonger and confuse? The No
vote people would say they did not. All the evidence is we have an
opinion poll on BBC Wales today which said nearly 50 % of people
said they did not feel they had enough information. I think there
will be a time for reflection on this whole process. Just talk us
through the timetable of what we can expect in the next few hours.
AM told 1145 AM is when there will be the first official results from
Blaenau Gwent. Then we hope the results will coming thick and fast
so early afternoon we will know where we are. You will see it all
here on BBC Wales so you will not miss a thing. Campaigners from both
yes and No campaigns are gathering in the Senedd as we speak. We can
join our reporter, Bethan Lewis who is there. Welcome back to the
Senedd. I'm joined by a Labour education minister and a leading
figure in yes campaign, Leighton Andrews. Howl of the nerves? We are
quietly confident. We are disappointed about the turnout. I
think we are looking forward to seeing a positive fate today and I
want to pay tribute at the outset to the thousands of hard working
volunteers who have campaigned so hard for yes vote campaign over the
last couple of months. For you said you are disappointed about turnout,
what have you heard about levels of We expect the turnout to be
relatively low. Are you talking 30s? Around 30% at the moment. As I
say, we don't have any firm figures. We will discuss that later. What I
hope we will see is a convincing result for the "Yes" campaign.
People have been out there explaining the issues to people. I
think the result, I hope, will be a vote of confidence in the future of
the Assembly and that is what we are looking forward to. As the
"Yes" campaign, what have you been hearing? It's sounding as far as we
can see positive. We don't have any firm figures, of course. We won't
have any firm figures until the proper count starts. At the moment,
people have been looking at the verification. There is a lot of
activity on the ground. We have people in all the counts. I am sure
the BBC has its people in all the counts. We believe that today we
will see the Assembly coming of age. If you are talking about
disappointing turnout figures, does that show people haven't been
engaged in this campaign? I think, clearly, the decision by the ""No"
campaign    "No" campaign, not to apply for the official status,
dispite that, our volunteers are    despite that, our volunteers have
done an amazing job, getting over 1.5 million leaflets distributed.
We have been very much up against it. We have had to raise the money
to do this. We have had a grassroots campaign. They have done
fantastically well. We would have liked to have seen a higher turnout.
The nature of the issue being discussed must have affected the
level of interest? That's right. It is a complicated issue to put
across to people. Even the question on the ballot paper reflects that.
The Electoral Commission has done a reasonable job in the material it
has put out. It is complicated. We have had to spend our time
explaining what the issue is about. At the end of the day, what we will
see today is that the people of Wales are ready for the Assembly to
march on. Leighton Andrews, thank you very much. A nervous few hours
for you. Back to you, Jamie. Thank you very much, indeed. It's 10.47.
A warm welcome to you. You are watching Referendum 2011, live
coverage of the results as they happen here on BBC One Wales. This
is the story so far this morning. There are 22 counts under way,
across the country. We have cameras at all of the counts. You will see
your local count in the next hour or so. So far, we think the turnout
is forecast to be low. We haven't got any hard figures. Many people
in both camps are talking about  turnout in the low 30s. We do have
Denbighshire, where it is 34% turnout. In Merthyr Tydfil, under
that magic 30 figure that's been talked about in the course of the
morning, just under 29%. There are local counts across the country.
The results will be collated and re announced in Cardiff Bay during
the course of the next few hours or so. This is the scene in Cardiff
Bay. This is the scene in the Senedd at the moment, lots of suits
from all of the campaigns, lots of AMs, lots of campaigners who are
rather relieved to see today, after it's all over, perhaps not always
receiving the warmest of welcomes from the good voters of Wales. At
least the sun is shining which may put a smile on their face. We will
come back there in the next half  hour or so. Now, just as soon as we
get a first result, we will take you straight there. You won't miss
a thing. We will take a moment now to look back to the first
devolution referendum and Rhun has fond memories of wearing flares!
Your legs were probably longer than mine! 1979, the referendum then was
a real kick in the teeth for supporters of Welsh devolution who
had reached several significant milestones through the 20th Century.
You can point to several things that led to the creation of Wales
more as a political entity. The establish of the Welsh Department
of Education. That was in 1907. The disestablishment of Church in 1920
and then you had some pretty major steps. The creation of the post of
Secretary of State for Wales with a seat around the Cabinet table in
1964, Jim Griffiths, the first man to be given that title of Welsh
Secretary. Around that period, you had Plaid Cymru's first electoral
success. He became Plaid Cymru's first MP in 1966. Taken together,
you have the national question As a result, devolution proposals
were drawn up by Labour's Callaghan Government, initially a Wales and
Scotland Act but then a Wales Act passed in 1978. There was to be a
referendum in March 1979. Devolution supporters were furious
when an amendment to that Bill supported by Neil Kinnock demanded
a 40% threshold to be reached before an assembly could be
established. As it turned out, that was academic, the "Winter of
Discontent" as a backdrop, with Labour's gang of six, the tide did
swing very clearly towards a "No vote. We have a clear of a very
bullish Neil Kinnock speaking at the time. If we are really going,
if we want extra resources, if we want extra resources for Wales, and
we desperately need extra resources for Wales, the way to fight for
them is as a unified movement. won the argument. This is how Wales
did vote on 1st March 1979. Purple is the "No"   the total vote   four
to one against devolution. It was a hammer blow to the devolution
supporters. Among them John Morris. Our policy has been rejected by the
people of Wales and when you see an elephant on your doorstep, you
recognise it and you concede defeat. It is a clear defeat. Clear defeat,
indeed. Indeed the idea would be dead for a generation. Thank you
very much, indeed. Now, in a few moments, I will take you to Newport,
we will go to Torfaen, but let's cross over to Cardiff and let's
talk to our reporter who has been watching counting there. Have you
got any intelligence for us, any word on turnout, or perhaps a
result? It is probably a bit early? It is. We are expecting a result
about 1.00pm. Counting is well under way here. This potentially is
the biggest count in Wales. The Cardiff Council area has a
potential electorate of 250,000 people. Just to give you a reminder
of our great point of reference, which is 1997 and what happened in
Cardiff, the city of Cardiff, it famously voted "No" and Cardiff is
the Welsh capital, there is always symbolism and the kind of irony in
a way that the city voted "No" to a National Assembly which was going
to house itself and be situated within the city of Cardiff. I'm in
a leisure centre in the north of the city, a few miles from you,
Jamie, and I think it will be interesting today to see maybe how
attitudes have changed in the capital. Obviously, it is a very
different set of circumstances, very different referendum, a much
more technical question being asked. There have been some interesting
comments on this made by some prominent figures in the city, most
notably the former First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, he was saying from
what he can remember back in 1997 and in 1979, he detects a lot less
hostility around now in the city than back then. I suppose the other
irony about Cardiff voting "No" in 1997 was over the years,
potentially it has benefited the most by physically having the
National Assembly in the city, bringing with it certainly a point
of reference to regenerate Cardiff Bay, a lot of that work was going
on anyway. It gave a big boost to that area and that is a big
important part of the city. Yet, at the same time, if you are out and
about in Cardiff, there is still a bit of an uneasy relationship, I
suspect, with the National Assembly and I think one of the interesting
things will be how that attitude has changed and what we can maybe
read into any figures that we get which we will get earlier on this
afternoon and specifically on turnout, a little bit too early to
say on the kind of numbers they have had here. All right, thank you
very much. We will come back to you as soon as there is a result there.
I will come to Newport in a few moments and we will talk to our
reporter Sian Lloyd who is reporting there for us. Let's go
over to Torfaen and our reporter is there. What news do you have for us
from Torfaen? Well, I just had a quick look before you came over to
me, there were seven boxes left to be counted here. I have been
talking to "yes" campaigners I have had a look around for some "no"
campaigners, there are none here today. The "yes" campaigners are
telling me the postal votes in Torfaen are round about the 60%
turnout and the turnout is expected to be roughly around 30%. In terms
of any declaration or any result here, as I say we have seven boxes
left, so it won't take that much longer. Just to give you an idea of
Torfaen and the sort of context of referendums here. In 1997, Torfaen
was the tightest result in the whole referendum campaign. Torfaen
voted "no" but only by 98 votes. It was in a "no" sandwich if you like
with Monmouthshire voting "no" and Newport. As I say, I have been
speaking to the "yes" campaign, they think it will be tight. They
think they might carry the day. Here, in Torfaen, the "no" campaign,
True Wales...they have had a real presence. Rachel Banner, she's from
the area, she is a member of the local Labour Party. But really that
is not really going to be given as many hints as to what is going to
be going on today. In terms of people who will be here observing
the count, the local MP, Paul Murphy, who was one of the leaders
of the "no" campaign, he will be here later on. He has changed his
tune, and he said he will be supporting a "yes" vote this time.
So maybe we will hear from him in the programme later on. Thank you
very much indeed. The picture in Torfaen. Again, we will be back
there as soon as we have any further word on you on hard turnout
figures and the results. Let's go over to Newport now where the count
is taking place at the Civic Centre. Our reporter Sian Lloyd is there
for us. What is the picture there? Well, I have news for you. We have
the turnout figure here, it is 27.9%. 29,215 votes are being
counted by the 32 people here. They have verified the votes in the
count. The people of Newport have looked towards Westminster in the
1997 referendum. The turnout was 46%. It was 62% of those who voted
voted against devolution. Back in 1979, it was 88% who voted "no" to
devolution. Could the political wind be about to change? I have
been speaking to John Griffith, the AM, a Labour AM for Newport, he
tells me from the spotters who were looking while the verification
process was going on, he feels there may be a "yes" vote this time.
That would be a significant boost to the National Assembly. Of course,
it is far too early to tell. The actual counting process began some
half hour ago, after the verification, and we had the
turnout number. So we are going to have to wait and see on that one.
We are told that we could have an announcement here at midday, Jamie.
Sian Lloyd, thank you very much for the picture there in Newport. If
you are sitting at home thinking "Why?" haven't they come to our
place, we, I promise you, will be heading over to your neck of the
woods during if next half hour or so and you will see all the results
here live as it happens. If you are switching on BBC One this morning
and hoping to see Wreck or Ready, this is live coverage of Referendum
2011. Wreck or Ready are taking a break today. You are watching BBC
One. All the results live from every corner of the country. You
won't miss a thing. Over the next half an hour, we will whisk you
around the country and who knows, we may even get a result. Let me
bring you up to date with the time coming up to 11.00. The stories so
far this morning: We have 22 counts under way across Wales. The turnout,
we think, is forecast to be low. We are getting reports of round about
30, 31, 32. That isn't a hard figure. We will have more on that
during the course of the next 20 minutes or so. I want to take you
over to the Senedd where our reporter Bethan Lewis is joined by
a variety of interesting guests. Let's have a word from her and the
Thank you. We have heard from Leighton Andrews from the Yes
campaign. Now I am joined by Rachel Banner from True Wales, the No
campaign. Leighton Andrews seemed happy, how are you feeling? It does
not look like it has gone our way and we would have liked no vote
because we think politicians should be focusing on what we really
elected them to do, sorting out health, education and a economy. We
can see the turnout will not be very high. We have said all along
there are people out on the streets demanding more powerful politicians
in Cardiff Bay and it looks like that is the case from the turnout
figures. So, the intelligence you are getting from your supporters
across Wales is you have not won it. Our intelligence is that
intelligence    turnout is low. What about the results? We just do
not know. On the streets when we were campaigning we had a lot of
positive feedback but the Poles are all against us. We will see what
happens. What accounts for the lack of interest, the failure of people
to turn out to vote, if that is how it turns out? I think this is a
referendum which should have been held five years ago when law making
powers were introduced to the Assembly which was what we were
promised in 1997. We were told there would not be any further
change. We had the government of Wales sacked. Now, the politicians
have tried to narrow this to a technical matter. We think it
should have been a discussion about where we want to go with devolution,
how far down the road we want to go and how far we want to fragment or
break up the UK. That debate did not happen. Technically, in terms
of the question, it is not about that. Obviously, you referred to
wider issues as the    as DBS pang    yes campaign but people should
just focus on the issues? The aid is unlikely we will get a
referendum on a separate legal jurisdiction for example or
separate devolved crime and policing. Those things are likely
to happen without a referendum. Tax raising powers as well. There
is no guarantee what will have another referendum before the next
one on independence. At some point in this devolution journey, people
should be involved in a discussion about where it is going. It does
look as if there will be no meaningful public discussion on
this issue. You have portrayed results as a grassroots campaign
but is it true that you did not have the numbers of campaigners
across Wales to really campaign effectively? I can assure you that
in the north east, our team will be quite upset at that idea because
they have been working their socks off. Similarly around the
Carmarthen area. There have been working very hard indeed. We have
built this group up over the last 2.5 years and we are planning to
continue to put pressure on to ensure that when those changes come
about, we will highlight and remind the public, when politicians denied
that they would make those changes, before March 3rd. True Wales as a
body will last after this referendum? We will continue. We
will be working to ensure that the UK does not fragment and we will be
pressurising politicians in Cardiff Bay to do the job that we elected
them to do. Rachel Banner, thank you. True Wales is here to stay,
you heard it here first. Back to you. That is fascinating and thank
you, Bethan. Bethan is in that building, the Senedd. I am in one
of those nasty cheap tense. These were borrowed from Glastonbury, I
think, judging by the smell of mud. That is where we are at the moment.
BBC Radio Wales and BBC Television and S4C are all sitting in those
white tents. Whatever the result today, today is a significant
milestone in the story of Wales. We do not know how the result will go.
We do not know about the turn out yet. But the counting is going on,
pretty frantically. This is the scene going on in Newport at the
moment. You can see the speed we are    they are getting through the
voting papers. This is the Cardiff count. It is a huge operation, as
you can see. All of those people doing their level best to be first.
We do not know who will be first but all of them would like to be.
Let's chew over matters with two fascinating characters, Professor
Laura McAllister and Professor Martin Johns. I think whatever
happens, it will be a significant day for Wales. I suspect there will
be a fairly convincing Yes vote as all the polls have predicted and
all the rumours and gossip around these parts have been suggesting.
The other thing we can say is that the turnout will be disappointing,
probably hovering around the 35 % mark which is not a great ringing
endorsement of enthusiasm for the question that has been posed to the
Welsh people. You have written extensively about the turnout and
the issue, if you are not steeped in politics like you guys, 30 % of
people rocking up to decide the future of the country is not good,
is it? It does not look good on the surface but it is inevitable when
you have a referendum. I do not think we should beat ourselves up
in Wales about this. You have the same issues for referendums in
England. In London, loads of media coverage and yet only a third of
the population turned out to say whether they should have a mayor or
not. While there are specific Welsh issues here, there are wider issues.
People are not that interested in politics any more and we have to
face up to that. There is a problem with the Welsh Assembly, people do
not like talking about this. The reality is, for people watching at
home, a lot of what goes on here does not impact on their lives.
They do not care enough to turn out and vote. It impacts on their lives.
They do not think it does. This place controls most of the public
policy decisions in Wales but the real difficulty is they do not see
that it impacts on their lives and they do not understand the nature
of the powers which will reside here. That is a significant
challenge which will face whichever government comes in. This is one
stage in a much more important process to actually engage in the
Welsh public towards understanding what is happening in their new
politics. I think you are right, we are a long way off that. Should we
have had a referendum on this question? Why do governments hold
referendums? Governments hold referendums when there is a
controversial issue when they want to pass the buck to the electorate.
This was not controversial enough. We should not have had a referendum
at all. We should also be careful and how we interpret the turnout.
It is easy to say 70 % of people don't care to vote but we do not
know why people are not voting. Some people are not voting because
they do not understand the issues. They want to but they do not ill 
informed enough. Some people are not voting because they think it
will not make a difference. On one level they are right. The problem
the Yes campaigners had his they were not able to say, this is
something concrete we could do which we cannot do at the moment.
All it has been about his speeding up a political process. I don't how
many people you but don't to over the last two weeks, a lot of people
I have talked to his they said we are voting on past performance. It
is clear, a lot of people have voted on how the Assembly has
performed in terms of the delivery of schools, the health service and
he economic development. That is typical of referendums worldwide.
We cannot compare a referendum turnout or the result for that
matter, with a straight forward election turnout because they are
different animals. I was looking at some figures for Switzerland and
they are the Manchester United of referendums, they have had 180 in
20 years. The turnout averages around 40 %. But there are huge
differentials. When there is a major issue of real import, the
turnout is up in the 70s. When it is much less significant it is in
the 15 to 25 %. We are not a typical here. We have to put it in
an international context. The other issue is people will choose what
they vote on and you have no control and nor should we have on
that issue. That is one of the drawbacks. If it is 34 or 35 %,
what all that mean in terms of the way people do their business and
the way this place is perceived not just in Wales but beyond? On one
level it will not make any difference because the decision on
   is on who gets the most votes. On another level it matters
profoundly because governments need to feel they have a mandate. If
people do not vote for them, it is easy to feel that they cannot take
difficult decisions, they cannot take anything too radical. They
will suffer for that. Maybe one good thing is we will decide how we
vote. We live in a modern digital age, it is crazy that you have to
vote in only one place, you do not have to take along a piece of paper
but people think they cannot vote because they have lost their
polling card. We should be thinking about how we can engage more people
in the political process. If the low turnout Wicks people up to that,
maybe that would be a good thing. We will talk to later, thank you
for your thoughts. We can take you to the first results as soon as it
comes in. You will not miss anything. We have a turnout for
Powys. 39 %. Rhun ap Iorwerth, that have a quick word. Just looking
back in the history, we look at 1979 and how it was a kick in the
teeth for the devolution supporters but if the debate did not die out
completely them, it went quiet for a long time. By the late 80s, there
were signs of a revival in the pro devolution campaign within the
Labour Party. Neil Kinnock was leading the Labour Party at that
time and it was not until he was replaced by John Smith that the
idea was back on the table. When he died, Tony Blair won the election
for the Labour leadership and he promised to complete his devolution
project. He would deliver it devolution for Scotland and Wales.
But John Smith did not see that a referendum was needed. Tony Blair
thought differently. He thought that they needed to be a referendum
because it was an important constitutional step. Yes campaign
that was to campaign for a Yes vote, it launched in February 1997,
before Labour won their landslide victory. They were poised and ready
to go when Labour said they would be a referendum in Scotland on
September 11th and a Wales a week later. There were initial questions
about whether there would be an opposition that a No campaign did
emerge. You remember that it became a pretty lively campaign. I'm sure
we could do with a reminder. Yesterday, Scotland's vote. Next
week, Wales will have its turn to speak. I ask you to come out then,
You should make sure the Tories cannot get in. At least... Bowl,
don't talk like that! It is going well. I think we will win it this
Thank you very much, that is Peter Hain saying he thought they
would win it and they did win. This was the result. The question was
just to be a vote on the principle, the question, I agree there should
be a Welsh Assembly or I do not agree that there should be a Welsh
Assembly. We know what happened. It was a very different result from
1979 but it could not have been closer. It came down to the very
last count. Carmarthen Shia voted with a resounding yes and cue
celebrations from a very happy Secretary of State for Wales.
morning. And it is a very good morning in Wales. Today, is one of
the most important days in the He said devolution was going to be
a process and not an event. It was close, a few thousand votes. Of
course, that raised questions about the legitimacy of that result. A
mere 14 years on, here we are with another referendum on taking
devolution to another level again. Thank you very much. That is the
history. What we don't have yet is a result for you. Of course, we
will have them. It is all getting exciting here. They will be
happening in the next half an hour or so. You will see it here live.
You are watching BBC One Wales and Referendum 2011. The time is 11.15.
Why don't we tell you the story so far and the main headlines:
Counting is under way now in 22 of the local authorities. We are
getting reports of a variety of turnouts, ranging from low turnouts,
round about 28%, and we are getting high reports of 34% or 36% turnout.
We are getting reports of a 70% turnout in Blaenau Gwent, who knows.
We are getting anecdotal reports of turnout expecting to be low. 28%
turnout in Newport, the lowest we have heard so far. 44% turnout on
Anglesey, that is a lot more respectable, isn't it? 29% turnout
in Flintshire, not so respectable. So there we are, the first turnout
figures coming out. We will get more on that as it happens. Let's
turn to the historian Martin Johns from Swansea university and the
political commentator, Professor Laura McAllister. What changes will
ordinary people see in their lives? Back in the real world, how is it
going to play out, why does it really matter? Well, I think there
is a split between the symbolism of what it looks, of what is likely to
happen today. Whereby, we are giving the Welsh, the National
Assembly the powers to actually decide on which laws it wishes to
make without any recourse to Westminster. So the centre of
gravity is changing, that is important. That is very symbolic.
That won't mean a great deal to ordinary voters. What it will mean
is that there will be a no excuses culture. We have heard a lot from
the politicians where they have said, "Give us the tools to do the
job"   in effect, they will have the tools and when they stand for
election in eight weeks' time, they have got no excuse, they can't
blame it on the limited powers that this institution has. In that
respect, the electors can expect more from their politicians, quite
rightly so. Martin, is the end of the story today? Rhun has been
telling us this is a long running story,. Does this draw a line under
it? No, I think, as ron Davies said, devolution is a process.    as Ron
Davies said, devolution is a process. It is very easy for the
"no" campaign to scaremonger and say, "This is a step towards
greater powers for the Assembly" and it will only grow and grow, but
they are right on that. That is not necessarily a bad thing, inevitably
the next question is going to be tax raising powers and inevitably
that will come. If you are going to have an effective, self Government,
you need to give them the tools. This gives some of the tools to
have better Government and to deliver more accountable Government,
but for it to be really effective they have to have more fiscal
control over Wales so I think it is a going to be inevident thabl the
question of tax raising power    inevitable that the question of
tax raising powers will be raised in the future. Thank you. I want to
take you over to Swansea market, we will see what shoppers are up to
there. First, let's go over to Aberystwyth and where better to be
on a day like today than Aberystwyth. Our reporter is there
enjoying the sunshine. Hello. It is a lovely day here. Cardigan Bay in
all its glory is behind me. I'm joined with the Ceredigion
contingent of the People's Assembly. More than happy to share their
views. You live in a very isolated village. How relevant did you feel
this campaign was to you? Absolutely totally relevant to
everything. Politics affects us from cradle to grave. I can't think
of a single thing in my life that isn't governed in one way or
another by political decisions. is fair to say that maybe a large
part of the population has not shared your passion in this
particular referendum? I don't think I'm particularly passionate.
I'm an ordinary person. If they choose not to exercise the right
and the privilege of a vote, that is their problem. Pa tish ya, you
voted "no    Patricia, you voted "no" yes. Why? It was mainly on
finance. I understand that we only raise just over 30% of revenue of
what we receive under the Barnett Formula. I feel that if we are
giving so much power to the Welsh Assembly, because they will be
trying for more, that the main thing that I am fearing is the
English now are going to go for their Assembly and this will lead
certainly for them to wanting tax  raising powers as well. Isn't that
slightly outside of what the question was about this time?
but most people say that they can can see that this is what it is
leading to. And they feel that a lot of the "yes" voteers, it was
was    the "yes" voters, it was because they wanted to be loyal to
Wales. I think we are too small a country, we are just a blip and I
don't want to see anything split the United Kingdom. You are a
farmer, this area of Wales, farming is a very important industry. What
do you think about what Patricia is saying there? She made the point
about a small country and only a month ago I was in Luxembourg and
Liechtenstein and they are smaller. This isn't about independence, it
is about us having a bit of courage and doing the laws and in farming,
the farming laws, the farming rules are relevant for Wales and they are
not necessarily relevant for Scotland, Ireland, or England. And
we need a voice to represent us and to actually tailor it to the needs
of agriculture in Wales and we are not very happy with the situation
at the moment. We have heard your voices here today. Thank you for
your views. Now back to you in the studio. Thank you very much indeed.
Now, I think we are going to head over to Swansea market, while all
the politicians and journalists are running around on this very
important day, they think it is very important, back in the real
world, shoppers are doing their thing in Swansea market, as they do
every Friday morning. Our reporter is there. No doubt stocking up for
the weekend. How is it looking? Very good, Jamie. This is a place
well used to weighing things up, usually cockles, mussels, but today
political opinion and the desire to see those further and more direct
law making powers for the Assembly. Pauline works at the seafood store.
How is business today? Pretty good, yes. Everybody seems to be enjoying
the sun. Makes a difference, doesn't it? Sun even indoors, that
is a hell of a thing. Tell us now then, how much interest has there
been on your stall regarding this referendum? I haven't heard one
word. Not a word? Not one word, no. Nobody has discussed it. What is
responsible for that, then? I don't think a lot of people understood it,
what it all entails. Do you understand it? Well, I hope it will
be beneficial for Swansea, you know. I hope it will help Swansea and I
hope it will help the housing repairs and our hospitals.
would have liked to have had more information? More information is
needed. Who do you hold responsible for that lack of information?
I don't know... I suppose everybody in general, really. I think it
should have been made more beneficial to people. Do your
customers take an interest in Welsh politics, British politics?
really. This comes as no surprise? It doesn't. You voted? Yes, 8.00
yesterday morning. How did you vote, may I ask? Yes. How did you vote?
Yes. Why was that? Because I hope they will help to put more money in
housing and hospitals and help Swansea in general. You hope the
decisions that could be made in Cardiff will benefit the people of
Swansea? I do indeed. We seem to be left out of everything. Thank you
very much. Back to the day job. Come for a walk with me. We have
some more guests over here, some customers of the market today, some
who voted "yes" and some who voted "no". This place has 800 years of
history, maybe those politicians in the Bay, the chiefs of the Assembly,
could learn a few lessons as to how to survive the tests of time from
the stallholders here. David, you voted yesterday, which way? Yes, of
course, that was the only way to vote. Why was it the only way to
vote? When you have all the politicians agreeing on something,
and you know how little attention is given to matters relating to
Wales in Westminster, there isn't any other alternative. I looked at
the Times yesterday to see how much reference there was to the
referendum, and there was a line  and a half there. And then 20 lines
telling me Ann Widdecombe was taking part in a pantomime in
Wimbledon. You voted "no" yesterday, why? I think we have got plenty of
people in the Assembly at the moment. Why have another tier
again? They say there won't be, no more AMs? They say that. You wait,
there will be. To be quite honest, they have done nothing for me in
the last ten years. Absolutely nothing. So if they are going to
have another tier, what is going to happen? For the old people, schools
are closing, hospitals are closing, they... Thanks very much. I will
have to cut you mid stride. We will see how it pans out during the day.
Back to you in Cardiff. Thank you very much. I'm joined now by the
First Minister, Carwyn Jones. Thank you very much, First Minister, for
coming in to see us. What are your people telling us from around the
country? What news do you have for us? I only wish I had contacts
around the country. The picture is basically this. The turnout is in
the 30s, we suspect, not brilliant, but not apocalyptic, which some
people predicted. The news is very good. The turnout is low, the
reality is it is hardly the endorsement that people like you,
and other politicians, wanted, it is not a ringing endorsement?
points to make. When the London Assembly was established, it was
established on a turnout of 34%. Second, it isst nature and size of
the    it is the nature and size of the victory that is important. Some
will say it shows some difficulty in terms of the views of the
Assembly. Why are people so disengaged from Welsh politics? You
spent weeks on the road knocking doors, you have met people just the
same as I have, what are they telling you? Several reasons. First,
the fact there were no official campaigns, that is one thing that
people say to me. Campaigns don't mean anything? They do. Nobody
watches party election broadcasts, they switch over? I think you will
find that they do. There are a lot of people who do. The media
coverage from UK media was abysmal, there was hardly any coverage on
the BBC across the UK, no coverage at all in Fleet Street papers and
we know many people in Wales get their news... It is the media's
fault, not the politicians? media have got a lot to answer for,
at UK level, no question. Where was the coverage? It didn't exist. If
it had been London, there would have been far more coverage. People
like you, political parties, and a lot of people said to me the thing
is, I look at my school, I look at the underperformance of schools, I
look at the postcode lottery in health, I look at the economic
development in terms of the creation of jobs and the thing is,
they say, they don't think the Assembly has done a good job and
they have voted in this referendum, or not, and stayed away on that
landscape to their lives? That applies to Parliament as well. If
people are saying they don't like what the present UK Government is
doing, then the logical conclusion is therefore it is the fault of
Parliament, the fault of the institution. If people don't like
what the Assembly Government has been doing over the past four years,
they can express a view in May. It doesn't mean the whole institution
thinks the same way. There is a very active opposition here in the
Assembly. Schools are run by local authorities, let's make that clear
as well. You must walk away with some sense that politicians need to
deliver more, you must walk away from a turnout figure in the 30s
where you go home tonight and think Politicians always need to deliver
more. Fought the election in May, all parties will be putting forward
their ideas for Wales in their manifestos. That is the way I think
politics should be concluded. In terms of drafting a manifesto, it
would be difficult to do that in terms of no vote. We would be
saying to people, we would like to do this but we have to wait for
Westminster to give us the go ahead. We are looking for no excuses
culture as well. First Minister, thank you very much indeed for
talking to us. Now, with the times that    the
time at 11:30am, you are watching BBC One Wales, Referendum 2011. Now
time for a news summary. Good morning, counting is under way
in a referendum on whether the Assembly should have direct law 
making powers. Early indications suggest that turnout might be low
with Merthyr reporting figures of attend    29th cent turnout.
Counting is taking place in all 22 local authorities with the result
expected this afternoon. The campaign for yes vote so they are
confident they will get the right result. We are disappointed about
the turnout but I think we are looking forward seeing a positive
vote today and I want to pay tribute at the outset to the hard 
working volunteers who have campaigned for yes campaign over
the last couple of months. Meanwhile, the main No campaigners,
True Wales, say they do not think they have convinced the electorate
of their case. They say the referendum should have been heard
years ago. It is looking as if we have not succeeded in getting no
vote. We are very concerned about turnout. They needed to be a high
turnout. We fear that this campaign has not captured the public
imagination. We regret that politicians narrowed this down to a
technical matter rather than discussing the devolution journey
as a whole and talking about how this would impact on people's lives,
referring to things like education, health and the economy which is
struggling at the moment. With the turnout expected to be low, we have
had some more figures coming in to us with 34.6 % income and tough,
39.4 % in... We are expecting a result from Swansea at around 1
o'clock. I will be back in an hour. Stay with us for continuing
coverage of the referendum result A warm welcome back to Cardiff Bay
and Referendum 2011. That is the story so far this morning. I am
joined by BBC Wales Parliamentary correspondent, David Cornock. How
will this play out with MPs in London? They will be watching what
is going on? What will they be making of it? It is fair to say
they are watching but it is also fair to say they have not been that
engaged in the campaign. Many resisted the opportunity during
half term week to postpone fact  finding missions. It is fair to say
a lot of Labour MPs were sceptical about the idea of a referendum and
did not want to give up that role in scrutinising requests for
legislation. Everything changed in May last year when the government
changed and the Labour argument and they represent most MPs in Wales,
has been that this mode can now protect the Assembly from some of
the worst excesses, they would sit of the coalition government in
Westminster. The last place to have a referendum was London, your home.
There are similarities, by the look of it, turnout figures? Yes, if you
look back to the London referendum in 1998 which set up the mayor of
London, now Boris Johnson, formerly Ken Livingstone, that 10 out there
was just 34 %. In many ways that was a more substantial political
change to the technical change that this referendum will usher in. If
you stick to the technical nature of the question. There is a lot of
relief from yes campaign that the 10 out looks like it will be higher
than they perhaps feared. Stay put because we have got more to talk
about. We will talk further in a few moments. We can have a word
from Rhun ap Iorwerth. What have you got for us? On the turnout
figures, just confirming what David was saying. It is that stage of the
day where I still have scribbles on a piece of paper. Just picking out
a few figures. This was the result in 1997, Flintshire, turnout was a
very low. The figure we have now is 29 %. A 12 % drop. A couple of
others I could mention, I could mention Blaenau Gwent. That had a
10 out just under 50 % last time, we are hearing this time around 32
%. That is the biggest drop, 17 %. This map is interesting. We can
shade this map in according to where turnout was at its greatest.
The deeper the colour, the greater the turnout. We have some turnout
figures already. For the Isle of Anglesey, 44 % this time. I make it,
on that kind of pattern, maybe a 15 % drop through about the whole of
Wales which keeps it in the mid 30s which is better than some had
feared. Thank you very much. I'm just hearing that we may be a few
minutes off from our first count. As soon as we have that, we will
take you there. We are going to head off to Denbighshire in the
next few minutes and see what is going on there. We will also go to
Neath Port Talbot because we have some developments there. First of
all, I think we were head over to the Senedd where some big hitters
are waiting to talk to us. Next he    let's see who Beth and Lewis is
joined by now. Thank you. I am joined by two very experienced
figures, the former leader of the Welsh Conservatives and Ron Davies,
a former Welsh Secretary who drove that first referendum campaign back
in 1997. First of all, Roger, your feelings about what is happening
today? The referenda are quite different. In 1997 there was
clarity on the issue, do you want devolution or not? The question
yesterday was far more complicated. As we understand, half the
electorate did not feel that they had sufficient information to come
to a decision. Has it been less exciting and less interesting?
much less interesting. All of the political parties were campaigned  
  were united in yes campaign. The No campaign were run by amateurs at
the game. The difference in the campaigns were quite start. In
terms of resources, certainly, because yes vote had all the
resources of all the political parties whereas the no campaign
were dependent basically on handouts. A very different campaign
this time? Yes, I spent most of yesterday trying to dissuade people
to vote yesterday. There was a degree of uncertainty about the
issue. There was no clear cut principle. It was a detailed
constitutional argument about the process by which legislation was
passed. It was difficult to get people to be motivated. Back in
1997, maybe before that, you coined the phrase process not an event, in
terms of devolution, has that process finished? I think by a
definition processes cannot finish. This is another important step but
things will go forward. I have to say that in one of today's Welsh
language newspapers, Ron is calling for tax paid and powers already.
I'm not calling for tax raising powers at all. You can never
discount what will happen in the future and it is foolish for people
to say the constitution will not develop. The British constitution
has had 1,000 years to develop. Even in the present session of
Parliament their constitutional changes. So the paper was wrong
with the headline that you want tax raising powers? Do you or don't
you? I thought you were a pundit and not a politician. That is why I
am asking you. I have not read the paper yet. Can I ask you, the No
campaign's argument was it was all about more than a question but a
slippery slope to independence, do you agree with that? I do agree
with that because what they are being asked to do is to give the
Welsh Assembly Government independence from Westminster
within those 20 areas for which we have devolution. It is an
independent issue in terms of legislation. What about you? Long
term, this goes much further than the result of the referendum, were
of the No campaign right? No, the No campaign were dishonest. They
said in the debate about the present referendum we should be
discussing long term constitutional issues that tax raising powers,
like the number of Assembly Members, this referendum was that none of
that. This referendum was about improving the way the National
Assembly operates at the moment. It is why all the political parties
and many people from outside or campaigning for a Yes vote. It is
about improving our democracy, the way we take that issue forward, the
way policies are developed will be a matter for future debate.
there were to be no vote today, the process, as you describe so
eloquently 12 years ago, would have stopped dead in its tracks. No it
would not. If you look at the way Westminster legislation evolves,
you have a new acts passing, that prices would have continued anyway.
We could have a substantial overwhelming Yes vote today but
even if they had have been no vote, the process would have gone on.
Roger thinks there would be an overwhelming Yes vote, how do think
it is going? The opinion polls show they will be 82 One vote for yes.
What about the turnout, any problem with legitimacy? I have a benchmark
in my mind for the vote for mayor of London which Grandstand was 34 %.
If we are there or thereabouts it will not be too embarrassing   
which I understand was 34 %. Thank you for joining me. Isn't it good
to see those people back on the TV, two bruisers from our political
past. We could get them on as contestants in a show. We are about
five minutes away from a result in Blaenau Gwent. They have cleared
the stage and a man has tapped the microphone to make sure it works.
We may have our first result. We think we will be able to tell you
what will happen then a few moments. We have just heard that
Pembrokeshire turnout 38 %, a 44 % in Carmarthen. David Cornock
watching that interview with run Davies and Rod Richards. The de
vous    v devolution debate will go on and on. If there is a Yes vote,
the UK government will set out the commission that will look at the
way the Assembly is funded and whether, like Scotland, it should
have more power to raise its own money. You have an offer from the
UK government today, for the power to create St David's Day as a bank
holiday in Wales. Ron Davies was right, it is a process, not an
event. I think we will head over to our reporter who is waiting to talk
to us. First of all, we will go to Denbighshire where our reporter
Robert Thomas is ready to talk to us. Any idea on turnout and how far
are you off at a hard result? are very close to a result. As far
as we know, the counting has been completed and we are waiting for
the signal for the vote to be announced. The turnout is down from
50 % at the referendum in 1997. The people are saying the result this
time in Denbighshire is the exact opposite of what we had in 1997.
Then it was a 60 40 split in favour of no vote. This time they are
saying they are confident of a Yes vote. They are guessing it has gone
60 44 Yes vote this time in Denbighshire. The result is due any
moment now. Rhodri Morgan said this morning about how strong the postal
vote had been. Here in Denbighshire, 64 % of postal ballots have been
returned. That is getting on for the figures you would see in some
general elections. The overall figure, 34.5, which is pretty much
what Rhun ap Iorwerth was saying in terms of the change in the vote
from 1997, down roughly from 50 % to the mid 30s. We are expecting
We will not miss any of the counts. You will see them all up live on
BBC One Wales on Referendum 2011. The time is 11:45am. I would just
give you a summary so that you know what is going on. You are watching
live coverage of all of the counts on Referendum 2011. We have no
results for you yet. As you can probably sense, we are going to be
getting results quickly. Counting is continuing across Wales. Turnout,
in the 30s. First results expected in the next five minutes or so.
Average turnout so far, we do not have all the figures up, but this
is what we are looking at so far, it is around 35%. That is going to
change as the rest of the figures come in. To explain, there are 22
counts all around the country, results are going to be announced
by officers and collated in Cardiff. A second announcement will be
repeating the announcement in Cardiff Bay. That is the story so
far. Let us go to another one of the counts. Let us go in a few
minutes to our reporter in Neath Port Talbot. I am joined now by our
political editor, Betsan Powys. You have been talking to the campaigns
and you are getting an official bits and bobs. I have been out in
the sunshine and I have told to a lot of people. I bump into Carwyn
Jones. I asked him if it is a new     a good morning for Wales? He said
that I would have to wait later to hear from him. Plaid Cymru have
said that they have got their vote. We Ness, 70% yes. Carmarthen, 65%.
A very happy Leighton Andrews. Another says that they have a
feeling in their gut that they are OK. Nick Bourne is a wound, he is
reasonably happy.    around. If the figure is around mid 30s for the
turnout, people will be very relieved. I want to take you to
another one of the counts now. Let us go to Neath Port Talbot. How far
are you off being able to tell us about an announcement?
Quite a long wait. Counting has only just started within the last
10 minutes. You can see about 80 counters behind me. They have only
just started within the last 10 minutes. We are a little way of the
announcement I am afraid. For those of you who remember, in 1997 it was
Neath Port Talbot that had the highest Yes vote. Over half the
electorate turned out and have the two thirds were to do yes. It would
be interested to put    interesting to see whether voters had regained
the top spot. The MP for Neath has what into the buildings. Peter hame
the Secretary of State    Peter Hain. He hopes we will get a
positive result today. In 1997, we had a strong Yes vote. We have
Peter hame who has been at the forefront of the campaign, very
much Mr up Referendums. On the other hand, if we do not see a
resounding Yes vote, turnout up his act 38% this time. That is less
than last time. If the Yes vote it does not come strong here,
obviously it is... Difficult questions will be asked. Counting
has just got under way. We are not expecting the announcement any time
soon. That will be in a couple of hours. Go and get yourself a
sandwich and we will come back to you much later. We are much closer
on many of these counts. We think we are going to be able to tell you
the counts in a number of local authorities within the next couple
of minutes. Stay with us. Watch it live. Well we are waiting for our
first result, let us have a look with Rhun ap Iopwerth. We have
asked what happened between the 1979 referendum and 1987. Before
the assembly had event been set up, it was a roller coaster. The
political debates leading up to the passing of the Wales Act 1998, that
was the Secretary of State Ron Davies, sitting on the steps in the
House of Lords as they finished off the steps to becoming law. Then of
course you had the controversy over his personal life, his moment of
madness, that open the door eventually and surprisingly to Alan
Michael, becoming the first Secretary of State for Wales.
Labour did not have a majority in those days. It cost him his job.
Eventually, Rhodri Morgan became the Labour leader in Wales. He
formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. One part of that
coalition deal was a an agreement to set up the Richard Commission,
the future of devolution. It reported in 2004, recommending a
new system of government, a separate executive with full law 
making powers. As it happened, Labour decided... No, we are not
going to have that. They decided to draw up their own recommendations.
We will continue the history lesson later. Do we have a result? Surrey
to stop you in full flow. I am being shouted out.    Surrey. We
will go in just a few moments to Blaenau Gwent. Wish to do the empty
stage a little earlier on. We watched a man pulling a sound
check... The number of ballot papers counted by the is 17,257.
The number of votes cast for a scrum at 11,816 I. The number of
votes cast in favour of the Earl is Thank you.
It is a Yes vote in Blaenau Gwent. They claim their rightful place as
the first local authority in Wales to declare. There are the hard
figures. A turnout of 32%. We have been talking about the magic 30
figure all morning. 69% yes, 39%    31% know. Betsan Powys, first
reaction? I had heard the rumour at the Senedd. Asia has a swing
towards the Yes campaign    it shows. They were not entirely sure
what would happen. Last time Peter Law was their leading the way and
it was thought he had played a big role. This time, Labour it
delighted. An area that they are getting back in there and regaining
electorally, a 69 31% that it is one that they are delighted with. I
think we can safely say that the MNs is very clear.    at the Ullman
is clear. Let us have a look at the change. It is a swing to yes. This
is based on the last referendum in 1997. A 13% swing to yes. They were
not be many tears in political party to see a change into and out,
a reduction of 70%? No, I know you have discussed turnout. The feeling
is that in this sort of referendum, a technical referendum, a difficult
issue for people to comprehend, nobody seems terribly surprised. I
think they will be celebrating the results rather than being too
concerned about the turnout. It has cost to the Senedd. The news is
being watched by people in the Senedd. People from all political
parties. This was the reaction when the announcement came through. The
well recognised many of the faces. Leighton Andrews, would do us. It
is one result. Can you read anything from the first result?
think on this occasion, I am going to say yes you can. It is tying in
with everything we are hearing from elsewhere in Wales. We are going to
head in just a few moments to the editor of the Swansea Evening Post.
He is waiting to talk to us. In the meantime, if you are just joining
us, you're watching live coverage of the referendum 2011, all of the
results live as they happen. In the 22 counts, all around the country,
you will see it all here alive. I will be joined by our political
editor of Betsan Powys and also Rhun ap Iopwerth, crunching the
figures for us. Let us go to Swansea market where our reporter
is standing by to talk to us. You are an avid daytime TV viewer,
you will be familiar with part cut, can't cook. You are the editor of
the South Wales Evening Post? What are you expecting? I am expecting a
fairly low turnout. Swansea will vote less, at a ratio of 2 1.   
will vote yes. In 1997, Swansea voted in favour of establishing the
assembly. The pattern will be followed. The further west we go,
the stronger the support for the referendum. Tell us what stance
your paper has taken during the campaign? We have taking a neutral
position, we have not recommended to our readers to vote either way.
I thought the most important thing we can do is to fill the
information gap and then let them decide how well indeed if they
wanted to do it. Have you succeeded considering that many many people
out there are not convinced? They are not convinced that they know
what is going on? I think we have succeeded in providing the
information. Time will tell whether people have taken that on board. I
do not think it is the case that the question people have been asked
is complicated, it is simply technical. Ms people are not
engaged with it.    most people. Thank you very much. They have just
announced the result in Denbighshire. I hereby give notice
that I have certified the following to be chief counting officer. The
number of ballot papers can to buy me is 25,000. The number of votes
cast in favour of the S is 15,793.    in favour of the S. The number
of votes... Then we are, it is AES in Denbighshire. That is the second
announcement in Referendum 2011. It is a majority of 6000, 62% yes, 38%
know. Turnout, 34%. That is our second announcement. Let me just
show you what that means in terms of the change from the referendum
in 1997. It is a swing to yes of 21%. That is a thumping. The
political component    political commentator is with me now. You
have always got to be careful on days like today, elections, up
referendums, to start reading too much into anything? You do,
especially when they are geographically and in terms of the
previous referendum, I am a little bit reluctant to turn    to talk
about swings, you're not comparing like with like, they were asked
different questions. There is one area in North East Wales that has
traditionally looked towards England as much as towards Cardiff.
That is significant. Can I just tell you that if you're watching in
the Merthyr area, we are hearing that there is a partial recount in
Merthyr, I do not know anything else about it at the moment. As
soon as we do no more, we will take you have a to mouth. This is the
scene in the affair. It is going to be a recount, or we do not know how
much. As soon as I know more about There are a few thoughts now, we do
not have any patterns that the moment. A couple of results and. I
just a where we are compared with 1997, Blaenau Gwent, the turnout
this time, 32 % which is lower than last time. If it is nice to compare
where Blaenau Gwent ranks in terms with yes vote now and yes vote in
1997. If we look at the result in 1997, if Blaenau Gwent is voting
yes at 69 % this time, there are counties last time which voted with
a stronger Yes vote. Thank you very much indeed. Are you going to be
able to call it in terms of turnout and results? Not at this stage!
That would be foolish. The signs are very clear. You have your
reputation to think of? This, but I think the signs are about 32 or 35
%. A fairly resounding 2 One vote in terms of yes. We are on safe
territory now. This day with us, we will talk later. If you are
wondering, why have they not come to our neck of the woods, we will
be coming to where you live in an     the next hour or so. There are 22
counts taking place. I want to take you now have to our reporter Kieran
Jenkins. He is among the hard working counters. What news do you
have? The main part of the counting has finished here in Klan get me.
We saw big stacks on the tables to my left. It is not snazzy as your
graphics but they have been doing account themselves and you can see
more or less how the result is going. It will be at least 2 1 in
favour of a Yes vote. It is interesting this result in Ynys Mon
because in 1997 it was the most representative result in the whole
of Wales. A very narrow victory for the Yes camp at that time. Their
looks like it is a different result, they have extended their lead here.
Eight will be    there will be one very interested observer, Ieuan Wyn
Jones who is the Deputy First Minister. He is the leader of Plaid
Cymru. Central to know    the negotiating team of Clyde come was
this referendum which is being played that day    the team of
Plaid Cymru. This is going on in his backyard. Turnout looks like
being above average in terms of the turnout nationwide. He will be
pleased with that. He will probably be pleased with the result which
looks like 60 40 in favour of a Yes vote. We will be straight back
there as soon as we have a hard result for you. I want to whisk you
down out to the Welsh coast. We can go over to Ceredigion next where we
are joined by our reporter Simon Pusey who may have some news for us.
What news D bring? Thank you, you join me here at the leisure centre.
The turnout has been 44 %, higher than is expected across Wales. What
you see are a number of people standing up. They all Yes
campaigners. No No campaigners that I have seen. From what I have seen,
they are pretty positive they will get a result here and the result
will go their way from the surveys there have been doing. They are
pretty confident. A result here is expected at around 1 o'clock.
you, Simon. You can see the picture. It has just gone midday and we are
expecting a substantial amount of these results to come in in the
next hour or so. Stay with us, where you live, we will be bringing
you the latest as it happens from your part of the country. Professor
Laura McAllister is still with me. It was interesting talking to the
First Minister early on this morning. He made a quite pronounced
attack on the UK media for failing to probably cover this referendum.
I suggested to him it was also the fault of politicians because
perhaps the public were not engaged in the way they should be. What
about that point about the UK media not covering this referendum
campaign? And the bafflement on the part of ordinary voters wondering
what it is all about? I have had e  mails from people saying they did
not understand the campaign and they did not know how to vote. A
lot of people said they did not get information. We must talk about the
campaign and the problem within formation, getting the story over.
I think in terms of engaging the public in terms of the mechanics of
the debate. They needed to be two sides which were articulate and had
evenly matched resources. We simply did not have that. I think, in
fairness, some blame has to go on the No side, True Wales in
particular, for not wanting to become an official campaign and
draw down resources for that. It is extremely difficult to get
information out there. Equally, I think the UK media has shown a
pretty strong disregard for anything which is happening around
an important constitutional issue in Wales. There has been no
coverage as far as I can see in the UK media, particularly the press. I
think that is disturbing bear in mind where most Welsh people digest
their news from. We should mention that most people get their news
from newspapers which are published in London, the Mirror, the Sun and
the Daily Mail and so on. Absolutely. I felt sorry for you
guys in BBC Wales but also some of the newspapers like the Western
Mail who at least tried to promote the debate through their front
pages but they are reaching a very tiny audience. There is no wonder
that people have been confused about what to vote on. Don't feel
sorry for us, we are very well fed. I think we can go over to Swansea.
Our reporter has been watching the count there. Any news, how far are
we off a result? Any news on the turn out? I reckon we will get a
result between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock. They have just restarted
counting after verifying the big total. Now they are working their
way through the s and no piles. One fact few before rumours, the
turnout was 32.9 %, that reflects the general pattern across Wales.
It is far lower than the turnout in 1997 when 47 % of Swansea voters
decided to vote. Now for the rumours, it seems as if in some
areas of Swansea, two thirds of voters backed the call for further
powers to the Assembly with one  third voting No. In places like the
Gower peninsula, it seems to have been more evenly spread, the result.
The other pattern we are seeing in Swansea is the more Welsh speaking
areas towards the north of the county have backed the call for
further powers, bit more than the English speaking areas to the south
of the county. They are the pattern we are beginning to see. Why
Swansea is interesting in the context of the day, might be the
comparison between the vote here and the vote in the Big Brother,
Cardiff. Swansea voted for an Assembly in 1997, Cardiff voted
against. There was a bit of disappointment in Swansea. You have
seen the economy in Swansea developing slower than Cardiff.
Disappointment in Swansea that the pledge they gave to house a
national Assembly when they were struggling to find a building in
Cardiff was rejected out of hand, if you like. I don't know whether
the little sister or little brother complex might pan out in these
votes in Swansea. Thank you. We will be straight back to in Swansea,
just as soon as we have word of a result there. I think we will go
over to Monmouthshire now. A very interesting part of Wales because
of its voting record in the past, both in Assembly elections and the
referendum in previous decades. We can talk to our reporter there.
Hello. Hello, Jamie. Monmouthshire should be an interesting place to
watch for whatever reason, however the result ends up turning out. It
was the place that was most hostile to devolution back in 1997. 67 % of
people voted against having an Assembly so you would imagine it is
the toughest nut for yes campaign to crack this time round. Not a lot
that I can tell you about what to expect. Huw Edwards, the former
Monmouth MP and Janet Davies, the former Plaid Cymru eight AM, both
think it is going quite well. Janet Davies said she has been observing
the number of boxes coming out over 50 % for the Yes camp. The question
is, whether those boxers tend to be the significant ones. It is
difficult to get an indication of how the result will be. What I
think is clear, we can expect a lower turnout, we have a 35.8 %
turnout here, as opposed to 50 %, back in 1997. You might expect the
Yes camp to get their vote out. The No campaign are not
professionalised in terms of having named politicians for example. It
is interesting the role the Conservatives have or have not
played in this referendum. Back in 1997, Monmouthshire was then a Tory
stronghold. The Conservatives were very much to the fore of the No
campaign in 1997. This time around, it is not the case. The Tory party
in the Assembly is very much in favour of a Yes vote and Nick
Ramsay, the local AM in Monmouth is in favour of the estate and he has
done an awful lot to get information about the referendum
out, not so much to persuade people to vote yes, but he is open about
the fact it is his preference, as to make sure people are Clear and
understand what they will be voting on. On the other hand, David Davis,
perhaps the most famous naysayer to devolution in Wales, certainly
among the MPs, although he has made it clear that he is in favour of no
vote, he does not want yes vote to go ahead, he has not been shouting
it from the rooftops. He has put a detailed explanation of his
position on his website which is there for anyone to see, but he has
not been campaigning stringently. Whether that will make a difference,
whether it will allow yes vote to become closer, that will be
interesting. Thank you very much. As soon as there is a result in
Monmouthshire, we will be straight back there. Coming up in the next
10 minutes or so, we will also whizzy across to the Senedd. All
sides in the political debate are gathering in the building behind me
to wait and watch the results coming through and see how their
individual campaigns have gone. You will see it all here live on BBC
One Wales. I'm joined by the political editor Laura McAllister
again. I wonder what lessons each of the political parties will take
away from today? Presumably, the post mortem starts tomorrow for
those people who have been troubled. There will be a lot of soul 
searching in at least two of the political parties? It has been an
odd one. It does not mean that all of the troops are of one mind, in
terms of supporting the referendum Yes campaign, but nevertheless, the
party unity between the four of them has been quite substantial and
considerable. I think that will disintegrate now. Once this has
been done and dusted, we going to an election period where the
parties will be tweaking their manifestos depending on the way the
result goes today. If it goes in favour of a Yes vote and they have
powers over the devolved areas, they will be tweaking their
manifestos to reflect the legislative manifesto they expect
to see. What does that mean in the real world but in terms of jobs and
They have the legal capacity to look at how the areas developed.
There will be an enormous amount of party politics coming into
decisions over health and education. From here on in, there will be no
explicit    excuses. They have control even if not the whole
funding that they would like. Thank you very much.
You are watching Referendum 2011. It is 1215. These are the story so
far: the first results are in. You have seen it live here as it
happened. Many more to come. We will bring you them as they happen.
Blaenau Gwent says yes. A big cheer up in Blaenau Gwent. And also
Denbighshire, they said yes. A partial recount in Merthyr Tydfil.
I do not know any more about that. We do not know how much able
partial recount his, whether or not they are going to do lots of it and
which will did Blake    delay the count by hours or minutes. We will
take you straight there as soon as we know more. We only have a
handful of results so far. This figure has to be treated with
slight caution, but I think it is a useful figure to look at, average
turnout is 35%. Those are the headlines from Referendum 2011. Do
not forget that that the cancer in all 22 of the areas    all of the
cancer will be announced here live.    Counts let us go to the Senedd.
Our reporter Bethan Lewis is joined by the campaigners who are watching
the results coming in on the lovely sunny afternoon in Cardiff Bay.
is very sunny and getting quite one here in the sun. I am joined by two
people who have been campaigning very energetically for a Yes vote
over the last few weeks. From Plaid Cymru and Yes for Wales. Your
reaction? I am very pleased. If you had asked me baby to go at whether
we could get a majority in Denbighshire, I would have said No
If. It is a good sign that we have. A substantial step    substantial
swing from the last referendum. It is early days but I think
Denbighshire is a positive sign. I am not surprised at the Blaenau
Gwent result. We are pleased. results in line with what you were
expecting? The opinion polls have been consistent for three years. We
were never sure whether or not that would be translated into votes in
the ballot box. A 20% swing in Denbighshire seems to suggest that
Wales has changed since 1997. Our point was that it was a commonsense
argument. It made sense. The challenge we have had is getting
through to people to get them to think about it. 80 a knack of 35%
shows that we have failed to get through to a lot of people    a
turnout. But it is a constitutional issue and that is hard to fight a
referendum on. It is a similar turn out to the turn up in the but for
the London there are. There for nobody questioned that legitimacy
and nobody should question the legitimacy of this. Do you think it
is enough? We would have preferred a much higher turnout but for
various reasons, we have been frustrated by our message to get
the message out. We have printed over 1.5 million leaflets.
Obstacles have been put in our wake. We know that most people get their
news from London based sources. True Wales tried its best to get
the message across. We could have done better. It is enough. Part of
the challenge for people is to get all of the parties to work together
in this campaign, the Conservatives as a party were not fully pro yes.
But in the assembly the AMs have been. How have you found it in your
area? When you have been campaigning hard against each other
in the Assembly elections? thought it would be more of a
problem than it was. It is helpful that the Labour MP has always been
a pro devolution. We were able to set up a joint committee and also
involve the Liberal Democrats and the greens. We have done a lot of
work together. The truth is that most of the work on the ground was
done by Plaid Cymru activists. There were Labour people out there
too. It was a positive message to the people in Llanelli having their
MP from one party and AM from another party working together,
saying the system does not what, let's sort it out and simplified.
The gloves will be off tomorrow morning. We look forward to that.
Behind the scenes, they must have been issues, conflict, tensions
between the parties? It must have been a challenge? We anticipated
that it would be a lot more difficult than it was. To fight a
referendum so close to the elections, that would be difficult.
The fights have stained behind the scenes. There has been a unity of
purpose. It is an example that should be carried on be on the
referendum. We are going to have more powers, if there is a Yes vote
today, this is no magic bullet, it is a process change. The problems
we have remain and we need the unity of purpose that we have seen
in the referendum campaign. That is what this must be about, making
Wales better. Thank you. It is a glorious day in
Cardiff Bay, look at that. You would think it was the middle of
summer, unless you were outside. It is very chilly. The story is not
just happening in Cardiff of course, it is a Wills wide referendum. In
the next couple of minutes I will be taking you to Haverfordwest.   
miles wide. First of all, too, are then. Our reporter is into the
Leslie.    is in Carmarthen. Do you know what time the result will be
in? Not yet. We were optimistic thinking it would be at around
12:30pm. But they are still counting behind me. We are hearing
that they are confident of a Yes vote. 65 70%, they are saying.
There are 28,000 postal votes counted with a Yes vote of 70%.
Quite confident of a Yes vote. Some were its, places like the Amman
Valley, they are saying up to 80% Yes vote. It is looking like a Yes
vote but we do not know when the result will be in. It is, I must
say, one of the highest turnouts here, 44.36 %. Once again, come are
then producing a very high turnout.    Carmarthenshire.
I have been joined by a Ieuan Wyn Jones and Richard Jones from
Cardiff University. I know you will want to know what is going on in
temperature because it is always much more important than speaking
to you, fascinating as you are. Let us go to Haverfordwest. What is the
story? I think you are a little bit
biased! Welcome to this school will. As you can see, the Count is fairly
quiet. I believe that it is coming to declare his now. We have the
turnout and the result. Bitter and a we already know in Pembrokeshire,
38.7%. Higher than was expected. In the reference    run up to the
referendum, the campaign has been low key. You got the feeling that
people were not that engaged in the debate. Turnout of 38.7%. Some
areas of temperature have had a higher turnout than others. Pockets
of the North Pembrokeshire have had a very high turnout. And a small
town, the a population of 500, almost all turned up to vote. As
for the result, Adams and about an hour ago, it looked as if it was
too close to call. It looks as though it is heading towards a yes
over it. The figures are being sent to Cardiff to verification. We will
know shortly the result. Let us talk now to Ieuan Wyn Jones, the
Deputy First Minister and Richard Jones from Cardiff University. Let
us start with what you know. What are your people telling you? Your
Plaid Cymru people have been knocking to us and walking
pavements for weeks. What is the story? Unfortunately, I have had to
put all of my electronic equipment off to speak to you. Yes, it is a
security thing. What I can say is that the reports that are receive
before this interview a extremely encouraging. The results are in and
I think they are similar projections being made in a number
of other counties. I think we can safely say that they would be a
mainly    major upset if it were a No vote. A democrat like you, and I
have no new since you were an MP when we both had more hair, the
reality is that they Democrat like you, who loves democracy, will
really not take any pleasure whatsoever in seeing turnout this
low. It is not the slap on the back, the endorsement, that people like
you and the people that work in the place behind me, need. I can
understand why you want to concentrate on the turnout... Let
us talk about the results as well. The result is a conclusive one in
relation to the way people feel. I think you can take also the fact
that referendums generally, and for example, the setting up of the
London Assembly had a turnout of around 30s, they tend not to have
major turnouts. One of the reasons that the Liberal Democrats once the
a the referendum on the same day as the local elections is to up the
turnout. The campaigns were low key. As you have heard, we have had to
print a million leaflets to deliver door to door. Generally speaking,
that information would normally be sent through the post. We have to
look at a legislation. You can't say that one side can prevent
another side from campaigning effectively. Lots of people will
say that you can have party  political broadcasts, things
through your letterbox, the reality is there nobody not party political
broadcasts and people of the things that come through the letterbox
into the bin. That is not true. The survey done earlier asking where do
people get their information from? It is interesting. They get it from
people like you, local press and literature that comes through the
door. This time, there was not a great deal of any of that, to be
perfectly honest. No doubt, you will be teaching the
story of Referendum 2011 to lots of that students very soon indeed.
What is the story that you will be teaching them I wonder? Two things.
In terms of the results, it shows that devolution has become part of
the furniture. What is particularly striking about this is that we are
seeing bigger yes votes in places like Denbighshire... It has become
part of the furniture for some people. The turnout, what is clear
is that it is not part of the furniture for a substantial number
of people in Wales. It is. In terms of the turnout, I have to say that
I was one of those people who always thought that this is not the
referendum we should be having. It is on a technical choice between
two systems of primary law making power. That is not the kind of
thing that gets the juices flowing. There are be for us, but for most
sensible people, this is a narrow technical choice. It was never
going to be grabbing the attention of people. Certainly, there is the
issue of a map as Ieuan Wyn Jones fairly points out, we do not have a
serious campaign because of the constraints of electoral law. The
final point, the opinion polls have been showing an average yes lead of
over 20 points for a year. That is again the kind of thing that
depresses Dannatt. It is interesting that, up for example in
Switzerland, they have referendums all the time, a low turnout when
the result is none. People are happy enough. I am going to stop
you as you get towards Switzerland. They have had three had a and 50.
You are watching BBC One Wales and the Referendum 2011. We have only
had a handful of results. We can update you with the latest
headlines. Good afternoon. As you have been
hearing, referendum results have started to come in with Blaenau
Gwent the first to declare. It saw a row landing    a resounding Yes
vote. The number of ballot papers candour by the 17,257. The number
of votes cast in favour of a yes, 11,000... Turnout in the area was
only 32 %. Results are expected fairly soon from Bridgend and
Wrexham. There is also a rechecking of votes in Merthyr Tydfil. The
First Minister said that despite the average turnout of 35.8 % so
far, the result was still valid. When the London Assembly was
established, it was established on a turnout of 34 %. Secondly, it is
the nature and size of the victory which is important. Some will say
it shows difficulty in terms of the Assembly. If people did not won the
Assembly, they would have turned out in their droves to vote No.
Turnout has varied from 44 % in Carmarthenshire to 22 % in Newport.
Experts say the low turnout is due to the referendum being called over
a technical issue. It was not symbolic enough for to win people's
interest. We should not beat ourselves up in Wales. We have the
same effect in London. Only a third of the population turned out to say
whether they should have a mayor or not. While there are specific Welsh
issues here, there are wider issues. People are not that interested in
politics any more. Don't forget, whilst today at 1:30pm from the
Senedd and all the results as they come in on BBC One Wales    Wales
today at 1:30pm. A very warm welcome back to Cardiff
Bay on Friday. This is the scene here on the most gorgeous March day.
A wonderful blue sky and incidentally, normally I would
guess that if you were switching on BBC One you would be expecting to
see Bargain Hunt. They are taking a day off. We are bringing you all
the results live from Referendum 2011. All the results from all the
22 counts and you will see it all here life. We have had a handful
here already. We may be able to bring you a couple more results in
the next few minutes. I am joined in the studio by Professor Richard
Wynne Jones from Cardiff University. We will talk to him about the
result so far and the analysis. We have a lot to talk about in terms
of who has voted, who has not, turnout and all the rest of it.
Rhun ap Iorwerth, our political correspondent is here and he has
been watching the results as they cumin. Yes, only a couple of
results so far. The can look at the results we do have. Him Blaenau
Gwent and Denbighshire and a quick look at the swings. This win in
Blaenau Gwent since the last    the last referendum in 1997 is a big
swing of 13 %. Up in Denbighshire which voted No in 1997, it really
is a substantial swing. Both of them on a small turnout, around 30
% but a very substantial swing. I can now add up the total votes for
Blaenau Gwent and Denbighshire. We can bring you a tally. That is the
result as it stands, 27,000 yes, 15,000, no. That is a 17 % swing
since the 1997 referendum. It is early days so maybe we should not
look for patterns from two results. But what I can tell you is
Denbighshire was a strong no as Blaenau Gwent was a strong Yes in
1997 Sobey of cancelling themselves out. Both with a similar drop in
turnout from 50 sent to 20. Thank you indeed. I'm just hearing that
in a few moments, we can take you to our next count. We think we may
have a result in just a few moments. It is in Wrexham. We will take you
there. Apologies if an hour chat with Rachel Banner and Bethan Lewis
in the Senedd is interrupted. Wrexham is declaring now so we will
go straight there. I hereby give notice that I have
certified the following to the chief counting officer. The number
of ballot papers counted by me is 27,469. The number of votes cast in
favour of yes is 17,606. The number of votes cast in favour of know it
is 9863.    in favour of no. So, it is a Yes vote in Wrexham by
quite a substantial majority. You can see the figures. A turnout of
27 %. That will be disappointing for both sides of this campaign. I
can show you the swing, the change on the 1997 referendum. A move to
the yes of 19 %, that is the change on the 1997 referendum. A drop in
turnout on 1997 of 16 %. That will not be welcomed in any quarter, I
would not a Maj Gen. Professor Richard Wyn Jones from Cardiff
University is with me watching back results come in. That is a big
swing. This was part of Wales where if you spoke privately to yes
campaigners, it was a part of Wales they were worried about. That is a
very comfortable Yes vote. A 19. Swing. I think there is a tendency
because we have seen large swings. That is big in political terms. The
turnout, we discussed turn out earlier. The turnout was never
going to be high. In this particular corner of Wales, you
would expect it to be even lower. There will be a lot of people there
who do not watch you on television, amazingly enough, and do not read
Welsh papers and are not engaged in Welsh affairs. The demographics of
that area has also changed in the last few years. A lot of population
moving into that part of Wales from across the border. We should not be
surprised by the low turnout. I think what should surprise us is
the extent of the Yes vote. No aye, are you able to extrapolate
anything from these figures    Rhun. Let me just flick back to 1997, as
well as the results, I can bring up a chart which shows where turnout
was at its heaviest. This is Wrexham up here. This was one of
the lowest turnouts in Wales in the 1997 election. It is a very low
turnout this time but the drop is actually very consistent with what
we are having in other parts of Wales today. The comparison between
1997 and 2011 is natural but remember in 1997 there was a big
existential question, do you want evolution    devolution or not?
This time, it is a choice between two systems of primary law making
power. It is a narrow question which most people, frankly, we have
all struggled to find Lehmann's terms to describe this. We should
not be surprised that turnout is low. I'm not saying it is a good
thing but objectively, it is not a surprise that this is a low turnout
vote. Thank you both very much indeed.
We have heard the vote there in Wrexham, it is a pretty thumping
yes in Wrexham. If you are watching another part of the country and are
wondering, what about me, we will be coming to you. We have cameras
in every 22 of the camps and we will be coming to your parts of the
world I promise you. A yes in Wrexham, I think it is probably a
good time to get a steer on what the no campaign are saying at this
stage. They have had an opportunity to chew over a few of those results.
They can have a look at the results and the turnout. Why don't we go to
the Senedd now and talk to our reporter Bethan Lewis who, I hope,
is joined by Rachel Banner from the No campaign. I am indeed. Rachel
Banner is with me, your reaction to those results? It is disappointing
to us, that is true, but the turnout was very low. It suggests
that people were not out on the streets and Wrexham are demanding
more powers for politicians in Cardiff Bay. But a pretty
substantial change from how people voted in 1997, there seemed to be a
greater degree of devolution in the north east. I noticed the turnout
was down by 16 %. That is something which has to be addressed. We
cannot expect    we cannot... Although we accept that the Yes
vote appears to be winning at this point. I hope the politicians do
not see this as a ringing endorsement of the devolution
record to date because we want them to deal with the problems on
economy and we are the fastest declining of all the UK nations and
regions. They have made the point all along that those are matters to
do    be decided in the Assembly election. On this question, in
terms of changing the way the Assembly next Laws, he looks as if
people agree it is a good idea. That is the difference between a
devolution record and the performance of the Assembly
Government. We are talking about the devolution record and we won
back to work for Wales. People appear to have made that decision.
However, we have already heard today, this morning, that there
will not need to be any more referenda on a separate legal
system for Wales, the devolution of crime and policing, all those
things we brought up in the campaign, we are now hearing there
is unlikely to be another debate on those issues. You said you had been
very active in the north east, this result in Wrexham appears to show
you have not been that successful in getting your message across if
you were very active? We would love to have been more successful. We
have been very active over the last 2.5 years. We have had activity
going on in the north east, it has been intensified over the last
month with our North Wales representatives there. They have
done a very good job. It is very difficult to get people motivated
on a technical question like this. Back in 1997, there was a degree of
scepticism about devolution down the eastern border, particularly
maybe in the north east, it does seem as if that may have changed
slightly. One of the recurring messages we heard up in the north 
east, we have been to various places up there, in all of those
places, we heard the same story. They call it the South Wales
Assembly. That is something which needs to be addressed. Our
politicians here in Cardiff need to address the fact that there are
people in North Wales who do feel outside the situation. That is
reflected in those turnout figures. That is a low percentage for
Wrexham. It is important that this is not seen to be a wholesale
endorsement of the Assembly record. The devolution record, and that
something is done to ensure the people in North Wales feel included
in the political process. What about the results across the rest
of Wales, any idea where you may have done a bit better? It is
difficult to say. We are hoping for our heart lands in south east Wales,
Monmouthshire. We are hoping we get a good result in those areas. It is
difficult to tell and we are hoping that turnout will be higher in
those areas. Thank you, we may We are waiting to be able to go
over to Newport, where counting is frantically taking place there. We
are also going to go over to Neath Port Talbot and we will take you to
Merthyr Tydfil, so if you live in those areas, we will be coming to
you in a moment. We are hearing interesting things from all of
those counts. Why don't we update you on the story so far. These are
the main headlines from Referendum 2011: We can tell you that the
first results are in. You have seen them all live here. There are many
more to come. You will see them here during the course of the day.
First results are in. Wrexham, Blaenau Gwent, Denbighshire, all
say "yes". The counting is continuing across Wales and will do
so right throughout lunch time. The average turnout so far   and you
have to use this figure with a degree of caution   the average
turnout is round about 35% so far. Our political editor, Betsan Powys
is with me. We have heard from Ieuan Wyn Jones, we have heard from
the First Minister, we haven't heard from the Tories. What news do
you bring us from the Tory camp? have bumped into Nick Bourne and
Darren Millar. A matter of weeks ago we were hearing from
Conservative MPs who said, "We will stake our claim on this" and North
Wales is going to vote "no". It looks as though North Wales is
going to vote "yes" and someone like Darren Millar   our own BBC
opinion poll shows support amongst Labour members and Plaid members
yes, but not the vast majority of Conservative members. Jonathan
Evans was saying to me yesterday the question will be do they stay
at home, do they really have that appetite to take on Nick Bourne and
the leadership? There is a smile on Nick Bourne's face and look at the
figures. The answer seems clearly "no". When you are talking about
Pembrokeshire, where the "yes" vote is ahead, I don't think anybody had
expected that, certainly from either camp. We have talked about
the Labour Party, members of the Labour Party being split on further
devolution. We have talked about the Conservative Party being split
in some quarters on devolution. What does that mean as we now go
forward in a couple of months into an election campaign? Relationships
have been strained, there have been profound differences of opinion on
this. What does it mean as we go forward into a quick election,
soon? Yes, certainly there's been cross party consensus during the
campaign... From the leadership? Expect that to come to an end very
soon. We have been asking are we going to get this shot of all the
Party Leaders together celebrating a yes victory   it is not clear,
they all went to start thinking ahead to the Assembly election. It
is as if they have started to do that within the past few days.
Labour will be delighted with this. In Labour supporting areas, the
support for this yes vote are huge, greater than they would have dared
to hope. They will be looking at these figures and they will be
delighted. Not only has Carwyn Jones led from the front on this,
and others have allowed him to, even though there is an election
fairly soon, he has delivered. Labour will be delighted and those
big beasts knew that he would support a "no" vote and indeed he
did. He didn't come out early. He came out with a day to go saying,
"I don't think the Assembly is mature enough and I will be voting
no" but there was no great pull from that area as there were in the
past. Carwyn Jones is walking around, as is Leighton Andrews,
looking absolutely delighted. of hardened politicians, and
political commentators are walking around with a smile on their face
giving the impression that it is kind of all over. We know what the
story is going to be. What is the bellwether count in the next hour
or so where we know this is now the story, this is "yes"   oer a "no",
who knows? I have just read the word "rout" because I understand
nu' port looks like a "yes" vote. It is    I understand Newport looks
like a "yes" vote. I think it is pretty clear to us that this is
going to be a comprehensive victory to the "yes" side and the swing in
each seat seems pretty dramatic. I was interested to hear the
Professor whistle in amazement when we saw the last result in Wrexham.
Thank you very much. I can see that we are joined now by another
contributor in our big monitor, it is Paul Murphy, the former
Secretary of State for Wales. He joins us from Torfaen. Thank you
very much for your time. Thank you for talking to us. Why don't we get
our money's worth and ask you to do a reporter thing, what is the news
there? Well, I think we are definitely heading for a "yes" vote.
It looks about 60% in favour, 40% against which, for Torfaen, is a
substantial vote for the "yes" campaign. In 1997 this constituency
narrowly voted "no" and in 1978 overwhelming voted "no" so there's
been a big shift of opinion over the years, particularly here in
Torfaen. I think myself that is a consequence of this being a Labour
constituency, there is a Conservative Government in London,
people like me think that the Assembly has to have these powers
in order to protect Wales and in order to ensure that we concentrate
on the big issues of education, and health, and local government, and
roads, which will now face us. trying to read your mind because as
we go back over the years, you have been something of a sceptic when it
comes to devolution. I'm not sure whether you are whole heart think
there delighted to see what looks as if it is unfolding in front of
us today? To the contrary, I'm very much in favour of a "yes" vote. I
voted "yes" yesterday, obviously. I started off, you quite rightly
identify me as someone who was very sceptical about devolution, I then
became, when I was Secretary of State a devo realist. Now, the
Assembly has proven itself over the last decade or more, I'm for
delivering services for the Welsh people, I believe, and much more
importantly, my constituents now believe, that the Assembly is not
only here to stay, but is serving the people well and, for that
reason, my mind has changed over the years and it's a good enough
reason that the Assembly has proved itself and that we can protect our
people in Wales from the worst excesses of a right wing Government.
It is also about ensuring that they have the tools to do the job in
Cardiff and I am sure they will do the job well. There is nothing
wrong in changing your mind in politics, when events prove you to
have been wrong in the first place. Not all of Labour's veteran
politicians are of a like mind. You will know well the comments of one
who spoke to the BBC yesterday. He speaks for a lot of people in the
Labour Party, he said, when he says that he wasen convinced and wasn't
happy about this    wasn't convinced and wasn't happy about
this and was voting "no". It has also been a problem for the Labour
Party, hasn't it? There are people who have different views in the
Labour Party. We worked in this constituency for the last 45 years.
He has a slightly different view from me on this issue. He's
certainly with me, though, on the importance of ensuring that we
concentrate in the next months before the election for the
Assembly on the big issues that affect people's lives, like schools,
hospitals, rather than constitutional issues. This has
settled the constitutional issue, I believe, for a long time to come.
Now we have to concentrate on the real issues. I have no problem at
all. My view is clear, it is the view it would seem of the
constituents of mine in Torfaen, that they believe the Assembly
should have these extra powers. Paul Murphy, thank you very much
indeed for joining us there. I'm being told in my ear that we are
expecting a couple of results in the next couple of minutes. We are
not going to go to them just yet. We will talk to Betsan Powys. I'm
hearing one will be any second. Interesting hearing there, this has
been a wrestle for Labour big hitters, some Labour big hitters?
Yes. The difference between 1997 and from '79, clearly, which was
ancient history now, is enormous. You have to say that look at the
figures. It looks to me from doing the maths that the "yes" vote isn't
going to be down that much from 1997. The turnout is down, but the
"yes" vote won't be down that much. The "no" vote will be well done.
The "no" vote has not turned out and that means that those four
Party Leaders, but looking at the results so far, you have to say
Labour have got their vote out. So Kim Howells, he played his part.
Some people suggested you never want to be on the losing side and
perhaps they suspected they would be on the losing side this time
round. By the way, important information, John Prescott's
brother is at the count in Wrexham. I hope it's a peaceful occasion! We
know the Prescott family history when it comes to North Wales. We
won't revisit that! Betsan, thank you very much for the moment. It
goes without saying that we are on the edge of a number of counts
being announced in the next few minutes. In the last few moments, I
want to ask you about those people watching who didn't vote, who will
be looking on today in some amazement perhaps that there will
they will say, perhaps? Yes, but they are people who didn't turn out
to vote, so I think those who did will be within their rights to say,
"You didn't vote, so no complaints from you, please." I think we will
concentrate on the turnout, it isn't as low as people thought, it
is the extent of the "yes" victory at the moment which is the greatest
surprise. There will be some very basic and big changes to the ways
things work here. Thank you very much. The story continues even as I
Wales with people who are waiting to walk up on to stages and tell us
the story of what's going on. These are schools, and Sports Halls, and
council buildings, north, south, east and west, with the time
ticking away now, many of these people thinking that any second now
we are going to stand up and give the country the result from this
part of the world. So it is very clear that we have had only the
first few chapters of this story. We don't really have any real idea
of how it is going to end, not really   we think we do   but if
