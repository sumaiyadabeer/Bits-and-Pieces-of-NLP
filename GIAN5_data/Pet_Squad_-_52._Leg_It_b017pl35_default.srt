Three pampered pets One crazy goose
It all went bad when the goose got loose
Crazy times, and that's the truth
Boo boo be do do Doo be de doo
Prof's machine held a big surprise
For all the pets got trapped inside
All of them got superised
Boo boo be do do Boo be de doo
Oh, what's P Town going to do?
Some other pets got souped up, too
Watch out She's coming through...
I'll get you, Pet Squad!
P P Pet Squad.
Oops! Eek.
Huh?
Right, Pepe, this lab needs to be cleaned from top to bottom.
The sooner it's done, the sooner we can take the pets for walkies.
No probs, Profferino.
Be careful now, Pepe.
Oh!
These inventions can be...
..dangerous.
Oh! Avert your eyes, I'm not decent.
Oh!
Huh? Action stations, Bingo.
  But where's Sheeba?
  I don't know.
But when destiny calls, you can't let it go to voicemail!
Yee ha!
Whoa!
Wah ha hoo!
Oh!
'Superisation is go, go, go!'
Ha ha ha!
Ohh.
Sheeba, there you are. What's up?
Boys, it's time to clean house.
All right! Whoo hoo! Watsa!
Huh?
This lair is filthy!
You pressed the alarm for THAT?
The lair's lovely as it is.
Oh, really, Bingo?
You might have a point.
Go away, dust, you're not welcome here,
we don't like you here, so shoo!
I'm mopping, I'm mopping I'm mopping and body popping!
Dodge!
  Spoilsport.
Now, don't forget to clean under the Superiser.
  'Now don't forget to clean under the Superiser!'
Little help, big guy? Upsadaisy.
Hey,
never seen this button before. What's it do?
  I don't know.
  Ahh!
Don't press it!
Oh, but it's so big!
And red.
  Don't!
  This is actually quite heavy.
  Dodge!
  I'm not going to press...
Oh, my bad.
Huh? Aw, nothing happened!
It's alive!
'Emergency evasion. Protocol activated.'
Oh, boy!
  Hmm.
OK, let's not waste time figuring out who's to blame for this.
Like that would take long(!) Pepe!
  And now, Pepe, we need to...
  Pepe!
Where'd he go?
'Danger, danger, danger, danger,
'danger, danger...'
Hold it steady, Pepe!
Aha, steady as she goes, captain!
It's got a laser! Cool!
Would you look at that? Meow.
'Danger, danger, danger, danger...'
Mayor Matthews, tell us about this house of cards.
Well, Sarah, we're very proud, as it's the biggest in the world.
  It took the chief many...
  'Danger, danger,
'danger, danger, danger, danger...'
Phew!
As you can see, it's very well built.
  What was that?
  Oh!
  Whoopsie!
'Danger, danger, danger...'
'Superisation is go, go, go!'
Coo, coo!
Meow!
OK, we'll come back and fix that later. We got bigger problems.
Ahh...
I need this break, Norman.
It's so stressful being P Town's premier evil genius.
'Ere, Ma'am, Pet Squad!
Yes, Norman, they DO foil every one of my schemes,
those interfering do gooders!
Mother Goose, the Superiser, the Superiser!
You're right, they'd be nothing without that infernal machine.
If only I could get my hands on it!
If only it would just turn up on my doorstep.
'Danger, danger, danger...'
Hey!
Hey, Goosie!
Don't get up!
To the duck copter!
'Danger, danger...'
I think it's getting tired.
Maybe it's hungry. I know I am.
Everybody, get ready to jump.
Ohh.
One, two...
three!
Huh?
'Dan ger, dan gerrrr...'
Yes, a magnet!
Didn't think of that, did you?
Now I've got the Superiser, P Town will be mine.
No way, feather brain. We'll catch you.
On what, pussycat...
Wheee!
..your annoying flying robot?
Hey, I have a magnetic personality, I know it.
So long, losers!
Like taking candy from a baby!
Can it, you foul goose!
Can it! Can...it? You get...?
Oh, boy.
Hungry!
  This is no time for sandwiches.
  Oh!
For once, it is!
Hey! I can see the Professor's house from here.
Now, when I build Goose Land,
should I put the chocolate fountain there or there?
Ma, pigeon!
Oh, Norman, I know I said you needed a hobby,
but it's no time for birdwatching.
Pigeon! Pigeon!
MOTHER GOOSE HONKS Evasive manoeuvres!
That's it, Pidgie, grab the big shiny thing
and you can have this nice tasty sandwich.
Ahh!
Yeah!
'Danger.' SUPERISER BLEEPS
And heave, Pidgie.
'Dangggeeerrrrrr.'
It's no good,
he isn't strong enough to break the force of the magnet.
Bingo?
Oh, crikey!
I hate jumping off Superised birds on an empty tummy.
'Danger.'
Ohh!
I got you, big guy.
Me sandwich!
Oh!
That   is   it!
I am guinea pig,
hear me roa a a ar!
Huh? Whoa!
Erm...
Hooray!
Go, Pet Squad! Go, Pet Squad! Go, Pet Squad! Go! Go!
No!
Quickly, Norman, turn it around. Dive! Dive!
Uh oh.
Hey, that looks familiar.
Huh? What? Who?
Hey, Professor, don't mind me. Just getting ahead of myself.
A head! Ha ha! A head!
Well, we've had smoother landings.
'Danger...'
Oh, no, not again!
'Emergency evasion protocol deactivated.
'Have a nice day.'
That's enough out of you! And somebody owes me a sandwich.
'So, Chief Delaney, there,
'putting the final touches to his house of cards.'
What a day.
At least everything is back to normal.
No, I've a terrible feeling we forgot something.
Thank you, thank you.
Coo, coo.
Uh oh!
Come on, we've got a giant pigeon to de superise.
Or...food first?
Bingo!
Maybe just a TINY snack?
