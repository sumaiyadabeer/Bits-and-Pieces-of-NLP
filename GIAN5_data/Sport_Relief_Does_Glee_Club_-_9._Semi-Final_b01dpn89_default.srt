Tonight Tonight
Well done, guys.
What a way to kick off the show. Did you enjoy that? Yes.
You seemed as though you did. Let's see what the judges thought. Carrie,
what did you think of Move On Up? With the Glee Club you are looking
for uniformity and that you gave us in shed loads. Really great
blending and lovely arrangements of the vocals, no one poking out more
than the next person. Really lovely to watch. Your soloist a little
weak. But overall a fantastic performance.
Sisco, did the choreography compliment the vocals? Some Glee
clubs go too crazy and make the vocals suffer. You guys stuck to
what you know. You stuck to the song. I love the soloist, the boy,
it was a nice, nice, nice little package. Well done, guys.
Thank you very much, judges. Remember it is your vote that
counts. If Move On Up are your favourite
performers and you want to see them in the Grand Final, you need to
vote for them, but only when the phonelines open and all five acts
have performed. Do not call now as your vote won't
be counted and you may still be charged.
Give it up for Move On Up. Good start. Now we've started. OK,
the next act to perform are our Ain't no mountain high value
Ain't no valley low enough We are Blaze and we're from Grimsby.
It sounded beautiful. That was so easy to watch. I felt
really at ease watching you. Fantastic and lovely blending.
Blaze finished in second position on the leaderboard. We are going to
try and play to our strengths like use what we've got and use it to
the best of our abilities. We're going to be going for it!
These girls really just want to
have a whole load of fun. It is have a whole load of fun. It is
Blaze. I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
"Oh mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones."
And girls they want to have fun Oh girls just want to have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
"Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one."
But girls they want to have fun Oh girls just want to have
That's all they really want Some fun
When the working day is done Girls, they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I want to be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they want to have fun Oh girls just want to have
That's all they really want Some fun
They want to have fun They want to have fun
Girls, they want to have fun Girls they want
Want to have fun Girls, want to have fun
Girls, want to have fun
Yes! Put your hands up. Put your hands
up. Girls Just Want To Have Fun. You really enjoyed that, girls. Did
you enjoy it. Yes. Lovely Myleene, were you
entertained? Hugely entertained. I really loved everything you came
out with. You said that you were going to give it all that you got.
I loved the piece that you chose. I loved the blend of the vocals. You
worked really hard on getting those really precise. The dancing was
energetic, but you allowed the vocals to shoot out at us. It was
brilliant. Well done, girls.
David, you coached the likes of Take That which makes us like you
move and Will Young. How were the vocals? They have to find the right
balance between energy and accuracy. Energy in the performance, but the
vocals have got to be on point otherwise the whole thing falls
apart. Your focals were crisp and the harmonies were good. The
balance of the harmonies within the group were good. You You wobbled a
bit at the end, but by then I was sold. The whole performance vocally
was very, very strong and the best I heard you sing.
Wow. Thank you very much. But it is not up to them to decide who goes
through, it is up to you. If Blaze were your favourite and
you want to see them in the Grand Final, you need to vote for them,
but only when the phonelines open. Do not call now as your vote won't
be counted and you may still be charged. Give it up right now for
Blaze.
I'm having fun. Now the next act to perform is our Glee Club from
Paisley, it is Vocalise. We're Vocalise and we're from
Grimsby. The time is right
The sun is sinking in the sky I will read your mind
You never know what you might find
You know we won't compromise Let you show that
What you were doing was saying, "We are super good. Listen to us
singing together the same notes.". Vocalise finished in fourth on the
leaderboard. Go baby, go We will be bigger, better, brighter,
more harmonies. Singing and dancing for you and for
Bottom. It's the way I'm feeling We Found Love in a hopeless place
We Found Love in a hopeless place We found in a hopeless place
We Found Love in a hopeless place We Found Love in a hopeless place
Well done. That was a very energetic performance. I'm
shattered just watching. Sisco, what did you think? I thought it
was a great song choice. My only critique was with the soloist, your
voice is so angelic, I would have preferred a raw voice, maybe a male
vocal. As soon as the harmony came on, you guys sounded excellent.
Overall, it was a very energetic and fun performance, well done guys.
Carrie, earlier you said Vocalise looked and sounded like a Glee
Club? I stand by that. I wanted to pick up on what Sisco said. Today
is nerve wracking. This is live television and it is scary, scary,
scary. I want to give you a couple of points just for the nerve factor.
I think Sisco is right, but it is nervy. Harmonies wise, it sound
good. Harmonies wise, good. Remember the the power is in your
hands. It is up to you to decide who goes through to the final. If
you want to see Vocalise in the Grand Final then you need to vote
for them, but only when the phonelines open and all five acts
have performed. Don't call now because your vote won't count and
you maybe charged. Give it up for Vocalise.
OK, the next group to grace the
stage is a group from East London. It is The Real Deal. I can reveal
that the winner of today's heat is We are the We are We are The Real
Deal. We asked you to sing better in your Unison singing and you
really have pulled that off. I really want to be a part of your
group because I understood the intensity.
The Real Deal finished in third position on the leaderboard to
qualify for today's semi final. We're going to make sure we put in
more and take the judges' comments Singing and and dancing for you and
Time goes by and the sun comes I'm Glad You Came
You and me Take you by the hand
And drink if you can can Can you spend a little time
Time is slipping away Away from us so stay
Stay with me I can make you Make you Glad You Came
The sun goes down The stars come out
And all that counts Is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm Glad You Came The sun goes down and the stars
come out And all that counts is here and
My universe will never be the same
I'm Glad You Came Well done.
Wow.
Well done The Real Deal. The audience were stamping their feet
and everything. Me and Mark are good friends with
The Wanted. We are not. We don't have any
access to them. Did the The Real Deal's personality
come out in that performance? bucket loads. They are what I call
sloppy tight! The moves they do, they look all over the place and
they suddenly come together in a really structured way. I loved the
vocals, they have got good soloist and they have got loads and loads
of energy. Imper Imperfections add to the whole feel and I loved it.
Nice one.
We thrive off imperfections me and Mark!
Myleene, were you impressed? thought you had buckets of attitude
and in the right way. The way you delivered that song is
brilliant. The only thing I would want to do is put the song up a
couple of keys. It felt low. You guys have the vocals. You played
around with the song and a lot of professionals couldn't do that so
well done. Well, thank you, judges, but it is
up to you at home. Who do you want to go through to the final? If The
Real Deal were your favourite performance and you want to see
them in the Grand Final, you will need to vote for them when the
phonelines open and all five acts are performed. Don't vote now as
the lines aren't open and you may still be charged. Give it up for
the The Real Deal. It is our Glee Club from South
London. Apples and pears. The winners of today's heat is
I'm a survivor We're Origin8 and we're from South 
East London. I'm a survivor
There is not one weak weak weak link in there.
The whole performance jumped out and was possibly the best
performance I have seen on this stage today.
Origin8 finished top of the leaderboard to qualify for today's
semi final. We will persevere and try harder.
Will this song help them kick it to the final. Singing and dancing for
the final. Singing and dancing for you and Sport Relief, it is Origin8.
I would like to see LA I really want to come kicking
with you You will be my American Boy
Can we get away this weekend? Let's go shopping, baby then we
go to a cafe Let's go down the subway
I have never been to Brooklyn and I like to see what is good
Your fancy clothes Talk that sleek talk like this
American Boy I'd like to see LA
I really want to come kicking with you
You will be my American Boy Well done.
Come on boys, you can get get up now. That looks painful! Carrie,
was that the standard you were expecting there? Well, these guys
have the most to lose. When you are top of the leaderboard, the
pressure is on. You really delivered today. Your soloists are
amazing.
I have one note for you, you look like you are really happy. Please
look like you are enjoying it when you are performing.
Sisco, what did you think of Origin8 there? This is the first
time I get to see you guys and I'm blown away. Your voices are
incredible. Your soloists have amazing recording voices. I can
hear it on a record. You have this R&B sound like back in 702 days.
You guys have given me everything. I love the choreography, you didn't
do too much, you kept it simple and it was great.
The decision of who goes through to the Grand Final is up to you, if
Origin8 were your favourite and you want to see them in the in the
Grand Final, you need to vote for them, but only when the phonelines
open. Give it up for Origin8. Well done, guys.
This is the exciting bit because all five acts have performed and we
need a voice of authority to deliver a message of high
importance. But who can we ask? I think I can help with that boys.
Cheers Mr D. Who do you think we can ask.

12 minutes. Calls are free from a BT and most landlines. Some

Some fun When the working day is done
We got love in a hopeless place You and me
Turn the lights out now I will take you by the hand
Oh drink if you can can Can you spend a little time
Come kicking with me You will be my American Boy
American Boy So those were tonight's acts and
Good luck to everyone!
It is a strong semi final. A strong semi final.
Let's have a chat with our judges. David, were there any surprises for
you today? The thing that surprised me the most was some of the song
choices. At this stage song choices are really important and I think
that they chose songs that really showed the kind of Glee clubs that
they were, but some of them didn't play fully to all the strengths
they've got. Now I think everything that was done, was done well, but
there were some you just thought, "Wow if you had chosen that song
for the style that you were, you could have been stronger." To be
specific, I thought Move On Up were really good. Dance school, musical
theatre. Blaze had really good soloists, Vocalise they had a great
song choice and performed it very well. The Real Deal cute. Lots of
energy. Sloppy tight, nice. Loads of charm. Origin8 probably the most
polished. It is going to be really interesting to see which of those
the viewers go, "Yeah, I love." Because they are very, very, very
different. Cheers, David.
Myleene, how difficult is it for these guys to sing and dance at the
same time? It doesn't always come naturally to people when it comes
to singing and dancing. There is usually a person that can sing
better than dance and the key is to keep on practising even when you
think you have got it. You see people's nerves kick in if they are
in an unusual environment. Doing anything on a stage like this, in
front of a crowd, the lights going on, the crowds here and I suppose
the cameras, knowing you are live, it changes the dynamics when you
are singing with your hairbrush or in a rehearsal space. Anyone that
says, "I can sing and dance." To do both is a real gift. If you are not
naturally inclined to do both, you have to work and work and work
until you just hear that track and you find yourself doing it.
Practise is the key. Sisco, what did you think of the
choreography? I am relieved that every single Glee Club stuck to the
song. Sometimes the choreography is doing the opposite. It needs to
marren ate. Every single Glee Club did that very well today.
Carrie? Following Up from what Myleene said, the nerves here today
and when you are competing, they feel scared. Whefz what they are   
we have seen what they are like in in rehearsals. Some stood and did
really well and some fell a little. But they are so diverse, that's
what I love about the five five finalists, they are so different.
There is something for everyone. We are not judging the songs, we are
judging the Glee clUbs.    clubs.
The decision is out of your hands. Back off. Back off.
Right, it is down to you who goes through to the Grand Final and the
chance to be crowned winners of Sport Relief Does Glee Club 2012.
You only have approximately six minutes left to vote for your your
favourite. All right, here is a reminder of
Good luck, indeed. Calls are free a BT and most landlines. Some mobile
operators will charge for the calls. Please ask for the bill payers
permission. You can enter the Sport Relief Mile
and raise money for people who really need it here in the UK and
in the world's poorest countries. Recently we met a young girl from
Hull and found out how the money you raise really does make a
difference. Sport Relief money is funding over
1,300 projects in the UK. We went to Hull to see how our money is
We are here in Hull to meet a special girl called Shauna.
And to see how Sport Relief funding helped her.
Shauna is enjoying secondary school. Loves One Direction and is a fan of
Hull FC team. Shauna is a carer to her mum. Shauna, tell us about your
lovely mum? My mum has multiple sher multiple sclerosis. I help my
mum with the cooking and the washing up and I help with the
injections and getting things ready for her. She does put herself down
a bit because she does a lot more than she makes out. She also sleeps
downstairs. I sleep on the recliner and Shauna will sleep on the see
the sofa. She is always the first one to say, "I'm staying downstairs
with mum.". It is obvious that Shauna is a great support to her
mum and there is a place that's a Hessle Road Network is a community
run organisation that delivers a wide range of services to local
people, especially young people like Shauna. They have a fantastic
youth project running activities including arts and crafts and
mentoring and support is provided through project workers who is
Sport Relief funded. Shauna has really developed in
confidence since I have been working with her. She is just
lovely to work with and I mean she receives one to one mentoring from
me. It is just any issues that are concerning her at home or at school
or anywhere. She is a breath of fresh air. When
we met her. She is lovely. I need to stop doing that. Now it
is obvious how important the the Hessle Road network is.
If you donate, you will help projects like this. Shauna is a
massive rugby fan and we have set up a surprise for her. We are about
to play an important game of dodgeball. Shauna, you have got
nobody on your team. We have got a surprise for you. Please welcome,
sam, Mark, Wade, Peter and the players and coach from Hull rugby
Come on over lads. Come on over, girls.
Come on, Shauna, over here. I think it is fair to say that your team
won! Yeah.
Well
Well done,
Well done, Shauna.
Well done, Shauna. Yes,
Well done, Shauna. Yes, having fun and being happy, that's what being
a child is all about. Coming here has made a real difference to
Shauna's life. Have you had a good day? Yes.
Thank you for letting us be a part of it. Shauna, everybody.
To find out more about the Sport Relief Mile, visit the Sport Relief
website and click on the Sport Relief link. You have 48 hours to
register. Lovely. Lovely, Shauna there. You
can get involved and sign up for the Sport Relief Mile. You don't
have to run it, you can walk it and it will be a great day. Sport
Relief money does help people lead a better life and give young people
hope for a better future and we were rubbish at dodgeball! That's
true, Shauna and the Hull FC rugby boys were better.
Me again. All right.
Stop voting, everybody. The phonelines are now closed.
Cheers Mr D. We will count and verify your votes. If you call now,
your vote won't be counted. Sam, where are you, I miss you? I am
backstage. I will be back with you soon. I am here with our Glee Clubs.
We have got The Real Deal here. How are you feeling? We are nervous and
excited. It is down to the public vote so we just want to have fun
with it and that's what we did. High five to that. I like it.
Over here we have got Vocalise. How Are the nerves? We are nervous to
see how we have done and how many people voted for us, but it is a
big weight off. Over here, we have got Origin8. How
are you feeling? It is surreal, but I speak on behalf of the group
members to say we have had fun and we're happy that we're here, you
know. So you really enjoyed your performance? Yes.
We have got Blaze. How are you doing girls? What would it mean for
you guys to get through to the final? It is great to get to the
semi finals, but to get to the final, and it is great to have the
opportunity to be here. It has been great fun.
And were you happy with your performance? The judges comments
gave us a boost. So you are happy? Yes.
Over here we have Move On Up. How are you doing guys? Yes.
How do you think your performance went? All feeling nervous, but we
feel we did the best we could do and hopefully the public will vote
for us. You opened the show. How was that
for the nerves? That's hard because there was nobody to follow, but we
gave it our best shot and hoped that we did well.
How much would it mean to get through to the final? It would mean
a lot. We worked really hard and we hope we did it.
Give us a final cheer. The best of luck to all
of you. Mark, back to you, buddy. Cheers, mate. While we wait for the
final results. Helping us support Sport Relief Week, we have only

Now please welcome back on to the
stage, our Glee Clubs. Move On Up, Blaze, Vocalise, The Real Deal and
Welcome back, guys. Welcome back. OK, we are moments away from
revealing the three acts going through to the Grand Final. You
have all done amazingly well to get to the semi finals. You should give
yourselves a massive applause. In fact do that right now.
Amazing standard. Really, really
great semi final. But we have the results. They have been checked and
verified and we do have our three finalists. Good luck to everyone.
You have been brilliant. In no particular order, I can
reveal that the first Glee Club going through to the Grand Final
is... Origin8.
Congratulations, Origin8. They are
through to the final. The second Glee Club going through
to the Grand Final is... Move On Up.
Well done, we will see new the
final. Finally, the third Glee Club through to the Grand Final is...
