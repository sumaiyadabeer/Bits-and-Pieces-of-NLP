I've been fighting your consumer nightmares for years now.
In that time I've won over £100,000 in compensation for you.
This time, though, I don't want companies to buy their way out of trouble.
What I want are big changes.
I want to make sure that your consumer nightmares are put to bed once and for all.
Coming up on today's programme: I look into extended car warranties.
seven months because no one would take responsibility for fixing it.
It felt like they wanted me to go away, get on with it, sort it out yourself.
And I'll arm you in the fight against cowboy builders.
My industry insider spills the beans on bad building practice.
It's something you can't afford to miss.
They are just there to make a quick buck.
Don't really care about the next customer.
Plus, I'm out on the high street putting you to the test.
How much do you really know about your consumer rights?
  Do I need to have a TV license?
  And they have to let you use it.
And I think they should refund me back my money.
Ask them for compensation.
There are over 30 million cars on the UK's roads.
Over three quarters of all the country's households own one.
Keeping these cars up and running is big business for companies selling extended warranties.
For many people they provide peace of mind   or so you'd hope.
Inconvenient to say the least.
What about if those seven days turn into...
seven months? You would understandably blow a gasket.
Especially if your warranty company was about as useful as a square peg in a round hole.
Meet Paula from Plymouth. She's the mother of two teenage children.
Like many of us, she's reliant on the family car.
A car is really essential for us as a family.
My daughter is disabled.
She has something caused Albright syndrome, so we have regular hospital appointments.
My son's very active with rugby, football, so he needs a taxi, as all teenage boys do.
Teenagers, eh?
It's not just for the kids that Paula needs her car.
As a community nurse, she travels all over the south west of England visiting her patients.
Keeping her car up and running is essential.
Back in June 2008 the warranty on Paula's Ford Focus ran out.
On the very day that happened, she was cold called by an extended warranty company
called The Motoring Organisation,
or TMO for short.
They said, "Would you be interested?"
The story started there, really.
TMO offered Paula an extended warranty package that would cost £22.98 a month.
Just shy of £300 a year.
It would cover all mechanical breakdowns for all major parts of the car.
Of course, there were terms and conditions,
but Paula thought she was pretty much covered.
Wasn't really that interested in taking it on on the phone.
I asked them to send me all the details because it sounded like a good idea.
It would give me extra peace of mind for the car.
When I received all the paperwork it seemed legitimate.
They seemed like a big company,
so I decided to go with them.
Her decision seemed a wise one.
When the turbo on her car broke down in March 2009, she took it to a garage selected by TMO.
It took a week to fix.
And not everything was covered by the warranty.
Paula had to pay £234.91 of the £800 bill.
When the same fault happened just three days later, things started to stall   big time.
We had five weeks of arguing over who was going to pay for the turbo to be replaced again.
I got the car back. Ten days later the same fault again.
Two months with one garage.
Paula's car was still not properly fixed.
Finally, after weeks of pleading, TMO agreed with Paula
that the car should go to another of their approved garages.
But TMO's next set of mechanics thought it wasn't a new turbo that was needed. It was a new engine.
Two months of wrangling over who would pay for the new engine followed. Guess what?
When it was eventually fitted it didn't even work.
On to the next garage.
I got my car back
mid October, so the car was basically off the road from mid March to mid October.
So in total seven months.
You what? The car went to three garages,
all recommended by the warranty company TMO,
who between them fitted two turbos and two engines,
resulting in a seven month wait until Paula got her working car back.
It sounds like a bad joke.
Having her community nursing to attend to meant Paula could not be without a car for that long.
In the time that I didn't have my car,
I spent £3,500 on hire car charges for the seven months.
The warranty covered the cost of the repairs but left Paula with a bill
of £3,500 for the car rental
due to the incompetence of TMO's chosen garages.
All this time she continued to pay her £23 monthly bills to TMO.
I think TMO have been really unfair
to expect anybody to be without their car for seven months.
If Dom could sort this out for me and I get my car hire charges back, I'd love him forever.
Don't worry, Paula, I do this for the love of consumer justice.
That's why I'm burning rubber down to Plymouth.
Paula's written to me because she forked out for the top of the range warranty.
She did that because she wanted peace of mind.
She's had anything but that.
Peace of mind? Yeah, right(!) TMO will get a piece of my mind.
Hi, Dom.
Lovely to meet you. Horrible weather.
Awful. Come on in.
Thank you very much.
The thing is about extended warranties,
I am sure this is the reason you took it out, they are meant to give you peace of mind.
  Did you get that?
  No.
  Not at all.
  Describe what you got.
I got a very...shoddy service.
  As far as they were concerned, were you getting fobbed off?
  Yes.
Definitely. That is what I felt like all the time.
It felt like they just wanted me to go away.
Get on with it, sort it out yourself.
Which is not why I took the warranty at all.
Who did you think TMO were?
I wasn't really sure at the time.
What I did notice is when the car went into the garages
all three garages called it an AA warranty.
So I'm not sure if they were anything to do with....
When you handed over your booklet?
No. When they actually contacted the warranty company they...
and I spoke to the garage, they would say,
"Oh the AA warranty company have just phoned and said this or that."
  That's interesting.
  I had no idea it was anything to do with the AA.
  As we are standing here now you still don't know whether it is AA or whatever it is?
  No.
Well, that's confusing, to say the least.
But the issue of whether car hire is
included in the warranty cover
is not cut and dry either.
On closer examination
of Paula's paperwork, it seems TMO
will only pay car hire charges
if the individual repair takes longer than eight hours.
I said what about waiting for a part? This is the reason it took a week  
they had to wait for the new turbo to be delivered.
They said, that doesn't count it's the work on the car.
  Don't like the sound of that.
  I know, I know.
But you know, you learn by your mistakes, as they say.
  It's not your mistake.
  No.
  This is the terms and conditions.
There's not many jobs that could possibly take more than 12 hours, even if you put a new engine in.
'This meant there was no hire car included in Paula's package.'
She would have been happy to pay for it for a week or so.
But seven months? Surely TMO should be covering these costs?
It was their garages that were responsible for the long delays getting her car back.
  Be realistic here, what are you expecting out of this?
  Honestly, just to get the hire car back.
The money back would be a huge weight off my shoulders.
The £3,500 I've paid out.
How did you manage to pay that?
Credit cards.
You know.
You're not a lady of means?
No. No. You know, I have quite a hefty mortgage.
Two teenage children and, you know....
  £3,500 hurts?
  It does.
  It would most people, but your circumstances are slightly more, I think.
  Yeah.
I will try my hardest for you to see what I can get back.
They have got an argument with me in the fact they can say, "Our T&C says no hire car."
Right. So don't hold your breath.
  No.
  What I can say is I'm very tenacious and I don't give up when someone says no.
The fact someone says no to me,
I think, "Great, I was hoping you would say this."
These people might be good once I take them on.
At the end of the day, it should not take seven months for a car.
You are right. You could almost have a baby in seven months, couldn't you?
  What I want from you is all the details.
  Yep.
  Lovely, let's have those, then.
Well, I've got her paperwork.
But I've also brought something along for Paula.
To help take on her case, she's becoming my investigator.
Firstly, I want her to talk to other garages
and find out what would normally happen with a breakdown like hers.
Secondly, to shop around a bit to find out what other warranty companies are offering.
I have to be honest, I feel a bit sorry for Paula.
She is one person who particularly needs a good warranty cover on her car.
She's a single mum and she also needs it for work.
The first thing I will do is chase TMO. I want the car sorted out.
I want to make sure she doesn't have any more inconvenience.
I want to get back all her hire car charges as well.
Let's see how I get on.
Coming up: I fire up my consumer panel and TMO prove harder to find than a left handed screwdriver.
I found absolutely nothing.
We've asked you to tell us what rights you think you have as a consumer.
So, it's time to get street legal and find out whether you know when you're being sold a lemon.
Sometimes big companies think they can get away with treating us like dummies.
There's no point getting hot under the collar unless you get your facts straight.
My research team have been on the high streets to find out how much you know about your consumer rights.
The results are pretty juicy.
Let's find out what these guys think is actually true.
To stop cold calling and getting junk mail, I do believe you have to go ex directory.
There are ways to put a stop to those really annoying companies,
that is by registering with the Telephone Preference Service and the Mailing Preference Service.
Once you've done that and left your name and number, they should leave you alone.
However, if they don't, put it in writing.
After you've done that they are legally obliged to get off your case.
OK. Didn't know that.
If you book a package holiday and when you arrive the hire car isn't there,
I think you could probably only get back the cost of the hire car.
Well, the good news is you are protected by the package tour regulations,
which state you are entitled to at least the cost of the service that you didn't get back.
You may also be able to get compensation.
That would be for any out of pocket expenses,
or if they don't offer you alternative transport at no additional cost.
Woo hoo.
If I bought a bed and they gave me a cooling off period, and I decided
to change my mind, then I think, yes, I would get my deposit back.
You probably are entitled to your deposit back.
Remember this, consumer law works two ways.
It also protects the retailer as well as you.
If they have got out of pocket expenses, let's say because the bed was being made especially for you,
they would be entitled to claim that out of your deposit.
  Not bad.
But not the best display of consumer know how.
Trust me, know your rights and you won't get done.
Still to come, my industry insider lifts the lids on the bodger and scarper world of bad builders.
I'm investigating extended warranty provider TMO for Paula,
a single mum who was left without her car for seven months.
I think it's high time they found out I'm on the case.
I'm going to ring this company up, see what they have to say about everything.
I don't sense...
that it's going to go that well.
I dial the same and only number Paula has ever been able to get for TMO. Straightaway I'm confused.
'Thank you for calling the claims department.
'Motorway Direct plc are the administrators of your policy.
'Motorway Direct PLC are authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority...'
Who are Motorway Direct?
Let's worry about that later. First thing's first.
'I cannot talk about the policy without the policy holder's authorisation,
'due to data protection.'
I understand that. We have consent forms
and I will get them e mailed over to you.
'I'd need to speak to the policy holder first.'
Before we go any further they want to speak to Paula direct. Fair enough.
I'm about to witness first hand how customer confusion comes about.
Can you give me the e mail address I can send that to?
'If you send it to...
'at AA warranty.'
'Hang on, where did the AA appear from?
'I've gone from TMO to Motorway Direct and now the AA.'
When you say AA Warranty, are you associated with the AA?
'We are on behalf of the AA.'
The Automobile Association.
  You sell on behalf of them?
  'Yes.'
Is that every warranty that gets sold from you would be on behalf of the AA?
  'No, sir.'
  It's just a policy which is one that you can have associated with AA?
  'Yes, sir.'
  I'm going to get her to give you a call now.
She'll give you some authorisation for me.
'Thank you, bye.'
Three different company names in three minutes, that's got to be a record.
I'm still none the wiser.
No wonder Paula got a bit confused. Anyway,
more of that later.
Whoever they are, Paula has now given them permission to talk to me.
Ben, Paula has given you
a call now and given you
her consent to continue the
phone call with me on her behalf.
'I've had that conversation, yes.'
'As this is really my first proper contact with this company,
'I hit Ben with a few questions I'd like answered.'
Do you know the warranty this Paula had? What was it called?
'Not in front of me at the moment, no.'
Is it on the system?
'Yes.
'The...excuse me, Motoring Organisation MI, mechanical insurance and it's Prestige Plus.'
Prestige Plus. What does the policy cover and exclude?
'Many parts it covers and excludes.'
You couldn't give me a general list?
'Obviously there's a massive amount of things it does exclude and doesn't exclude.'
Do you know if the warranty includes a hire car?
'On that policy, without the book in front of me, that's why I obviously need to
'get the questions you need to me to answer and then talk to a supervisor
'and get the answers and call you back.'
'It doesn't seem like I'm going to get any answers today.
'So I'm going to have a take a closer look myself.' Thank you, Ben. Goodbye.
I think I've just rung the bell with that one.
The warranty she got sold is one of their own warranties.
I've asked for a copy of that and I'm going to go through it with a fine tooth comb.
I have a feeling it will open up a can of worms.
The ball is well and truly rolling now.
I need a plan. First is to tackle TMO and establish who is responsible for
the seven months Paula had to wait to get her car working
and, therefore, the £3,500 she is out of pocket for hire car charges.
But there is something else bothering me about this case.
Do you know what, Doms? One of the biggest problems I have is I don't know who TMO are.
You mean AA Warranties, don't you?
Hang on a second. I have come across another company called Motorway Direct. Who are they?
I'll tell you what, Dom, you've got your work cut out.
No, it means you have.
Look, guys, we need to get to the bottom of this. Who are TMO?
Good point.
Who are TMO?
Now that's a question customers shouldn't really have to ask.
I always advise anyone signing a contract
to do a little research of their own before putting that pen to paper.
So, I've recruited a cross section of the great British public
to see what they can discover about the Motoring Organisation using the internet.
I'm in my 60s, I am retired and I don't have much experience with the internet.
My name's Elizabeth, I'm 23, I'm a recent graduate.
I consider myself quite good on the internet, I use it most days.
I'm an IT manager from Clapham in London.
If there's any information about the Motoring Organisation out there, I'm pretty confident I can find it.
Very cocksure.
Well, on your marks, get set, go.
I tried everything I could to find the Motoring Organisation.
A looked for a website in various search engines.
I found absolutely nothing.
I tried everything I could.
I still couldn't find them.
This is painful, but has our IT expert pulled something out of the bag?
I was able to find out they are a trading company.
They are on Companies House website.
There's nothing wrong with not having a website, of course, but what this experiment shows is that
if, after receiving that cold call, Paula had tried to find out more about TMO, she would have struggled.
That's not great for the consumer.
Back in Plymouth, Paula has been busy too.
When I first met her I gave her a list of things to do.
First up, I want her to check out other warranty companies.
Could she have got a better deal elsewhere?
Right, so I've got a few numbers now for warranty companies.
I'm just going to ring around now and find out exactly what they have to offer.
How much their policies cost, what's covered and maybe if they
include a courtesy car, which I should maybe have thought of before.
Paula rings a couple of different companies and after the initial formalities...
I'm looking at getting an extended warranty for my car.
It's a Ford Focus C Max.
  I'll try another one.
  Paula then gets the news she was dreading.
Car hire's covered then, is it?
After ringing around, getting different quotes, Paula's not a happy bunny.
No, I basically did not get a very good deal with TMO.
By the sounds of it, all these were actually cheaper
than TMO's cover and offering more.
I feel absolutely gutted.
Because maybe with a bit of homework, like Dom said, before I had actually taken out this warranty
I probably would have got a better deal.
But there you go.
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.
Although not all of the deals included car rental,
many of those that did were a lot cheaper than a TMO policy.
So, now on to the next issue, how long should it have taken to mend her car?
I'm off to a local garage to find out how much it would have cost me to
have the repairs done there if I hadn't used the warranty company.
And how long it would have taken.
A bit of research that Dom gave me as homework.
It will be quite interesting to see
what sort of scenario they come up with.
The original breakdown of her car was caused by the turbo
but that started a seven month saga to get it fixed.
Hello, Nigel.
Spoke to you on the phone. I just wanted to know if you could let me know how much
you would have charged me and how long the work would have taken
for a new turbo for my Ford Focus C Max.
The mechanic does what they do best and takes a good look under the bonnet.
Time to hear his verdict.
So, Nigel, how much you think it should have cost me and how long would it have taken?
It's not a brand new vehicle so we would say about two hours to do the job.
The price of the labour, the parts,
the turbocharger itself, and the VAT, you're looking about £750.
Initially when I took the car in, it took them a week.
  To do the job?
  To do the job.
We would say probably... We take the turbocharger off.
We get the numbers off it so we would make sure it's the right turbocharger.
Turnaround time on the turbocharger about two days, maybe three days.
And then you've got your fitting time so three, maybe four days at the outside to have it back.
Right, so they took a bit longer than they should have, anyway.
Well, it's better to get the job done properly.
But they didn't do the job properly.
That was the big problem. They didn't do it properly.
Well thanks Nigel, that's great. Lovely.
£750, that sounds about right.
And it sounds like it should have only taken a few days
to get the car back on the road, certainly not seven months.
An extended warranty
for me now would not be an option, I think.
I'll just find a decent garage,
someone you can trust   but that's easier said than done.
It's only because I've had to go out and do some research that it turns out this one is literally
right on my doorstep and I never knew it was here.
Obviously there are no guarantees in the world of car repairs but the one thing I do know
is seven months is a pretty long time to wait
and it seems that TMO's garages are responsible for causing this delay.
Everything Paula's dug up will be added to our arsenal against TMO.
So I put together a strongly worded e mail for them to digest.
Right then, while TMO work out what their next move is going to be, I want to look into a different issue.
One I think every consumer needs to understand.
I know for sure that Paula's warranty company is not the AA,
but they do sell a product called an AA warranty that apparently has nothing to do with the AA.
Or does it? Time to try and clear this up.
We've contacted the AA to get their take on this consumer confusion
and their relationship with Motorway Direct and TMO.
It looks like an AA warranty could be pretty similar to a TMO warranty,
it's just being sold under a different name.
And, most importantly, for a different price.
This all seems to marry up to the e mail I've got from the AA.
They mention a business practice called white labelling. White what?
For a bit of clarification I've come to meet the consumer experts at Which.
Can you tell me about white labelled goods?
White labelling is two things.
High street retailers basically
cannot make some of their own products.
So they go and source them elsewhere. Usually from East Asia.
They source these things and stick their own brands on them.
Presumably it's legal?
Absolutely. It is legal.
Somewhere in the small print, as long as a company makes
very clear that they are behind that particular service, that their brand is running it.
Consumers have to have eagle eyes to spot that sort of stuff.
If you saw a warranty company, for example, AA Warranty,
you would assume it was with one of the world's biggest, trusted brands. But it might not be?
Absolutely. Certainly it's going to lead to customer confusion.
A lot of people will buy a product because they think
they're buying the brand values that maybe is available elsewhere and actually can be very disappointed
when actually the service doesn't live up to their expectations.
It's a two edged sword.
If that company is not providing a really good service, the brand itself can ultimately suffer.
I think you summed it up for me there.
Thank you for your time, really appreciate it.
This is fascinating. It's a working relationship where both businesses benefit.
But what about the consumer?
So far, I've got the ball rolling with TMO and AA Warranties
but where I'm a little bit confused is all this white labelling business.
Where does it end? As far as I know, until now the AA put their name to lots of
different products but, the thing is,
surely we have the right to proper information about what we're buying?
Let's see what the public think.
This is a little experiment I've come up with to see how white labelling works on the consumer.
First up, brand names.
How important is product brand names for you?
Quite important, yes. It's something you're supposed to be able to trust.
It really reveals the truth and the reality
of the product and also the company that's advertising it as well.
A brand will give you an identification.
It certainly will. 'OK, Brands are important, you trust them.
'So what does the AA brand stand for with these guys?'
You've heard of AA,
everybody has, sum up the AA for me, what do they do, who do they represent?
Well, they are supposed to be the car breakdown people,
to help you when you're in trouble on the roads and motorways.
I think it's Automobile Association.
Spot on. Ten out of ten for you.
  Rescue me.
  They're the motor company, aren't they?
Breakdowns, car breakdowns, helping people that are in distress, motor wise.
  Who you can trust, really.
'Trust, rescue, help, all words these people associated with the breakdown service's brand name.
'So time for a little white labelling of my own.'
Now if you were buying something, let's say a satellite navigation system, in a shop.
And one said AA satnav and then the next one along was
exactly the same satnav but no name on it, which one would you go for?
I'd certainly look at the AA one.
  Yeah, probably the AA one.
That goes with AA. That's all to do with help.
If you saw one with AA on it you'd prefer it to one next door with no name on it?
  Yes.
  OK. Why's that?
  Because we know them and we trust them, yeah.
  'So there you have it.
'White labelling working on consumers before your very eyes.
'But I think it's best that we also hear it from the horse's mouth.'
  Is Ian Crowder there, please?
  'Speaking.'
'I've called up Ian Crowder, the gentleman from the AA who first e mailed me about white labelling.
'So, what does he think about it and does he think it benefits the consumer?'
Because companies are selling different products with your name on,
people are not aware that it's not actually the AA.
Consumers seem to think that it's AA,
the name of the company they trust,
so, to me, it seems a little bit unfair
that people might be purchasing something like the warranty
and it's not actually your company.
'The terms and conditions and so on will say who actually supplies it, in the same way that, for example,
'if you buy an AA savings plan you will be aware of who actually the original provider of that service is.
'Of course, the product is adapted for the AA to meet our requirements
'and our terms and conditions.
'What you're actually getting is an AA product effectively manufactured by someone else.
'The same applies to warranties.
'If we want to provide a warranty product, we go and find something because we think it fits our
'product range, it's something that our customers want, it fits the ethos of the business,
'then we will go and find somebody who provides a product that meets that requirement.
'It's not as if somebody comes to us and says,
'"we've got a marvellous product, we want to sell it as an AA product." It doesn't work like that at all.'
I'm glad you explained that. 'Let's see where they draw the line.'
Would you say, for example, put your name to
a satellite navigation system if you were happy with the product?
'Well if we wanted to offer one then we would find somebody who we
'trusted to offer it and we would sell it as an AA product.
'That is a purely hypothetical example.'
Yeah, they're all hypothetical, I just want to know where the line would be drawn.
Say it was hypothetically groceries, say, bananas,
and you wanted to start suddenly selling bananas, would you call it AA Banana, for example?
'We would only do that if we stood by the quality and price of the product.'
  'Somebody wouldn't come to us and say,
'"we've got fantastic bananas, we want to sell them with your brand name on them."'
'That just wouldn't happen.'
OK. Well that gives me an idea now. It could be any product as long as you're happy with the quality of it?
'Yes.'
Thanks, Ian. Bye.
AA bananas.
If I see those in a supermarket this time next year, I want a slice of the profits, I can tell you that.
Now I'm not trying to slip Ian up, it's all hypothetical,
but where the line gets drawn is probably down to us lot as consumers.
So, it's time to get back to the high street.
If there were two bananas for sale.
  One was unbranded and one said AA Bananas.
  No, I wouldn't buy that.
  Which would you go for?
  I'd go for the unbranded one.
  Would you?
  Yes.
I don't believe AA have anything to do with bananas, so I'd probably take the other ones.
The normal one that doesn't have an AA on.
Yeah. Not worried about a brand on a banana.
'Well, there you have it, folks.
'White labelling only works when collaboration between brand and manufacturer makes sense.
'For companies that deal with cars and motoring, satnavs are one thing, but bananas are quite another.
'The one thing I've learnt is that white labelling is everywhere,
'from credit cards to computers, and it doesn't look like it's ever going to go away.'
In an ideal world, I'd like to help out everybody who writes in.
But it would be much better if I could stop the problems happening in the first place.
And I have found some industry insiders who are prepared to expose
the rogues of their profession, and all in the name of making sure that you don't get done.
Builders, are they just like their stereotype?
They turn up late, if at all.
"Mine's a cup of tea, love, 19 sugars."
Sitting around all day reading the paper.
There's always an excuse and the job never finishes.
They're all the same, right? No, wrong.
Today's insider is a professional builder with over a decade's experience under his belt.
And nothing gets him more riled up than dodgy builders giving his industry a bad name.
Lifting the lid on bad building practices comes with its own risks.
To avoid retaliation from the rogues, he's asked to remain anonymous.
I've been in the building industry for 11 years now
and for the last seven years of that I've been running my own building company.
We've got lots of happy previous customers.
Some of those customers have had bad experiences with builders before and that does knock their confidence.
There are bad builders out there that are just out there to make a quick buck.
Luckily, my insider can tell you exactly what to look for to make sure you don't get done.
Things to look out for with a good builder
has got to be, number one, a detailed written quotation.
They will have lots of previous happy customers.
They will put a contract in place before any work goes ahead.
They will have experience in what you're asking them to do.
And they will have insurance as well.
A bad builder will ask for or a large payment up front.
They're probably not going to turn up when they say they're going to turn up.
They're going to be unwilling to give you a completion date.
They're going to have a disregard for their own safety and others around them.
And generally their work is going to be to a poor standard.
With bad builders, their slapdash approach can also extend to ignoring
the crucial involvement of the right building authorities.
I can think of two occasions, both garage conversions, where the garage
was actually being converted without building regulations.
It hasn't been checked by the building inspector.
This causes all sorts of problems for a customer when they come to sell their home,
as well as costing them money through heat loss
because things such as insulation have not been done to the correct standards.
So they're quite bad scenarios.
You don't really have any option then but to take out all of the work that's already been completed,
the vast majority of it, and then put it back in
to the correct specification and obviously under the watchful eye of a building inspector.
If you've employed a builder already and you don't think that their work is up to scratch, or you're not
happy with their service in any way, probably the best thing to do is try
to put a halt to the work and get some expert advice from the
Citizen's Advice Bureau or contact Trading Standards and try to work out the best way forward from there.
My top tip for anybody considering building work has got to be
do your research and get references and recommendations.
The vast majority of builders in our industry are good so, unfortunately, there are a few
that are kind of rogues and cowboys and don't do things the way that things should be done.
They're just there to make a quick buck.
And they don't really care about the next customer
because they will just end up doing the same thing to the next customer.
So now you know both the best and worst case scenarios to look out for when considering
getting the builders in, here's my insider's top tips:
visit an old job of theirs to see with your own eyes so you know it actually exists.
Get more than one quote.
If someone is really cheap, are at they cutting corners?
Do your research with the local council.
Does your job need any planning or building permission?
Also, check on the web to see if your builder has any county court judgments registered against him.
And finally, if you think you've got a cowboy bodge and leg it builder on your hands,
forget about being polite, tell them to hit the trail.
When I first took on Paula's case against her car warranty provider
TMO, I thought I'd have a mountain to climb to get her compensation.
Not being able to live without her wheels, she hired a car
and ended up £3,500 down for hire car costs.
Now, after several weeks of e mails back and forth debating
why this repair took so long, who's responsible and who should
pick up the bill, I finally get a number of someone at the company who may have the answers.
I've had an e mail from TMO about Paula's case.
It wasn't from the guy I spoke to called Ben,
it's from their claims manager, a guy called Peter.
He's given me his direct dial number. That's a result.
They're going to make an offer, I can feel it in my water.
But obviously I want to discuss it.
See exactly how much it is and what they're prepared to pay.
I don't think I'm in for a fight, either.
So far, I'm getting good vibes.
'We've held our hands up.
'We make mistakes.'
  Yes, every company does. I understand.
  'We are brave enough to recognise when we do.
'The fact of the matter is that the length of time this has gone on is unacceptable.
  'I'm carrying out a full investigation here as to why that happened.'
  Right.
'We've settled the claim.
'Substantial claim, as well.
'What else do you want us to do?'
I run through with Peter everything I think Paula is out of pocket.
But this amount of compensation has to go to the top.
'I'll have a word with the guy upstairs and I'll give you call back before 11:30 tomorrow.'
That's perfect, yeah. Take care, nice talking to you.
  Goodbye.
  'Goodbye.'
  "We are going to sort something out for her.
"I'll give you call back tomorrow
"and let you know what we're going to do to put a smile back on her face."
I don't know what it's going to be. I just hope it's not some flowers out of a service station.
But this one...
is going right my way and I like that.
While TMO planned their next move, I've decided that
Paula has had enough car trouble so I've decided to inject some excitement back into her driving.
TMO have been in touch and they've made a little offer for Paula, which I've got in this envelope.
I've asked her to come down here to meet me
where she's going to drive one of these cars and have a bit of fun.
I'm not going to tell you what they've given her yet. I think she comes first.
She's in for some fun.
But before the fun comes the finances. Time to fill Paula in.
Now, I do have a statement, which I'm going to get you to read.
Your car's fixed. It's paid for.
The warranty company have obviously suffered the loss of that and it's close to £4,500.
As a gesture of goodwill they would like to give you this cheque.
What do you think?
Well, it's nowhere near the £3,500 that I'm out of pocket, is it?
Well, that's what they wanted  
you to go out and treat yourself to something nice.
  Well, it won't, it will go on paying off the debt that I've got because I had to pay out £3,500.
  Yeah.
You were hoping for a lot more?
Well, I was not... Just the money I paid out, basically.
  Never mind. You tried.
  At least you can put closure on it, can't you.
Well look, I've got a little statement in here. Hang on, hang on, there's another cheque in there.
No!
Oh, thank you.
  You're nasty.
  How am I nasty?
I've just given you.. Hang on a second, there's four grand there. What do you mean I'm nasty?
I can't believe you did that to me.
Oh, no, that's lovely.
The thing was I didn't want to be out of pocket. I couldn't afford to be.
Right. That covers your out of pocket expenses.
The 500 quid is something to treat yourself to something nice with.
  That's lovely.
  Yeah?
  Yeah, thank you.
  They also, funnily enough, wanted you to have those as well.
TMO have really come up with the goods, but I'm not one to be outdone
so I've arranged another surprise for Paula.
Don't worry, she's got a fully trained instructor with her
so this time we're making sure she's got all the cover she needs.
  Faster. Faster.
  Oh God.
  Faster. Faster.
Look at Paula go!
She is smoking.
Faster, faster.
In a statement to us, TMO have said they have since got
rid of one of the garages involved in Paula's case.
Good news. Hopefully, no other TMO customers will be left on the skids.
As far as the company are concerned,
they did well in the end but this is a message to all companies out there  
us public are getting pretty fed up of bad customer service.
Now and again you make mistakes and you pull your socks up again.
I'd just like to say a really big thank you to Dom for doing all this for me.
I never dreamt for one minute that he'd managed to get all of it back.
She's got a great big smile on her face.
Job done.
I'm off home, I think.
