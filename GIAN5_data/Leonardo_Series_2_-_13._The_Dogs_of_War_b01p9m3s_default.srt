You killed my father, you dog!
And this is how you repay my trust?
Steady, Your Grace.
I'll hang you myself and enjoy watching you die!
Guards!
Bind him and take him to the jail.
So, Leonardo, it would appear that you've won.
What happened? Are you OK?
Listen! Listen to me...
No... No...
Piero de' Medici did this to me.
He He's behind it all. He poisoned the Duke.
No. I thought that at first.
But the assassin used the same kind of poison to kill the doctor.
Piero knew you were onto him.
It was all staged.
It was all for you.
You're saying...he had the doctor killed just to put me off the scent?
Should have treated me better.
So all this, Milan wanting to start a war...
Lies. Milan didn't kill the Duke, Piero did.
  But they kidnapped Lorenzo.
  No. They didn't.
  His own son?
  Lorenzo will never believe it.
  Let's get him on the bed.
  Or maybe a nice comfy blanket on the floor...?
  < Aggh!
  OK, OK, the bed!
  He got me to build him a superweapon.
  So he could attack Milan.
And all of Europe. He wants to be emperor.
We need to get him a doctor.
  I'll go.
  So what do we do about Piero?
We stop him.
What's this?
I thought you were finished?
I had.
  I'm sabotaging it.
  What?
Piero de' Medici, he's a traitor.
He killed your father. And he plans to kill you.
Ridicolo! My own uncle!
  I can prove it.
  Silenzio! I will not listen to this treason!
Repair it.
I can't do that.
You'll fix the superweapon. Or you'll die here and now.
Over there.
So   two traitors.
Who wants to die first?
Santa Maria! It's Duke Rocco! What have you...?
I can't explain. Do you trust me?
You need to let us take care of this.
All right. But I hope you know what you're doing.
Leonardo.
Your Excellency, I have something of yours.
Where did you get that?
  Placidi.
  Yes.
Just listen.
< He told me you poisoned the old Duke
and that there are traces of poison on this handkerchief.
Poison. Really? And what else did he say?
That you intend on conquering many cities with my weapon.
I see. And who have you told about this?
No one. I wanted to give you the chance to deny it.
That's very decent of you.
I suppose I could deny it.
But what would be the point?
I already have everything I want.
So it's true?
Of course it's true.
I'm the ruler that Florence needs.
Me.
Not that old duffer I killed.
And certainly not that imbecile of a son.
But you and I, Leonardo, we're thinkers, men of the future.
I am nothing like you.
  Aren't you?
  No!
I'm one of the few who appreciates, who understands a mind like yours.
And now I have to kill you.
You killed my father, you dog!
This is how you repay my trust?
Steady, Your Grace.
I'll hang you myself and enjoy watching you die!
Guards!
Bind him and take him to the jail.
So, Leonardo, it would appear that you've won.
But before you start your celebrations,
there is just one little thing.
I've been paying your men for months. They work for me now.
You snake! You poisonous...
You're right. Maybe we're not so alike after all.
You make plans.
I make plans within plans.
Your Excellency, we found these hidden back there.
The gearwheel.
And the flint that fires the gun.
Fix it.
Put these back.
Now!
Kill that boy.
Leo!
Interesting moral dilemma, isn't it?
Let your friend die and you could stop me, save thousands of lives.
Obviously, it's the right thing to do.
But I don't think you've got the stomach for it.
Let's find out, shall we?
On three.
Uno...
Leo!
Due...
Stop!
Stop!
I'll fix it!
Ah, Leonardo, you are so predictable.
Spread the word  
tell the people that we've just captured some Milanese spies.
Is it just me or is this quite depressing?
Guard the superweapon. No one gets near it.
Yes, Your Excellency.
I was planning a courageous death for Rocco on the battlefield.
But this is better. I will kill him and say that the spies
Leonardo da Vinci and Niccolo Machiavelli did it.
Where are they? I'll kill them all! They'll rue the day they...
Porca miseria!
Indeed.
I gave him the perfect weapon.
You shouldn't have fixed it. You should have sacrificed your friend.
Cheers.
Lorenzo!
Provisions, men. It's hungry work watching over these traitors.
Ah Leo, how could you? To betray your own city.
Bottomless stupidity   thy name is Lorenzo.
Are you really so blind?
My father told me everything.
You planned to surrender our army to the Milanese.
Liar! The filthy, lying, murdering scoundrel!
  Why would he do that?
  To save his own skin, of course.
And you, Leonardo,
you went along with it and sabotaged our superweapon  
just because you're squeamish about shedding Milanese blood.
  Lorenzo...
  I'll have nothing to do with a traitor.
Why are they...?
Sleeping? That would be the potion I put in their beer.
Placidi! What are you...?
You're hurt! It's OK, I'll fetch my father.
No! He'll kill me.
You're feverish. I have to get help.
Stop. I'm begging you.
He will kill me.
I know too much.
He'll stop at nothing.
He had you kidnapped.
What?
The man who kidnapped you... I hired him.
  On your father's orders.
  Why on earth would my father do that?
So he could blame Milan.
Ridicolo.
I can prove it.
You were taken to a house on Via Trento...
which your father owns.
This is the key to the door.
There were two.
The kidnapper had one, and I had the other.
You're lying.
He would never do that.
I know you're lying.
But before you start your celebrations, >
there's just one small thing.
I've been paying your men for months. They work for me now.
You snake! You poisonous...
Is it just me or is this quite depressing?
Traitor!
Ready the men immediately. We march at noon.
Where's Duke Rocco?
He's busy. Inspecting the cavalry.
We didn't start this. The Milanese killed our Duke.
They kidnapped you   my own son.
That I can never forgive.
Have courage. It will soon be over.
Their swords.
What about me?
Cheers.
I heard my father say they march at noon.
  Not if I find him first. Treacherous...
  Forget Piero!
We need the superweapon. If we have that, he's finished.
Hey!
I'll stop my father!
Stay back! I've got a mug and I'm not afraid to use it!
So...you know?
You're my blood...stand with me.
I can't.
Very well.
Out of my way, I'm leaving.
No. I won't let you.
We both know you won't use that.
My father   he's gone. I'm sorry.
The superweapon. We have to get to it before he does.
Get back!
  Leonardo! They said you'd been arrested. Are you all right?
  Yes...
..and no.
Santa Maria!
Piero de' Medici is in that machine and he has betrayed Florence!
Fire on him! ..I said fire!
I can't believe I'm going to die bravely in battle. It's just not me.
Arrivederci, Duke Rocco.
It didn't work?
You're not... Are you disappointed?
It should fire perfectly every time. I don't understand...
Maybe something to do with this?
Presto, Dottore! Signor Placidi is badly wounded.
Is it just me or is this quite depressing?
You'll have to go alone. 64 Via Barolo! Now hurry!
Out! No one is allowed in here!
  But I...
  Out! Go on!
What now? Oh, it's just the cleaning girl.
Catch!
Huh? Porca!
Come along now, missy. We don't want any trouble.
A couple of points. Uno   don't call me missy.
And due   I do want trouble. Lots of it.
Andiamo! We don't get paid enough for this. Move it!
The flint that sparks the gunpowder! You took it out. Fantastico!
Rocco!
I'm going to make you beg for mercy.
Just like your father did.
It's page one of the fencing manual   never lose your temper.
Duke Rocco is a traitor!
He ordered the murder of his own father!
And these are his allies!
Seize them!
Now!
What are you doing? Get off me! Get off me!
  Get off me!
  Get off... Leo!
Leonardo...I'm going to enjoy this.
You know I've always admired you, Leonardo.
But you've caused me no end of trouble....
So now I'm going to kill you very, very slowly.
Aaaaah!
You're the killer, not me!
Arrest Piero de' Medici on a charge of high treason!
No! No! It is Duke Rocco who has betrayed us!
I am Lorenzo de' Medici
and I say to you all...
..that my father is the traitor!
Lorenzo...!
All Florence owes you a great debt, Leonardo.
I didn't do it on my own.
We are grateful to you all. You have saved many lives.
To Leonardo! The boy who saved Florence!
Leonardo! Leonardo!
I'm never going to hear the end of this.
Your father... you know, he really does love you.
The love of a man like that...
you think it's worth having?
I'm proud of you, mate. Come on!
I'm proud of all of you.
Gaoler!
I need you to deliver something for me.
You have children.
You wouldn't want anything to happen to them, would you?
