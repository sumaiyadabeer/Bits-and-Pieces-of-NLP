Well, we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cos they found new toys
Yeah, we can't salute ya, can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya, that's a drag
School's out for summer
School's out for ever
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils, no more books
No more teacher's dirty looks, yeah, yeah
Well, we got no class
And we got no principals
We ain't got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes
School's out for summer
School's out for ever
My school's been blown to pieces
No more pencils, no more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer, out till fall
We might not come back at all
School's out for ever
School's out for summer
School's out completely
My school's been blown to pieces.
"I'm going to try and work a new number on you that's one of the band's own arrangements."
A thing called Miss Judy's Farm. It goes like this.
Miss Judy, she was moody
But she never ever got her own way
She used to get me in the cornfield mid afternoon
And by the time she was gone it was late
Miss Judy, she could have me
Any hour of the working day
She'd get me in the corn field mid afternoon
And by the time it was finished it was late
Miss Judy had a cross eyed poodle
That I would kick if I was given the chance
Never was amused by the kindness I used
I was kicked in the barn until dawn
Get down!
Last summer we was restless
We're going to burn down the farm if we can
But it was all in the head
'Cos out in the yard
Miss Judy had the National Guard
Miss Judy, she was moody
But she'd never even get her own way...
Whoo!
  I think we got something then.
  What?
  I think we got something then!
  What are you doing?
  Que?
Madame, don't think me rude but may I ask, do you by any chance have a hearing aid?
  A what?
  Yes, I do have a hearing aid.
  Would you like to me to get it mended?
I'm a bad, bad, boy
And I'm going to steal your love
Said I'm a bad, bad, boy
And I'm going to steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I'm going to rip you off
Well, I made my first kill with the old town girl
She was the apple of her daddy's eye
Well, that woman looked up at me
And I said, honey we'll be
Together till the day I die
But I lied
I'm a bad, bad, boy
And I'm going to steal your love
Said I'm a bad, bad, boy
And I'm going to steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I'm going to rip you off
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, boy
I'm said I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad,
I'm such a, such a bad, bad boy
I'm gonna rip you off
Mistreating son of a gun!
I'm a bad, bad, boy
I'm gonna steal your love
You know I'm a bad, I'm bad,
I will steal your love
I'm gonna rip you off
Mistreating son of a gun
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm so bad
I'm a bad boy
I'm gonna rip you off
Mistreating son of a gun.
I'm sorry. I'll say that again.
A pop group in full voice, as it were, can produce just about the same amount of noise
as a 707 thundering a few hundred feet overhead.
For the people who come here,
the sheer volume of noise is one of the main attractions.
Indeed, the whole pop movement has relied so much upon the staggering power of modern amplifiers.
Oh, yeah
Well, I take whatever I want
And baby, I want you
You give me something I need
Now tell me I got something for you
Come on, come on, come on and do it
Come on and do what you do
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
Oh, yeah!
Well, it's late and I want love
Love that's gonna break me in two
Don't you hang me up in your doorway
Don't you hang up like you do
Come on, come on, come on and do it
Come on and do what you do
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love, all right!
You know! I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love, baby
I'm gonna say it again
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough, enough of your love, baby
I can't get enough of your love
I tell you, baby
Ooh, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
Ooh! I can't get enough of your love...
In the beginning
Back in 1955
Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show
And all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
But no one knew what they was going to do
But Tchaikovsky had the news
He said, let there be light
And there was light
Let there be sound
And there was sound
Let there be drums
There was drums
Let there be guitar
There was guitar
Whoa! Let there be rock
Let it roll
Let it rock
And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowin' up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There was 15 million fingers
Learnin' how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar
Wah! Let there be rock
Oh!...
Help us. Help us, please.
Come inside. There are more of them in the compound.
Guess who just got back today?
Them wild eyed boys that had been away
Haven't changed, haven't much to say
But man, I still think them cats are great
They were asking if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
I told them you were making a living downtown
Driving all the old men crazy
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
You know the chick that used to dance a lot
Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
I mean that she was steaming
That time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't want to know, forget her
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back)
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
If the boys want to fight, you'd better let them
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favourite song
These nights are getting warmer, it won't be long
It won't be long till summer comes
And the boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
And the boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
Spread the word around
The boys are back in town.
(The boys are back in town.)
I was raised
A gambler's son
And before I could walk
I had to learn how to run
And I never, never ever
Played a loaded dice
But I rolled a lot of women
With a heart as cold as ice Yeah
On the road again
Looking for a place to hide
And everywhere I look, there is trouble
Trouble always comin' my way
Trouble always comin'...
Better believe it
Ohhhh oh oh oh
Mama
Baby I'm lonely
On the run again
Lookin' for a place to hide
Everywhere I look, there is trouble
Trouble always comin' my way
I'm lonely, man
Ooh, yeah
Ohhhh
Ah...
Trouble always comin' my way
Trouble always comin'
I believe
Always the same
Trouble always comin' my way
Ooh, yeah
Trouble always comin'
Oh, I can't change my evil ways
Ooh, yeah
Oh
Oh
Yeah
Mmmm, mmm mm mmm
"Top Gear" THEME TUNE
Hello and a very good evening to you. Welcome to Top Gear once again.
Tonight, Angela Rippon will be reporting from Donington race circuit
and I shall be giving my opinion of the Chrysler Sunbeam TI.
People going nowhere
Taken for a ride
Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme
Snow White's mirror said, "Partners in crime!"
Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold back, till it's ready, taking it slow
Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die
Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us a dime
There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
