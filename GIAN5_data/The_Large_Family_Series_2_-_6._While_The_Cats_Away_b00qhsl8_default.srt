A nice big splash of water for you.
Just a few drops for you, dear.
And just a sprinkle for the very smallest pot.
Oh, I'm sorry I won't be there to see all of you bloom.
  Can I help, Mum?
  It's kind of you to offer, Sebastian,
but I'm afraid you're too young.
What if something disastrous happened to my flowers?
  But...
  Oh! No buts! Now, have you packed your case?
Yes, Mum.
Good boy.
Linda! Linda? Are you there, dear?
  A hem!
  Larry, what exactly are you doing?
  Actually, I, um...
  Oh! What beautiful flowers, Larry!
What's your secret?
How did you and Linda manage to get them to grow so well?
Do you use a lot of chemicals?
Chemicals? Good gracious, no!
  A lot of water?
  Well, I do water them, but...
Ah, there you are, Linda.
A long way away and very expensive, but so lovely.
What about you? What will you do?
We've been to the seaside for a week
so we'll spend the rest of the holidays at home as usual.
  It'll be lovely.
  Hmm. Whatever makes you happy.
But I'm glad you'll be at home. You see, I need your help.
Hmm.
So, it's half a canful for this one,
but you're so good with flowers, you know all about that.
Me? Oh, no, I'm not a flower expert. It's Larry who does all that.
I'm relying on you, Linda.
Anyway, I've written it all down here, just in case.
I water these flowers every day, you know.
I treat them as if they were my children.
One day, they'll be the most beautiful flowers
  in the neighbourhood!
  Hmm.
  Goodbye!
  Bye!
When's Sebastian coming back, Mum? It's so quiet without him.
If you spend the whole time waiting for him, it'll drag even more.
  Here, why don't you help me with the watering?
  Thanks!
It's not so bad spending the holidays at home.
I know, but they went by so fast. Tomorrow the Smarts will be back.
Ah! Oh, Mrs Smart's flowers!
I nearly forgot. Oh, I really don't feel like it today.
That's all right, Mum! We'll take care of them, won't we?
That's sweet of you, Luke, but Sheena did ask me to do it.
But I like watering plants. You showed me how the other day.
You could have a rest. Please, Mum?
Then we can play with Sebastian's new football. He said we could.
If anything happened to her flowers, she'd never talk to me again.
We'll just follow the instructions. I've seen you do it.
I'd love to let you do it but...
Can't you trust us, Mum? Please!
How do you expect us to grow up if we never do grown up stuff?
Well, I suppose, if you promise you'll be really careful.
  Yeah! Thanks, Mum!
  Thank you, Mum!
Don't worry, dear. They'll be fine.
One quarter of a can.
  How much is a quarter, Lester?
  Not much.
Come on, Luke. You've been watering for ages. Get a move on!
But Mum said to be very careful.
I'll be finished in a minute.
Come on, Luke. Hurry up.
Here, this will be quicker.
  Are you sure, Lester?
  Of course. The more water, the better.
  Ha ha!
  Ha ha!
I don't think Mrs Smart is going to be very happy.
  She goes crazy even over a tiny speck of dirt!
  We'll have to wash them.
Don't you think they're wet enough already?
We should call Mum.
Wait   I've got an idea.
Oh...
Yesterday I was winning by eight goals to two. First one to ten wins.
Oh, no!
Oh, yes.
  Maybe cleaning them with washing up liquid wasn't a good idea.
  Maybe.
  Unless we fixed this.
  How? Mum will be furious with us!
She'll only be furious if she knows.
What do you mean, Lester?
  Hmm.
  Can we go and buy some sweets at the shop?
Well, I don't know.
Do you deserve sweets?
It is the last day of the holidays, after all!
Oh, all right, then, but don't be too long.
  Yay!
  Hooray!
You do sell potted flowers, right?
Indeed I do.
But we can't see them.
I never stock them in summer. It's not the planting season.
Those flowers would go really nicely in Mrs Smart's flowerpots.
  No, Luke. We can't.
  Why not? There are so many of them.
The owners wouldn't notice if one or two went missing.
Hello, boys. Can I help you?
  No, thanks. We're fine, just looking at your beautiful flowers.
  Hmm.
What are we going to do?
Can't you go any faster, Laura? The Smarts will be home any minute now.
Thank you, Laura. You're a real help.
I still think you should have told Mum and Dad about this.
What exactly are you doing there?
Where are Sheena's flowers?
Poor flowers!
Oh, I knew it.
It was my job to water Mrs Smart's flowers,
I shouldn't have left you to do it. You're too young. It's my fault.
No, it's not, Mum. We promised we'd do it properly but we messed it up.
We wanted to fix it ourselves.
  Nevertheless, you should have told me right away.
  Sorry, Mum.
  Sorry.
Is this Laura's work?
Well, it's certainly... um...different.
But I must admit they look even nicer than Mrs Smart's flowers.
Really, Dad? You really think so?
I do, though I'm not sure Sheena would agree with me.
  Oh, no!
  Oh, no!
Well, I did love Laura's flowers but...
We've really messed up. What will we tell Mrs Smart tonight?
That it was all our fault. We just have to own up.
Hmm, I suppose they're not TOO bad.
They look quite healthy but these aren't the most important ones.
Oh! Wait! We can explain everything.
Huh?
Ooh! They're even more beautiful than Larry's!
How did you get my plants to flower like that, Linda?
Actually, you should ask Larry.
Are those your flowers, Dad?
Yes, they are but I much preferred your arty faded cardboard ones,
  so I planted them in our garden.
  Thank you, Dad!
I now have the most beautiful flowers in the neighbourhood.
You haven't been using any chemicals, have you, Larry?
  Oh, no!
  Lots of water? Little spray?
No, no. That's much too complicated for me.
Well, tell me, then! What DO you do?
Um, nothing special. I, um...
I sing to them.
