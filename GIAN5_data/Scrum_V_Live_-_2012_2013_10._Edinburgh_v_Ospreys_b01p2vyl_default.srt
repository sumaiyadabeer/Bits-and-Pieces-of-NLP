Stoo we've had some grim weather recently and to make things worse,
there's an All Black storm coming. Hurricane Hansom was torn from
to hit Wales. It's time to pull together. We must unite to survive.
The fans, the players, the country! And while this nation waits for
blackness to descend on Cardiff, Scrum V Live comes from Scotland.
It is on nights like that, who you find out who the stars for the
future are. Ospreys must visit Murrayfield, where we know
Edinburgh can push him into the playoff zone for the first time
this season. So the proprois back after a two week break. Come the
Ospreys, to restore Edinburgh pride. The form book suggest they can.
They won five in a row and up against a Edinburgh side hovering
near the bottom of the table with two wins to their name. Yes, hello,
and good evening to a wind swept and rainy Murrayfield in Edinburgh.
Scrum V Live is coming live from the Scottish capital. The big news
is Dan Carter is out. We'll talk about that at half time. But first,
opportunity to pick up points. is a huge opportunity for Ospreys
to come away with four or five points. It shows you the strength
of their squad, with the likes of Bishop, Bearman and chuck in the
silent talents of Walker, mother mother mother, two youngsters with
plenty to play for tonight. Murrayfield, Edinburgh, is a huge
field, it is so wide, if they get the ball in their hands, they can
be dangerous. Hopefully, we'll exploit the wide open spaces. A
similar face with Richie Rees? Experienced, a real campaigner, in
terms of the RaboDirect Pro 12 and Celtic league, he is busy,
industrious player, he is cemented a number nine Jersey, he made it
his own, if they have any chance of winning the game he is fundamental
to that. He is a key member of the side. Of course, you have Ross Ford,
you have Roddy Grant and some experience on side, but it is a
very young Edinburgh side. The likes of Richie Rees is so
important. OK, the teams are about to enter the field of play. We have
had plenty of commentary options for you, they're accessible via the
BBC Wales website. Log on, and you can hear Rick O'Shea and Jed Thien
in the RedZone, and you have commentary on the BBC website. Here
we have Scott Hastings and Gareth Charles. Thanks very much Ross.
Conditions better for the moment anyway. The rain, heavy showers we
had earlier, have abateed, as Joe Bearman leads the Ospreys out on to
Bevington and Lloyd Peers back from duty. Williams making his debut.
Bosch Bosch plays for more games for Ospreys tonight than any other
player in the region's history. Walker, such a daing remember.
Edinburgh side, who want to be climbing up the table, so
successful in Europe last year, but struggled in the RaboDirect Pro 12
as they are currently, languishing Sean Cox skippering the Edinburgh
side. Ross Ford released from international duty, and John Yapp
and a couple of South Africanss, Izak van der Westhuizen. Richie
Rees a former Osprey up front. Tom Brown, latest cap in June. And a
lot of youngsters on the bench, more than 30 somethings, with 50
companies,    caps, like Gough for the Ospreys.
David Wilkinson rev, the man in charge this evening, as Ospreys
Scotland in action in Aberdeen Scotland in action in Aberdeen
tomorrow. In the home of Scottish rugby, Murrayfield, it is Edinburgh
this evening. Rhys Webb looking to bring Tom Isaacs into action early,
but well claimed by Stuart McInally and got away from a couple of
Osprey defence as well. Luckily for the visitors, they're the ones who
get the first penalty. After 40 seconds under the cosh, it may be
relief for them as well. Positive start with Stuart McInally taking
the ball well. It was the isolated man, and that's
why he was penalised for not releasing the ball in the tackle.
Ospreys have an opportunity to clear the line. How often do we see,
Ford isolated man, no Edinburgh support there, as a result they had
to hang on to the ball, wait for the support, but the referee got
his line early, and didn't know Morgan slippped for him. Otherwise
it would be a different route for him. Webb, again, the tactic, is to
bring Isaacs on to the ball. It didn't work the first time but
no runners back to them on this occasion Nicely done there.
The tackle was easy in the end for Brown. Let's have a look at Walker.
A lot expected from him on the wide spanss of Murrayfield. Bishop, well,
a guy winning his 181st appearance for Ospreys S a great record and it
is that type of experience that Ospreys want to latch on to this
evening. Nicely presented lineout ball. Stowers at the heart of the
defence. Stowers with the pick and go around the corner. Walker had
drifted over to the right hand side, he now makes his way back to
customary left wing position. Ospreys lose the ball and chance
scrum half converted to centre. But tonight they're appearing on the
used the turnover, so scrappy play from the Ospreys, but interesting
that Ospreys have chosen to kick the first two positions with a high
ball, trying to put Edinburgh under a little bit of pressure. There was
a heavy rain storm about 45 minutes before kick off. Maybe the surface
is slightly greasy, so looking to capitalise on Edinburgh's mistakes.
There you see the towel extra heavy hand, wipe the ball, to make sure
the surface of the ball is clean. Good steal by Peers. He will be 22
in February, very interestingly, called up to train with the Welsh
squad ofrt last couple of weeks, after injury to Jones, he started
one game this season, so they're the initial ball carrier. There's
so much of that, so does Bearman. David Wilkinson rev sharp at the
breakdown area. That time it is against Ryan Bevington, not staying
on his feet, going down in support of the ball carrier, Joe Bearman
other touch line as opposed to the natural touch line, off his right
for the left footer. Nowadays, a lot go to go in on the kicking, to
make sure it is a safe touch rather than a spiral. They're looking for
initial. Tackle is well low down by Williams. Plenty of width from
Edinburgh. Fife, wasn't held Rees stumbled on the ball as he
released the phase position there. Rees I was speaking to him last
Saturday, and he's enjoyed his experience at Edinburgh, but
ultimately Edinburgh have won two games, they've been white washed in
the Heineken cup, the team have not fired him with the two winness the
Rabo they viewed this game important to get the confidence
back, and it can set them up for is a 30 year old making ace Rabo
direct debut. Injury, Jones jerd and Rees picked up an injury as
well. So, tight heads few and far involved in the LV cup, a win over
Gloucester and an exciting prospect for the Welsh region. Still only 20.
Biggar, injured, but they're hoping he will be fit enough to face
Australia next week. He got a real Ospreys? A loss pass, the angle of
running and that's the second error Ospreys have had. The first was
from Andrew Bishop when he overran the pass, another jove run. Players,
we were talk before the start of the game, how important
concentration and focus is, both occasions, that the man was
receiving the ball overrun the pass, and suddenly you creep on the ball
because it's not delivered swiftly. These errors, not only frustrate
Murrayfield. It is a cold night but often difficult when you've only
three or four thousand supporters, to create an atmosphere, in a
take on Tonga, and Scotland desperate to finish oft Autumn
campaign to get them up in the Six Nations.
They've beat Samoa, Fiji and took the Of as traila, but all that
optimism hoped for in the Autumn series against South Africa,
there's glimpses the way they've built the team but from the
Scotland perspective, the mistakes. Australia is one of the top teams
of delivering and putting away teams. Wales tomorrow, after last
Friday, there sure will be concerns, but real optimism when Warbutons
laid down the marker, saying "we can beat Australia". We've been
hoping since 1953, that's the unfortunate thing. A scrum is
already turning into a bit of a mess, in the opening dozen minutes,
that's the third or fourth one that's gone down. Interesting, you
say we've been waiting 1953, Scotland have yet to beat New
Zealand. I've played, and got chosen a couple of occasions but it
was always the You want to take, so Wales will expect that. Back to
this game, between Ospreys and Edinburgh. An opportunity for Ford
to feed the lineout. And for Edinburgh to build phases of
chasing, what a tackle by Rees. Full back Greig Tonks is getting
there, but Rees did so well to bring Morgan down. It is inch 
perfect but good cover. We've seen a number of errors, off the back of
the line. Here is Richie Rees on to Stuart McInally, and Matthew Morgan,
read it well, he is showing the pace there, but Richie Rees what a
super tackle to put his man on the deck.
But it is the errors costing these teams, not only possession, but
ball. Richie Rees won't thank Isaacs for that. A penalty decision
hold of the ball there. In comes his opposite man, Rhys Webb tries
to get the ball. There seems to be a bit of stamp on Richie Rees'
shoulder, but the referee was right there, have to let go of the ball.
Frustration creeping in from Richie between the posts. After a scrappy
error in the first quarter of an hour, Matthew Morgan gets the first
points. First time this evening we'll look for you in the crowd.
Thank you very much. So I'm just in respect to Bill
McClaren. There's barely 2,000 for people here. It makes it more
difficult, it's a great stadium on international day when it is full,
but the atmosphere is lost with the 3,000 people here. It is similar to
the Blues at the city stadium, it is the Edinburgh team I feel sorry
for. As a rugby player, you feed off the crowd, you lose it here.
What wins games like this, preinternational, not in Vogue,
people forgot the game is on. weather is a big factor tonight.
The ball is greasy, a lot of knock  ons and loose play. The biggest
threat is the defence. That's going to win the game tonight. You can't
throw long balls, they're so good at it, they trained so hard, that
will be the difference. Elsewhere, Dragons, 3 0 down. Find a seat!
Thanks. Thanks Phil. Dangerous ball. I think you could feel the smack in
the ribs. It was a tentative grab to say the least. Interesting
watching Gregor Hunter, it is the loopy high ball, that does nobody
any favours. Edinburgh's game is slick passing game. We've seen
glimpses of it tonight. First look at Visser, who signed early on this
to the try line. Regional club, or international level as well by the
look of him. Andrew Bishop making up for the ten
metre line and straight through as the defence tries to fan out in
midfield and close down runners. That's James King, one on either
side this evening. Second row, and Edinburgh, both have James King.
real glimpse of Isaacs' handoff and pace. It is the first time Ospreys
managed to get the ball through with confidence. Shrugs off the
need to go for the back door pass there, and word of apology to Tom
Isaacs. They call it out of the bread basket. Point delivered
doesn't have basketballing skills, good sideburns though! Such a
feature, suspect it, a lot of the players support the good cause of
Movember. He looks like a music captain. Should have good hands
left footer, kicking to the left touch line, so finds a good touch.
There's the offending hand. often wonder why players do that,
they're on the deck, scrum half has ball in hand, of comes the hand,
let them have it, and it is the things that drives coaches crazy
isn't it? Well, vest vest vest is the go to man in the Edinburgh
lineout. Stuart McInally looking to trailer. King upended by Sam Lewis.
with a clearout, back to Hunter. King blind pass over the shoulder.
Stuart McInally was there The testing time for the Ospreys is
Edinburgh go through the phases retaining the ball well. As soon as
I said that, they lost it, but illegally so. The offences are
they're putting the ball on the Ospreys side, and that's the
second handing offence, rucks, when the ball has gone down.
Gregor Hunter has an opportunity to tie the game here. So again, a
little discipline creeping into the afternoon, 5.15, is Wales and New
Zealand. Scarlets and Munster on Sunday afternoon. Highlights all
the events on the weekend at 5.15 on Sunday evening. Poor skill there,
from the Ospreys. Eli Walker just overrunning the pass here, it's a
combination of both things, the man overrunning and being aware of the
fact of where the running man is, the support.
And a lack of concentration from both sides. It's been an error 
off his hand. The knock on turns up the ball so well. I've been
watching Fussell's positioning, he hugs the touch line so he puts
pressure on the opposition kicking alignment and so Fussell's
alignment absolutely superb, out of first tackle in. Walker, picking up
pace from a standing start. It is fairly static from the Ospreys at
the moment. Finding it tough work to get across that game line.
Sprotsprot looking to see, from a     Spratt looking to see a different
form, still catched outside the phases but getting little reward
for it at the moment. The reason is it is slow ball, you can't work off
the platform, it sets the alignment off on the picture and then to come
up and meet the tackler. Tifplt's all been happening outside
the Edinburgh 22. But they're confident enough not to put too
many in the tackling area and wait for the next one to come along.
then the other. Walker doing something at last. Lewis trying to
one thing you can say. It is all about patience now, can they build
and find the chink in the Edinburgh defence. It is all about discipline
for Edinburgh, not giving away a penalty after working so hard.
They've let the Ospreys have the ball and confident in their defence
capabilities for the last few minutes, and 25 phases now. Again a
show and go from Rhys Webb. Bevington takes it on. He was
closer but lost after all that effort. And Richie Rees bangs it
I thought that was done before he hit the deck. Well I was very, very
surprised, Dougie Fife is standing on his feet, he rips the ball out,
there was nothing wrong with that. Tackle assist is still allowed to
meet the tackle, that was perplexing. Still he doesn't go
down, he's on his feet. But here's the 27th phases of
possession, and then the turn yof, well, again, you look at that, Nick
Park is down on the ball. Perhaps the penalty should have been there?
The Ospreys may feel justice was eventually done. But it leaves
Matthew Morgan with a considerably more difficult penalty attempt.
Good strike. Excellent kick by Matthew Morgan and on the half hour
park, Ospreys edge their way back ahead. We often feel they go
through 27 phases of possession, you have to have something from
that pressure, there was a turnover from Edinburgh but loose kick from
Richie Rees allowed Walker to get in and get team mates involved and
eventually it was that, what was determined not releasing from the
tackle which allowed the Ospreys to nail their second penalty of the
game. Tonks angled it towards the far touch line. 27 phases for the
Ospreys, a lot in the Edinburgh 22, but one penalty how demoralising
would that be? Not demoralising, they're doing the right things, but,
you'd like to expect them to come away a little bit more, they have a
penalty on the 40 metre line, and it will be tight. How important is
if if they got a sniff you have to put it away. Anyone in the RedZone,
you need to come away with something, this game is full of
mistakes and turnovers and it is how you react to them. Back to you.
Thanks guys. The stakes could determine the outcome of this game.
We need a little bit of magic from turned to Hunter and Richie Rees in
support. That's the way to do it, Edinburgh! Make the ball do the
work, great passing and they get one.
It all stems from the lineout, of the top to John Houston, he got
overturn up to the ten yard line, that allowed the outside backs
space, because it was Nel, that took the ball on. This is good
handling from Tonks, inside pass, out of the tackle and then Gregor
Hunter got his hand to the ball to Richie Rees and Nel with hands on
the ball, second time in the movement and eventually the
continuity game, that Edinburgh are famed for, eventually got them over
the line. The first try, and that will give Edinburgh confidence.
Lovely pass initially from Hunter to Dougie Fife, and then the return
ball and good support work all around. I'm sure Richie Rees half
fans yeeed going for the corner, but Bishop was closing in on him
and Willem Nel former Cheetah's prop, gets his second of the season.
Funny one by Hunter, swerveed one way and then the other. But not
adding to the 5 from the try. tongs into Hunter,   Tonks into
Hunter, excellent play from the was blocking whose path is the
David Wilkinson rev, by the sound of the crowd, it will be a
it could have gone the other way. It was the confidential the side of
the touch line was that Jonathan Spratt impeded Sep Visser, so here
is Visser, he blocks the angle of running, but hand goes up
immediately. It is not clever play by Sep Visser, he goes straight for
his man. Yes, Jonathan Spratt ran the angle. Bishop, sorry. Ran the
deliberately blocked but the hand was definitely around the face and
that was charged by Webb. Everybody's missed the loose ball.
So here is a chance for the Ospreys, surely. Edinburgh defence have
play. They're not adverse to bumping off defenders, you can see
it with Bearman. Lewis. Quick ball is what they're looking for. Quick
release is what they should have given.
Webb, Bishop, mother mother mother is there.
  Matthew Morgan is there, not the way they planneded it, but they'll
take it anyway, and Matthew Morgan put the Ospreys back ahead. The

atmosphere, at pitchside, what did you say to the players? We spoke
about creating our own atmosphere, a great group training well and
creating something amongst ourselves. Cheers. Good awareness
from Rhys Webb, from the kick off, knew how close he was to the touch
line and stepped over, before receiving it, which put the Ospreys

actually across both teams. And obviously got his match in Richie

member of the back row getting time approaching, it will be safety
a believer in watching players, and one player that has been standing
out, he hits the target for the turnover, look at the way he steals
the ball there, excellent play by the Edinburgh open side. No time
for the lineout. Matthew Morgan has got all of the Ospreys points in
the first half after the penalty, got the try, and ended with the one
that scored was bi Nel, Ospreys will be relieved they did get that
score, because they'll have thought they worked hard enough to be ahead,
and that's what they are, at half time. Ospreys ran out to a muted
Murrayfield, about 3,000 people here in the Scottish capital, they
nudgeed away through Matthew Morgan with the first kick of the game.
Edinburgh kept in touch with one of their own. And Matthew Morgan beat
the Ospreys into a 6 3, until slick handling from the backs and
forwards in the move, Willem Nel the prop finishing off a slick move
indeed. And on the stroke of half time, Matthew Morgan hit back the
score of all the Ospreys points this evening. Ospreys in the lead
at half time. first 35 minutes, but exploded into
life now? Just when the game has come to life, it's half time, it's
come to life, it's half time, it's a shame.. There's not much space,
both defences have been well organised. The Ospreys tried to
score at the end, because they put a lot of pressure on Edinburgh
through the first half. Defence is very much on top, Edinburgh defence
proving difficult to breach, it was Edinburgh which scored with a
cracking try? Both defences is good. It was a case of isolating the two
forwards, with the Ospreys, and then it is a case of Visser, great
handling and support work, and obviously, of for a very well
worked try. The important thing was the lineout. You can see that
Baldwin, it is backs against forwards, and quality handling. We
haven't seen much tf, unfortunately, but the last ten minutes it's
started to come alive. It is instinctive, to expect a player to
be there, especially when you break the line, you get defenders flood
in, and suddenly there's room inside. Hard for Ospreys, but they
struck back? 27 phases, at one point and there's a lot of room
outside here. And I was shouting, the ball had to go wide, you can
see what Bishop is trying to do, but the offload kills the Edinburgh
attack. Offloads are so key. We see with New Zealand the offload game
they play, defence can't set. A great line for Morgan. They've gone
through a number of phases, weather isn't good in terms of ball
handling, they've kept it tight but patience paid dividends. We spoke
of Richie Rees and he put on a show tonight. He's had a busy night,
particularly in defence? He has been busy and veryous, again,
interception, he shows great pace here. And Matthew Morgan is a quick
man, there's only one thing he can do, and that's the ankle tap,
prevented a try, a good scrum half, understand, where he needs to be.
And again, showing awareness, and pace. He saves another try scoring
Ospreys attack. We mentioned it a few moments ago, the Edinburgh
defence, well structured, virtually impossible to break down, 27 phases
and the Ospreys barely moved forward, it is a well structured
defence isn't it? Both defences are well structured, there's not a lot
of room on wide at all. So both Ospreys and Edinburgh have to run
off nine and create the space. The way you create space is by running
off nine and turning the ball into quick ball, that draws defenders
this. It has been tight, and whatever defence comes out on top,
will win today. I agree, it isn't a classic, it's come to life in the
last ten minutes, we expect more, there is talent and pace there. As
the game breaks up, the likes of Walker, and Matthew Morgan, we'll
probably see more. The second half is coming up soon, and plenty more
coming over the weekend. Sport Wales follows us as 9pm. Justin
will offer frank Wales on Wales V New Zealand, and respects to Gary
Speed who died a year ago. We have a big event tomorrow, Wales versus
New Zealand, a big Test on BBC One, Now, we've not beaten New Zealand
for a long and painful, 59 years. Jed has taken a glance on how we've
faired since. It was in 53 and on black and white TV when we've taken
a win, Wales you were living the dream. 20 Years on when the side
beards were long, the try you recall wasn't for your shirt at all,
because it is not in this shot, just a tapy on the spot, and if
just a tapy on the spot, and if that's not a forward pass! Then our
mate, in 1978, that wasn't a dive that you saw, or not a good one
anyway. In the 80s, with the world at our feet, who came Falton the
Welsh destruction complete. On high, the long road, what your boyos,
changed code. In the 90s, Wales needed clout, so we had a look
about, and cleaned out the shelf and had the borrows as your save
yours. Whether Welsh you took on the lot, false profits, fake blood
lines, and a backpacker by Sinko, and in the noughties rolled in,
something new to begin, thanks to Hanson girth round and portly. We
felt Mojo, and boy look at you G wearing All Black, you beat All
Blacks. We played the dragon would slain, to blacker and best. Now
under Gattland, you see the Welsh side by side and eyes are flameing
for victory. Remember one thing, when you all start to sing. Fade
the black. Unmistakable and unique perspective of Jed there. That's
available on line and on the red call leaping into this? He played
well, possibly, at 15, Wales should have played him, it is where he's
comfortable at. It's a big ask for the wing. He played most rugby at
15, it koob simpler to put Harper. You can be exposed, I like the look
of this team. And whatever, performance is key this weekend,
whatever the result. One of the big talking point is the return of
Jonathan Davies at 13, he is much missed with a join injury, how much
of his return boost Wales' chances? It will boost them, because he's
probably the best midfield player, we have alongside Jamie Roberts, to
me, Priestland is good, he needs to play flatter and offer more of an
attacking play around him. Wales, there's no expectation on Wales
tomorrow. They go into this game more relaxed in some ways, and
hopefully they'll perform. They have to go out there. I expect a
committed performance and better performance from Wales. Let's have
a look at the New Zealand team. That was announced early this week,
it is formidable look at 15. They've experimented in the first
two tests on tour so far. Big news this evening, is that Dan Carter
has withdrawn from the New Zealand side. Cruden takes his play. It is
not a weakling? That's a massive team. That's a team full of world
class players. It shows Wales a sign of respect, they're picking
the strongest team against them. We've always caused problems in the
past, and they should be wary of Wales because these boys the Welsh
teams, they're big, fit and strong, they lack a little confidence, but
as soon as that comes together, it is not a foregone conclusion, but
performance is key this weekend. I mentioned earlier it's been
nearly 60 long years since we beat New Zealand but we have come close
on a couple of occasions never more so than back in 2004.
They must have numbers, Stephen Jones, Gareth on the inside,
Shanklin! Altogether more in suit, here you are? 25 26 the score, how
gutted were you to come that close and fall in the final Hurd snl That
was our best chance we've had in years. The hair started to go with
my pace. Both teams come off that field shattered, we had given our
all, unfortunately it wasn't enough. We played the All Blacks, two or
three times a year, and we've always seemed to perform in one
half, whether it is the first or second, the key to play the top
teams is to perform for 80 minutes. You can't put your foot off the gas.
That's what they do, they're consistent, and have a mentality,
whether they're down or out, at any stage they work their way back.
haven't beaten them in 59 years and Wales are desperate to, but on the
other side of the coin, New Zealand, will want to keep their record,
keep the 59 after beating to Wales. We can return to the encounter now,
and Ospreys have 40 minutes to push the playoff zone and maintain the
Thien is available on the touch of a button, you can listen to their
commentary. Welsh language commentary is available to our
website, too. But let's return to Scott Hastings and Gareth Charles.
No changes to either side during the interval. The one change in the
first half cease Houston for King, he's called up to the Scottish
sevens squad, he will be leaving to go to Dubai, and South Africa. Just
a warmer environment as opposed to Murrayfield. He will appreciate the
warm climbs   climes all the more. But at the moment it is the Ospreys
who kick off the second half with a five point lead, thanks to Matthew
Morgan. The game is very much balanced along the side two scrum
halfs, Richie Rees and Rhys Webb, I feel that Rhys Webb just edged it,
he's given Ospreys room, he's in behind the Edinburgh defence, so it
will be interesting to see how each coach rallied his team at half time
and what reaction the teams will have. Well again, poorly delivered
ball. The Ospreys getting in each Brown took it in the previous ruck.
Completely misread. A comedy of errors to start the second half.
Well the kick went up there, but, the commentators curse, Webb fooled
by that ball, and it's come good for Edinburgh. I suppose if that's
a knock on, technically it is an offside isn't it, because it didn't
touch anybody. There was problems in the scrum in the first 40
minutes, so hopefully, referee, David Wilkinson rev will sort this
What is so crucial in the engagement is that everybody is
looking for the edge in that third row. It is all about the hit,
getting the hit on each other, if that doesn't go well, it tends to
go down. You've got the added complication
that Yapp is six foot two, and Peers is five foot eight. It's gone
against David Wilkinson, his first card in RaboDirect Pro 12, yellow
Wilkinson rev will react on the scrum, and Williams sent to sin bin
for not binding on his man, his gap, drifting and it is staying
tap. Certainly Rhys Webb was aware the opportunity was on, but I must
say, Sean Cox in with a tackle, he was right up, and aware as well.
And forced the error. Edinburgh of course the extra man will be
desperate to score, especially with Gregor Hunter having just missed
that Ben nationality.   penalty. Ospreys have had to take off a back
row player to get on the replacement prop. And it is another
debutante, dear me, they're making his club rugby with Swansea, and
the tight head, but tight head on a seven man scrum. That was always
going to ask a lot. The pressure came on. Look at the left hand side
scrum, the pressure's on, well that's a tough baptism of fire, for
the youngster, Nicky Thomas. Gregor Hunter has an opportunity, they
will receive the kick off, are the Edinburgh players thinking
territory, divet the next scrum?    one straight down the middle and
Edinburgh looking to make a one man advantage work in their favour.
They're back within a kick. If you're 0 years of age plus VAT,

Wales W Gattland back, it will have a catalyst effect, you don't become

Alan TOames had the pass, he chose to give it from the boy from the
city, so it was a great, a big result for Scotland that particular
day, we hadn't won in Wales for 1 years, so I remember Eddie Butler
crying in the toilet. That's enough. There he is. Scotland legend,
Colder. Back to you. Must remind him of that, when I see him
tomorrow. Sean Cox driving on, and Edinburgh seem to have the bit
between their teeth at the moment. One man advantage, back in striking
distance, and they're the ones taking it to the Ospreys. Oh great
run from Fife, he timed it superbly, waited and wait and it hit the ball
well and causing problems. There's an overlap, should have gone wide,
massive overlap, two men were defending for the Ospreys. Now
they've a few more numbers back, that will help. Not out of trouble
yet. Yapp was there to receive the pass, from Richie Rees. Desperate
defence, they're hanging on by their fingernails. The ball comes
back again and out wide. Houston, spilt. Pressure relieved. Multi 
imphases for Edinburgh, look at this ening angle, they recycleed
the possession, but it was another loopy pass from Gregor Hunter, just
as his advantage was called over. And Houston, he won't want to see
that on the replay. But tipple Edinburgh, they spread defences but
wonderful angle from Fife. Watch Richard Fussell get back on his
feet, catches Rees, he was offside but on that occasion the Ospreys
come quickly enough for the Ospreys, and they have another three minutes
to go, only conceded the one penalty so far. Andrew Bishop, as
he often does, takes on the role of temporary flanker. I'm sure
Edinburgh will be having a word in the referee's ear, that the scrum
is collapsing on the far side. is Ross Ford down, the hooker.
Surprised, that he was dropped from the Scottish squad? It is a
difficult one to tell, Ross Ford hasn't played well, he will be the
first one to admit but doesn't give another combination for Scotland,
it probably does, but allows to find his bearings again and play.
There's a lot still to come from him, and he carried the ball well
on occasions, but sometimes that lineout throw cost him dear.
Sometimes as a player, if you not nailed your best game to the posts,
you will want to get out there, and be given another shot. New
combinations, up in Aberdeen scrummaging hooker. Obviously in
discomfort at the moment. Ospreys looking to add balance and
experience, bringing on Gough. Ford looks to be struggling, that could
be the end of the road for him. He's in a bit of pain. Obviously
the scrum, when it went down, it was awkward wasn't it.
Eli Walker, will be on there. Alum Walker on as Ford's
referee's Mike how confident Edinburgh are in the scrum.
They have to attack the scrum again, and down it goes again, and same
result again. Time against Bevington rather than on the Osprey
tight head. That's what Edinburgh want, get within kicking range for
Gregor Hunter. The advantage costing Ospreys here, but Hunter,
he missed one, got one, but on this occasion, it collapsed on the other
They've taken full advantage of the sin bining, because this the ten
minutes, Ospreys are down to 14 men. They've had two penalties and
they've got themselves back ahead. Very much Gregor Hunter taking
advantage there of the extra man he had. He had three penalties, he got
two of them, and there's Williams, keeping warm in the dug out for the
last ten minutes. How can they respond Edinburgh, edging in the
lead by a single point. Still very much to play for here in
skipper, Sean Cox. Played a lot of rugby in the second row this it
from the counter. Interesting Tonks finding Fussell at full back for
Ospreys, and always looking to do that little bit extra, Fussell, but
dislodgeed the ball there, it was a good tackle there by Fife. Fife who
is starting to have more influence there, he grey angled earlier in
the second half. His first league at the start of the season, he came
off the bench in three of the past with both captains, if not both
doubt, if the scrums keep collapsing, more yellow cards will
be issued, we've seen one, and there will abnew face in the next
scrum, because Jones is coming on, than going down. Grant looking to
see if there's a chance, just to go in a little trundle, and Nel
had, covered well with Tonks, lovely inside ball to Parker.
McInally, man and ball, well timed tackle but offside. Advantage being
the end   it fact another penalty, off side decision Well, Lewis, this
was the tat, he gave the ball the turnover, it was a weak kick
interest Morgan, didn't change the lines, that was meat to the
opposite team, and big tackle that came on, Stuart McInally but Lewis
was a judge to be from an offside position, the time Visser got the
ball, it fizzleed out and no advantage played and referee,
brought play back in. Again, another important kick for Gregor
Hunter. Edinburgh, chipping away, and every three points added gets
them closer to safety. That is three more, the third second half
penalty for Gregor Hunter. The Ospreys have to chase the game
in the final quarter. Couple of score updates, been
following the dragons, 14 3, they lead, Leinster lead, and it is a
result, Leinster hanging on, 16 15, Dunn condones and you are on now.
It's going to come down to the last 20 minutes, you need the
experienced players on the field, these players have been in the
situation before, and they know, at the moment, there's ill discipline,
which is costing us points. What about the fact you have the two big
boys, is that premeditate or tactic thinking? I think it is as a game,
of the score line, dictates substitutions, and they want the
experience on the field, because it looks like it will be a tight 20
minutes. Great banter, there's brilliant banter between Rick
O'Shea and Jed T, great fun. Thanks, interesting to see that you
haven't got too far away from the pie van either, that's experience
coming into play as well. Dear me. Walker, and then didn't play the
whistle and giving possession back to John Yapp. This nice inside ball
to Parker, good interplay, and getting the ball away from the
tackle. Good hands from Stuart McInally. No doubting who are the
ones dictateing the game in the second half. There could be space
outlet. Lovely kick but wouldn't sit up for Tom Brown. That was
enterprising play from Edinburgh on the one side and almost got a try
on the other. Interesting again, position of Richard Fussell to put
the pressure on Tom Brown, look at Fussell, clearing down the space,
Butchs his man, but always down this near side, wasn't it great
hands by Edinburgh. On the wide out, just the interlinking play, and
hasn't Parker handled the ball well in the last ten minutes. Richie
Rees knew where the space was, and here is where it ended, but Fussell
put his man under pressure. Good play by the Ospreys full back.
kept the Ospreys within the score. But they have to shor up the scrum
now, just a couple of metre away, a couple of metres from their try
line. Sincere interesting, because the experienced head of Jones has
come on, and for me, Nel has popped up in the last two skrums, Williams
has not reacted with you the more experienced man, is certainly
making his mark on the scrum. Watch again, can Nel stay down, because
if he doesn't and his head pops T should be a penalty for the Ospreys.
57 caps for Wales, Duncan Jones, last of them three years ago. Up it
goes again and that's exactly what haste haste haste db Scott Hastings
from the loose end, with you missed touch by the Ospreys, they can't
afford that, because they're under pressure. They still are, Visser
gets space. Held on after the tackle. Good work by Fife. He is
getting congratulations from his team mates. Here's the kick from
Visser. Excellently recovered by Webb. Rhys Webb goes back down here.
I felt Walker, if he booted the ball down the pitch, that would
relieved all the pressure, and as a result he's taken the ball into
contact and given Edinburgh another opportunity. Just a lack of
experience from Walker, where he had an opportunity to clear his
lines, and as a result he's put his team under pressure. Here we see it
again, Eli Walker, he clears the space, Edinburgh has had so much
pressure in the last ten minutes sore so. Fife has given Hunter this
opportunity, that's a super kick, the best of the evening, by Gregor
Hunter and now the gap is widening. Ospreys need to convert the try, to
get back on level terms. He's kicked well, five penalty from
Hunter hundred. He kicked it. He is kicking Edinburgh into a winning
performance now. Ross Jones comes on to the right wing.
Isaacs departs. Ospreys have to do something in the final 16 minutes.
Second half penalty, look at that, incredible. That's rethrect the in
the way that slowly but surely, Edinburgh, through the boot of
Hunter have turned a 17 8 deficit they have the space and time if
Hunter's kicked the charge down and the way is clear. If it bounces,
the slip helps. Oh he does his best to get there, but he is so close,
just short. Skipper, Bearman, Grant comes out of the traps in a tackle.
Now the defence reformed. And the penalty goes against the Ospreys,
and that little bit of luck, didn't go their way. Well the charge down
here, Matthew Morgan hit a real opportunity, did he, the shape of
the rugby ball, but the defence of Edinburgh scramble well. Look how
many men they got back then, and then the defence, King floping down
on his man, and the referee, he didn't have alternative, he had to
give the penalty and Ospreys, well that was almost a lifeline hand
today them. Hunter with a charge down kick, almost gave an
opportunity to Matthew Morgan. Edinburgh can thank Parker, because
he grabbed Morgan back by his short aren't enough. Greig Tonks,
scrambles away, Morgan is there. Lewis.
The Ospreys have to strike quickly. Matthew Morgan, a wit of confusion,
and picked up by Yapp, now they have to get back quickly. Edinburgh,
the crowd urging them to look for the wide open spaces Very important
tackle by King. And it could be a good offload, King got the tackle.
Well there was a warning in here, wasn't there. Well I was going to
say, the game was very much in the balance. It was whoever was going
to make the next mistake, and unfortunately for the Ospreys, it
is a big mistake, because that's ten minutes in the sin bin for Sam
Lewis. The two yellow cards in this game, the first one on Williams,
cost Ospreys almost the match. Edinburgh's turn to bring on fresh
legs, for the remaining dozen minutes, Yapp departs, and Jacobsen
Edinburgh. They weathered that Mini of the anomalies in the game that
the person whose four players behind can hold the ball and not
get anybody near him, but it is in the rules and difficult to defend
against. Robert McAlpine. Hunter nobody out
wide for Edinburgh on the left  defending in their own 22 again,
where they spent so much time in of his hands, McAlpine it was.
Ospreys being stretched with the man down in Sam Lewis in the sin
bin that robed McAlpine, who is on for Parker, showing inexperience
there, in the heat of a game, no the protecting the ball in the
tackle. Now then, let's see where Phil is hiding. There's reserve
seats, Tom, that Morgan effort, would he be better picking it up?
Yeah, if he had more time, he had more than he thought, and
fortunately that was a great opportunity for Ospreys to get back
in the game. A little bit of inexperience there, on Edinburgh's
22, putting the ball away, and Ospreys now have to score twice in
ten minute, and at the moment they don't look like they can. Edinburgh
keeping the territory. They kick goals well, Ospreys have been
isolated a few times, and Edinburgh has been good on the ball. Ready
for the Mexican wave. Thanks. Amongst the crowd of 3,128, but
unfortunately in a 67,000 seater stadium. Great scrum from Ospreys,
again the experience coming in there with the Jones. There he is.
Putting Willem Nel under pressure, he is getting the head underneath
There's ten minutes on the clock, another try and conversion could
get them on to level terms. So very much in the balance. But they need
the territory, they've been under last scrum collapse. He's OK. Of
course, there has been a few skrums gone down, and we've seen Ford with
a nasty injury. If it is not set, it is a factor of the game isn't
in the last few minutes again. Had the Ospreys had Morgan, just gone
in earlier, it could have really set the cat amongst the pigeons for
the last few minutes, as it is Ospreys a man short, back fighting
enough for scrum half to do anything creative with it. Sean Cox
defence goes up and across. The blind passing the hands from Izak
van der Westhuizen, nice prop up from the paw. There's a chase and
kick for nothing, because it pins the Ospreys back in the 22. There's
territory coming in for Richie Rees. When a team is attacking, they're
building up the phases of possession well. Stretch the
defence, keep the ball in hand. Richie Rees, may be thinking now,
if he pins the Ospreys back in their own 22, then he can wrap up
the game. Look at the second half territories, that's with a he is
by Bishop, but not held, he is away and still going Tonks. Now the
alarm bells are ringing for the Ospreys, with the loose pass, gone
straight back in Edinburgh hands. Spilt! It's got to be forward, but
offside, midfield anyway, no try for Fife but penalty for Edinburgh.
They did everything but score! was the early break here. And Tonks
decided to go, well, it is a difficult one, because the tackling
man has to release the ball, and it was a bit unfortunate for the
Ospreys, but good continuity here from Edinburgh. But surely they
butchered the chance out wide. It was an offside given, whilst Tom
Brown got the ball, he didn't find his man, and Visser spilt the ball
as Fife thought he'd gone in the corner. Off side there, you can see
the hand from Williams. Butchered chance, opportunity to score and
all for Gregor Hunter. This could take the losing bonus point away
from the Ospreys, slides on the wrong side of the posts. So for the
moment the Ospreys still have something, to show for their long
journey north. Still with an opportunity to draw
the game, if Morgan could have a penalty. He convert five of them.
Balances off Matthew Morgan, cleaned up by Andrew Bishop. Sam
Lewis waiting to cam back on for the Ospreys. But they've lost the
ball. Back under pressure again the Ospreys, Fife. Webb has done an
awful lot of covering, he knew he was on his own to create space for
Rabo direct Man of the Match. Osprey side, full back, I've been
impressed with Richard Fussell. For me, the man is the captain for
Edinburgh, it is Sean Cox, a lot of hard grafting work done by the
try scorer, one try a piece. There's Cox carrying again, and
leading the team forward, as he has done so many times this evening.
Improviseation from Rees, to Grant, back in the pocket is Hunter. Goes
for the left footed drop goal, just charge, touched in flight. So
that's interesting. Because it was touchdown there, it is a scrum five,
so fortuitous for Edinburgh, can they deny the Ospreys a bonus point.
This will be the third win for Edinburgh in the season. A much 
needed win for Michael Bradley's team. Very unlucky for Jones, he
didn't know the bauch wasn't touched. He will have a 22 metre
restart, but for now, one final chance for Edinburgh, to take
everything away from the Ospreys. They will do, because it is the
Osprey scrum that has been penalised. Jones penalised and
Edinburgh should go for gold. It is exactly what Cox has done, good
thinking from the Edinburgh captain. Well, he made a decisive decision
then, and his captaincy and the way he led this team, he is being
decisive, his tackling has been excellent, he's led his team. But
there you can see, Duncan has come in, but it was all about him coming
in at an angle and on that occasion, the penalty went against him. It is
the woot of Gregor Hunter that's been the telling factor in the
second half. With a final kick of the match. Gregor Hunter makes it a
real tough journey for the Ospreys, because that kick takes away the
losing bonus point, Edinburgh's first win since September. Ends a
winning run of five for the Ospreys, and it is huge disappointment for
the champions, and great relief and joy for he had wru. They had the
best of the second half by a long, long way, just one try a piece,
both in the first half. Nothing at all for the Ospreys in the second
half. And as it turns out, rather cruelly at the end, nothing to show
for all their efforts. Because it is finished, at Edinburgh,
is finished, at Edinburgh, After a tight opening hour, it
sprang into life. Home side pu then visitors struck back by Matthew
Morgan, who dubbed down a three minutes later. Ospreys were undone
minutes later. Ospreys were undone by indiscipline. Two yellow cards
costing them dearly, and that was punished about I Gregor Hunter who
We Tom, it was a very disappointing day, we spoke at the start of the
programme about the Ospreys coming here, as favourite with the
experience they had on the bench and looking into the playoff zone,
but the second half they came off second best is this They did, you
have to see the players reaction, it shows what it meant to them,
they haven't won a game since September and some of the faces
were brilliant. They kept the ball well. I thought the contact area,
were really good for fighting for the ball, the Ospreys never really
got into the second half. They couldn't get themselves out of the
own half and kicked their goals well. I thought Gregor Hunter was
outstanding. We can go with steel steel steel. Congratulations, it
was second half performance that did it, what did you say at half
time? It is not just me, the coach got us together and we knew we had
to tie newspaper a few areas. We gave cheap penalties away and
dropping off tackles, I got brushed off, maybe that's game rostiness,
Ospreys have been in the LV cup, so we start in the second half what we
could do. It was a badly needed win, how much confidence will that give
you? We need today pick up, we were coming off the back of five defeats,
plus a Heineken game, we knew how important it was, we have a tricky
away game in Connaught, we should have a good mix next week, and we
want to build on this one. You have RaboDirect Pro 12 match of the
match. It was mentioned the inefficiency, but Ospreys have a
lot to blame for needless mistakes and the yellow cards It was
disheartening, after the first half, this is suicide really, lost a
player to a yellow card and then the game just changes, it is
mistake ridden, the likes of Walker, Rhys Webb who played well, making
silly mistakes, it is not just making them, but not reacting to
them n fairness to the Edinburgh side, they basically made the most
of them. Two yellow cards, that doesn't help when you're down to 14
men, for 60 minute, it will are hard work. Ospreys, in the second
half, were nowhere near the side of finishing the first half, that's
the most disheartening thing. How much of a sick ner was the
scrum, that cost you the losing bonus? The scrum went OK, but it
was the referee's opinion, I thought the last one was one of our
better ones, but obviously it is sickening, we lost a point there,
and a lot of mistakes there, that shouldn't have been happening.
Yellow cards, how will that effect? Yellow cards were key, 14 man for
ten minutes, is hard enough, but then another ten, it adds up, boys
are tired. We didn't play on areas we should have, the efficient was
there, but performance was poor. Matthew Morgan lovely try, we
unlucky at the end of the game when the ball evaded him. How much of a
difference two that have made? Obviously a massive difference, he
is a big talent coming through. And some nights they go for you,
tonight, you would have put your money on T wouldn't make the line
tonight. We go back, week's training, pick our heads up, and go
fighting for next week, really. Thanks for that. Let's have a look
at the table. Ospreys were on a five game winning streak, and they
were hoping victory would propell Zone. Well, Rob, there was a
chancetor Ospreys to draw level, Edinburgh won, but they were seven
points down, and Matthew Morgan had the chance to score, should he have
done better, and was the penalty harsh? Could he have picked it up,
that's the question, he almost got to the line, and the great
defensive work, they got numbers back there, is this a penalty, ball
comes out, obviously, the advantage, with the Ospreys, there's another
phase, Bearman goes in, he's driven back, and then it is a case of
resetting it, slow ball, you want to drive in. You're talking about
two players there, who are not even tackled. There's a support player,
they both go to deck, that's not a penalty, no way on earth. It is not
a penalty Very poor decision,'s driving forward, both go down, and
they're not a penalty, it's a referee's angle of how he sees that.
That ball. But, no, when Matthew Morgan is looking at that ball,
you're praying it is going to pounce up in your hand, and
unfortunately it bounced awkwardly, it is a shame, because there's a
massive dead ball area. It could have been a try. Now we have the
backs coach. Second half, you lost it, what was the difference did you
it, what was the difference did you feel? First half We were pleased
how we controlled the game, second half was a flip side and you could
point the finger at one or two individual moment that affected the
flow of the game, we lost our exposure. Annoyed with the lack of
discipline for the two yellows? Yeah, we didn't do favours to the
rev, it was general, bit of ill discipline there, across the whole
board, not just in the contact area, general application in the game.
Ill luck for Matthew, you could have snuck it at the end? We might,
but we got what we deserved. Finally the scrum that you conceded
the losing bonus point on, how did you see that? Again, we've got
frustrations around that area of the game, that's a constant really,
and now we just want to attack the scrum and make a difference. You
can put full off the wrong side of it. We haven't got a great deal of
time left. Let go to tomorrow, we spoke this depth about the two
teams, Tom, Colin and Steve said when teams face New Zealand they
find an extra gear, they play better, was that the ways when you
played? Yeah you do. You're desperately trying to beat these
guys, because we haven't done it in such a long time. For Wales, if
they want to do well, they have to do something different, they could
be naive in attack, thinking the same game plan would work, but you
got to try something different, whether having the crack from the
them, the IRB rankings are at stake. Wales have dropped to eighth, if
they fall out of the top eighth, you could end up in a World Cup
you could end up in a World Cup pool, to end up, to come out. Every
day matters, it is vital, World Cups are so important these days,
Wales need to be there, so they have to put in the prefrplgs and
get what they can out of the two games. What do they need to do,
deadly they are in attack, what does Wales have to do? Based on the
last two performances, variety, we need to play a different type of
game and make the All Blacks think. At the moment, size again, they're
reading us too easily, putting defenders where attackers are
hopefully tomorrow, based on the no expectation matter, we'll div out
there, and produce performance. briefly, nobody has given them a
chance, can they do it is this Possibly they can. It is not   you
wouldn't put your house on t I know this team, they can play fantastic
tomorrow, it is Wales versus the All Blacks, so much riding on this
game, no one is giving Wales a chance. It is into the 24 hours,
until the blackness Des sends on Cardiff.
Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk to you again
Because a vision softly creeping Left deceit while ifg sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains Within The Sound of Silence
In restless dreams I walked alone Mirror of cobbled stone
Meet the halo of our street Turned my collar to the cold and
