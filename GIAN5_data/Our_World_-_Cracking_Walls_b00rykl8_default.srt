some of the most ground breaking cancelled, although nonfrom Gatwick.
Burma has been celebrating the annual Armed Forces day. The UN has
called on the authorities to release more than 2,000 political
prisoners. That a free and transparent vote
cannot currently be held. More of the stories online at
bbc.co.uk/news. The headlines coming up at the top
of the hour, now it is time for Our World, it looks at the impact that
the growth of the internet has had in Iraq.
Since the fall of Saddam Hussein, the internet has been used to
unfolding history in Iraq, through wars, images, sounds and video
clips, from suicide bomb moments to online bloggers, but new voices are
being heard in this virtual arena. I'm 24 hours online..A
generation, bringing western ideals into traditional cultures.
We have to speak out, express ourselves in international ways.
And they are finding new ways to spread messages.
Above all, a savvy youth is claiming this new terity as their
own. Now we are Facebook, Twitter,
Yahoo!, Hotmail. I travel from war torn Baghdad, to
the mountainous regions of Kurdistan and then on to the heart
of the Shia Najaf. To find out if the internet can crack through the
cultural and religious walls that sounds this fractured nation.
   that sounds this fractured nation.
   that sure ounds this fractured nation.
   sure ounds. In Saddam Hussein's Iraq, during the run up to the US 
led invasion in 2003 a lone voice spoke to the outside world from
inside of Baghdad. Salam Pax, whose web name manys
peace was an Iraqi blogger who broke through Saddam Hussein's
media black out and gave the world a rare insight into the life of
ordinary Iraqi people. Seven years on, Salam Pax has gone.
But there are many more Iraqi voices and the internet, helping to
make connections in this fractured country.
From the moment you enter Baghdad, this is the familiar scene. Many
neighbourhoods divided by high concrete walls, the city has been
surrounded by this wall. You are feeling you are entering a prison
as big as Baghdad. So, I'm wondering how the young people here
get in touch with the outside world? And how they crack the walls,
how they can communicate with the rest of Iraq? Behind the all too
familiar headlines coming out of Baghdad, the life continues and
ordinary people carry on. The very first minute that I wake
up, I will think about which safe reed to go to college and basically,
hmm, staying alive. AK is a 20 year old student
studying international relations in Baghdad. For his safety, we drove
him from his college and interviewed him in our car. The
route takes us through many roadblocks and checkpoint, but AK
has found that the internet allows him to crack these walls and
communicate across the barriers. Now we have Facebook, Twitter, we
have Yahoo!, Hotmail, Skype, I love Skype, by the way.
So we keep connected. Personally, I have like 200 friends on Facebook.
So, basically, it's a gift from God, actually.
During Saddam Hussein's regime, mobile phone Telecoms did not exist
in most of Iraq and the internet was limited mostly to government
officials. It is estimated that today up to
80% of the population have mobile phones, however, according to the
use, State Department only a% of homes have internet access. Not
surprising when it can cost a fifth of the average Iraqi's income to
get connected. AK is one of the luck you few, he
comes from a middle class family that can afford to connect to the
internet. Also, he is a man, which means he is free to leave his house,
but this is not the case for most women in Baghdad.
In one of Baghdad's middle class neighbourhoods, a young Iraqi girl
agreed to meet me. How are you? Fine, how are you?
Rafal is a 19 year old medical student. She showed me around her
home. In 2003, before we knew that the war is going to happen, we had
to tape those windows, just to minimise the loss of the windows
when the explosion happened. Actually it worked. It saved many
window! From her po outlook it is difficult to tell that she faces   
from her positive outlook it is difficult to realise that she faces
grave danger each day. Every day,    every day, I look at
my family and myself friends. I don't know when I'm going to die it
could be the last moment. Every time there is an explosion, people
die. When she's not in college, she is a
virtual prison ner her home. The internet and a mobile phone are her
only tools to stay in touch with the outside world.
I don't have this much free time. So I don't use the internet during
my exams, but when I'm free, I'm 24 hours online! Rafal uses Facebook
and e mail to keep in touch with her friends and takes her mind off
the danger and the instability outside by watching comedy clips on
YouTube. Silence! I kill you! Outside the
wealthier neighbourhoods, many Iraqi families cannot afford to buy
a computer or connect to the internet at home, but for $1 an
hour, anyone can use a rather slow connection at one of the growing
numbers of internet cafes in Baghdad.
Many people are coming here. All people, writers, actors who come to
the shop. We have young people browsing the internet or chatting.
We have families coming together to see other families in other
countries. Rebuilding the infrastructure,
which was destroyed in the war is an enormous task.
The Iraqi government has given this lucrative contract to private
companies and claims to have ambitious plans to develop the
technology. It is also trying to use the internet to improve its
relations with the public. A few months ago, the Prime Minister,
Nouri Al Maliki, launched his own YouTube channel.
And they have a backing of some major international figures.
It's great that the Iraqi government is introducing the
Iraqigov YouTube cham, so they will discover even more that is great
about Iraq. The new country being built, the resurgence of a new
society and the amazing things that However, progress has been slow,
due to the security situation, legal issues and alleged corruption
and nepotism. The internet also has a darker side.
It has been an important tool in the hands of Islamic extremist
groups in Baghdad. Websites like Snipers of Baghdad
have posted woos of roadside bottoms and sniper fire, which some
say have influenced many young people to join these groups.
But Iraq is much bigger than Baghdad alone.
In the mountainous north of the country, lies the self governed
Kurdish region. The next leg of my journey is to the area00 kilometres
north of Baghdad. Thousands of Kurdish families left Saddam
Hussein's oppression and went to the west. The region has been
stable and has managed to avoid ethnic violence. This has created
an opportunity for foreign investment.
In a reverse brain drain with many refugees coming back to Kurdistan.
I went to meet Sazan and her family, who have returned to Irbil after
seven years in Australia. Like Salam Pax, Sazan decided to
chronicle her new life in Kurdistan in a blog which resulted in her
thoughts being published in the Guardian newspaper in Britain.
But when I meet Sazan and her college friend, Sayran, it is
obviously that they are no different from many other western
students. We start texting in the morning,
what time are you going? I'm in uni, where are you? Yes, until we meet.
Normally we go out for lunch. Especially as there are no malls.
This life is very different from that of Rafal and AK, yet, the two
girls have a connection with their contemporaries in the capital.
I have a lot of friends in Baghdad, Basra, Hella. I went to Washington
to the US last summer. My Facebook is the only way that I can connect
with these people again. Now, they are all on my Facebook, we connect
with each other. I am so thankle, it is the only way to connect.
The girs are students at university and use the internet to connect to
the world. We had a video conference with the
University of Texas, so it was a God chance. They sit in the class,
we sit in our class, we hear one another, we debate. Linking two
different cultures, two different people, from different back grounds,
and we felt like we were in a room together.
Sazan's father was a Peshmerga fighter, he hopes that the internet
will bring a better future for his Butan grew up and was educated in
England, but has become the IT department for the Kurdish regional
Government. The Government is serious about
developing IT. Delivering modernisation is the main policy.
We believe that administrative reform within the government can be
really enabled by information technology. We believe that will
make government more efficient and it will make our government more
transparent and it will allow citizens to hold government
accountable and to gain the services that they really deserve.
The longer period of stability has meant that the infrastructure here
is more developed than in Baghdad. With optical fibre linking it to
neighbouring companies and mobile phone wireless internet replacing
the traditional internet cafes that used to be on every street corner.
In a word, investment and competition amongst Telecoms
companies and internet service providers in this lucrative
business has started to drive costs In the 21st century, many things
have crossed the borders. But there has been tension created
between the deeply religious and traditional society with the
Western values. This influx of Western Educated newcomers with
liberal views is causing some problems.
Ladies and gentlemen, exclusive right here
Yes, yes, Dashne.
Dashne is a pop star and TV presenter who first used the
internet to infiltrate Kurdish society from her adopted home in
Her provocative music have provoked many people. From YouTube, MySpace
and Facebook she has built up a big following among many people. Two
years ago, she went back to her homeland. Not everybody is familiar
with Kurdistan. We must speak out and express ourselves in an
international way. We can then get much better connected to the
outside world. That is my ambition. That is what I'm doing. For that I
must be close to the people so that I can get the reaction and do
better work. She is very popular, particularly with young men. Many
people in society think that the internet is contributing to the
destruction of the Society of Kurdistan. I showed some people at
the eclipse of Dashne.    some Many of the older generation hark
back to simpler times and criticise the sensation. But Dashne is
Many of the neighbouring Middle Eastern countries sense and
internet for political and religious reasons. There is heated
debate within the Iraqi government about whether or not to control
content. But the regional government in Kurdistan says it has
a different approach. We did not have any filters at the moment.
Government policy is that we will not employ any filters in the
future. We will be at choice to households and families. To the
individual, effectively. We think that filtering the internet, it is
the longer end internet. It is powerful because it is not filtered.
Because everybody can connect with how they wish and where they wish.
To filter it would take that power away. Outside of the city in the
remote mountains and villages, the rural life is well advanced. The
satellite dishes are everywhere and many people have internet capable
mobile telephones. We brought Dashne to this village, two hours
drive away. Amazingly, she was In Kurdistan the argument is about
Western influence over Kurdish culture. In Iraq, it is quite
different. The next part of my journey takes me to the opposite
end of the country. Both physically This place is 160 kilometres south
of Baghdad and is one of the holy cities in Shia Islam. This is a
pilgrimage. During Saddam Hussein's mostly Sunni regime, Shia was
marginalised. After the invasion of Iraq, people began to take
advantage of internet technology to spread their message throughout
Iraq and the rest of the world. Today, millions of hours   
millions of people from many countries connect with holy men
Bashir Al Sadr is a grand Ayatollah. His website offers advice and
services to follow was in many different languages. What is
interesting with this kind of meeting is the speeches that he has
given. He is taking to the computer and going on to the internet. This
is the way in which they are connecting with followers worldwide.
From these modest offices, this man has a significant influence on
political and social affairs. While I was here, I'm next doctors,
professors and several people On the other side of this area,
this is a young cleric that is attempting to communicate his
extreme views online. In 2004, a Shia army fought a religious war
against opposition troops. Some people believe that his goal was
were behind the killing of many Sunni Muslims in Baghdad. He is a
towering figure in Iraqi politics and he uses the internet as a
political tool. Abu Hassan is in charge of the public relations and
Travelling to this area was a direction in which each part of
Iraq is heavy. Although the internet is breaking down national
and political barriers, it appears that at the same time it is
creating new, religious and cultural borders. In the south it
is bringing together Shia Muslims worldwide and it is helping to
create a Shia centre which some people think is rivaling Makah. The
internet has become a tool for promoting western values and
connecting people from around the world. But Kurdish nationalism is
also a driving force and it could create yet another war. Beyond the
different motivations and purposes of internet use in Iraq, there is
not any doubt that the young people across the country it is providing
a unifying force that is changing perceptions. I think now for ask
for Kurdish people, the internet is good if it is used in a good way.
did not ask her if she was a Sunni or a Shia. It is very helpful. We
are not terrorists. We are friendly people. We can make friends easily
with people. It is a major part in my life. I have to respect them in
the same way that they respect everybody else. It is with respect
that you can build confidence. You build relationships. You build
friendships. And eventually you can Not a bad looking day today. There
will be different weather systems today. But if you are going outside
with the family, we will have some scattered showers, particularly in
the south eastern parts of England. But we will have dry and bright

British Isles. We will get some good spells in Wales and north east
parts of England and back to Northern Ireland. Showers in the
south and east tending to ease off. But some will remain. More cloud in
the north and west of Scotland. Quite a lot of wind. This is the
situation in the north west Highlands. Not bad in the south 
west of England as we finished today into tonight. This is the
picture in East Anglia and the south east. We have still got some
heavy rain here. Dry mostly on the south coast. We will get some
patchy cloud but otherwise it is looking quite pleasant.
Temperatures are 10 and 11 in Cornwall and Devon. Dry were they
in Wales. If you're out and about you should have a reasonable
looking into today. This is the picture in Northern Ireland with
some decent spells as we finish off. Showers will bubble up in the
south east. Then they will disappear and it will be quite

the south west. This is the picture in Scotland. In northern England
and Northern Ireland you have got a dry and better looking day.
Temperatures up to 10 and 12 degrees. Cold air is trying to
