  Welcome to To Buy Or Not To Buy.
  Today we're in Royal Windsor, seat of lineage and learning.
But forget about Eton. Today we'll be giving our own learning seat
in the form of a property masterclass.
Irwin! Pay attention. There will be questions later.
There's a lovely lady called Janet.
She has a son called Marcus. She would like Marcus to go to this school.
Janet lives here. The school catchment area is here.
If she would like Marcus to go to the school, where does this lovely lady need to live? Irwin? Irwin?
  Where?
  What's she?
Have you listened to a single word? Come here!
Home Counties housewife Janet has her hands full with son Marcus, daughter Zena and husband Liam.
Even bath time is a chore with pampering reserved for the canine colossus that is Caleb.
It's not the graft making this housewife desperate, rather the location of her family home.
With Marcus leaving middle school soon, Janet's thinking education,
and the catchment area of Windsor Boys.
to help Janet enjoy a smooth landing in a new home.
Morning, Janet. I want to get this sorted straight away.
You're married to Liam.
  Mm hm.
  Paula is not Liam. Where is Liam?
Earning money I'm going to spend!
Paula, you have flown in especially.
  All the way from Helsinki this morning!
  Did you spot any areas that seemed good?
Yeah!
Southern Spain sounds good!
  We're not looking for Spain.
  No.
  This is very specific.
I'd like a semi detached, three bedrooms with garage,
possibility of extending the box bedroom.
Even in your dream house a box bedroom!
  Why not stay here?
  The garden's not big enough.
  Right.
  And it's the wrong location for the kids' schools.
  Right.
  Schooling.
  How far is the radius of the catchment area for posh Windsor Boys?
  I don't know about posh!
  The catchment is Windsor.
  Right.
  The postcode...?
  Old Windsor, Windsor, West Windsor.
  The common word is Windsor.
  Windsor.
  Windsor.
  Does Liam have anything he wants to be close to?
  He'll go with the flow.
  He doesn't get any choice! Does he get a fair crack of the whip?
  He goes down the pub.
  All right. And he's happy.
  Yeah.
  And also, to be honest, what bloke likes to be dragged round houses?
  He hates it.
  We get paid to do it, otherwise we'd be crying.
  He didn't see this house.
  No.
  He didn't see it?
  He turned up the day we moved in.
  That's good.
  To help with the boxes?
  And then he got a flight to Ireland.
  Then I wrecked it and pulled the garage down.
  You said that.
  If we find you a property that needs work doing, is that OK?
  Yeah.
  Anything else?
  I'd like a 100 foot garden.
  What's the bare minimum that Caleb can deal with?
  He's like a Shetland pony.
  70 80 feet.
  He needs that, OK.
  In Windsor!
  South facing.
  Right, OK. Let's have a budget, then. How much have we got?
  Pounds or thousand pounds?
  Thousand.
  We're getting there.
Before we disappear and try to make some sense of this,
  is there anything else we need to know? Paula, help me. Will you wish us luck?
  You'll need it!
  Never needed it more than today!
  Thank you. Bye!
Right, Jonnie. She's a woman who knows exactly what she wants and also what her husband wants.
I'm in a little bit of fear here. She talks about wrecking houses, knocking garages down.
If she could knock a garage down, she could knock a TV presenter down.
Do you know what I'm going to do? If we don't achieve it today, I'm going to blame you.
The Royal Borough of Windsor lies 20 miles west of London and has the oldest occupied castle in the world,
  boasting over 1,000 years of history.
  When dear old Liz   or the Queen to you commoners  
has had too much of the Big Smoke, this is her official residence.
And if she fancies company, there's rich and famous a plenty around here for a cuppa or to walk the Corgis.
Be it her Commonwealth chum Natalie Imbruglia who lives here...
Or pop royalty Sir Elton John, who could step in if Her Majesty is double booked.
These royal connections cost, though. The average price is 30% above the national average.
So how far would the £350,000 budget stretch in other regal locations across the UK?
Well, there's this finely formed three bedroom townhouse in Leamington Spa.
With a private courtyard, it's not a king's ransom at 320 grand.
If you're more Prince of Tides than palace bound pomp,
step aboard this stunning 49 foot houseboat moored in Chelsea.
Riverside living in the heart of the city could be yours for 350 grand.
Or for understated elegance, how about this three bedroom semi in Tunbridge Wells?
It's even got an original working well in the cellar.
And it could be yours for £350,000.
Time for me to do some homework. How educated are the people of Windsor?
I have a couple looking for a property in prime location for Windsor Boys school.
  Is this a popular request?
  Yes.
  Are you related?
  Yes.
  I'm her mum.
  Oh, right, this is perfect.
  Let's get the school report first hand. What were the school reports like?
  They were average.
I wouldn't say she was brainy.
Three bedrooms, back garden space to walk a dog and they want to be in the catchment area. £350,000.
Is that a good amount of money for that?
6, 7 months ago, it would have been a good amount, but the way the market has moved on in six months,
  it's now £350,000 £400,000.
  Really?
What's your favourite fact about Windsor? Is there anything I can say, "You didn't know this"?
  It's well connected. Queen Victoria made it have two railway stations.
  Did she?
  Yes.
Do people educated in Windsor Boys school stand out?
  Of course.
  Are you Windsor Boys school?
  I am.
  Really?
  I am. And I'm an estate agent.
  I had a size 10 slipper across my butt more times than I can remember.
  Not out of choice?
  No. Mandatory.
You sent me on a fact finding mission. Windsor has a famous resident, one of your favourites.
Actually, two of my favourites. Elton John and David Furnish.
Elton and David, if you're watching, you might get a very interesting neighbour. How did you get on?
Well, he might move alongside Janet to her new neighbourhood. Property Number One.
It's within the catchment area. But also she likes to knock things down.
  This has no garage to knock down!
  You couldn't find a garage! My property is beautiful.
It is in Old Windsor. Very nice everything.
  There is no reason they shouldn't live here.
  There is one reason   the wild card reason.
It's big, it's beautiful, on the cusp of the catchment area, but what's not to like?
  OK, where shall we start?
  Logically, Property Number One.
  Jonnie's one.
'Welcome to my choice in the heart of Old Windsor.
'It's pretty, it's got a massive garden, three bedrooms...
'One of which is tiny, and the loo's downstairs.
'You may mock, but this has everything they want.'
So here we are in Old Windsor.
You did mention that you fancied perhaps moving to Dedworth.
Our mystery property team spoke to estate agents in Dedworth.
  The name Janet rang many bells. You're well known.
  That's nice!
You know the market pretty well. Will that make you easy to please or hard to please?
  Hard.
  Brilliant(!)
  With a smile!
  Does your son own a bicycle?
  Yes.
Good, because it's a 15 minute bike ride to the school.
So he's living the rural dream in Old Windsor. He's like Elton. He travels everywhere on a bike.
  He's got a tandem.
  There you go.
  Famed in the area, literally. ..None of that's true.
  So what do you think, Janet?
  First impression, it looks small.
  Second, I don't like the wood.
  Second already!
  And I don't like the windows.
Is it true when you're property hunting, if you don't like the outside, you won't go in?
  Whereas you will go in?
  Yeah.
  Good job you're here!
  You can change the outside.
Why don't you become this voice of reason? Grab Janet, kicking and screaming, into the house.
  Ready? Go!
  Come on, Janet.
You all right? Is he all right?
Listen, I've got to do this later on. Good luck!
This is nice and cosy. It's nice and bright in here.
  That's a positive voice I can hear.
  It is, but it's Paula's voice. And Paula isn't buying the house.
It's a bit unusual, dining table at that end, seat at that end.
  Move the table.
  Not a big job.
  Nice space.
  Oh, it's a galley kitchen.
  It's quite wide for a galley.
  Plenty of space. You and I could sit there.
  Have a couple of wines!
There's enough space for us.
  Back door.
  Is it?
  Yeah. And now we're going to end up... in the shower.
  That'll be good! I like this one.
  A downstairs bathroom?
  Yeah.
Janet's thinking, "We've got a downstairs and upstairs bathroom."
So this isn't a hammer blow because she hasn't seen the details.
It's good to have that because their dog's gigantic, but...
  Has it got an upstairs bathroom?
  Half.
  It's got a toilet.
It's quite narrow.
Oh, look. Looks like the dogs.
  An old window. Oh, it IS narrow.
  It IS narrow, innit? Really narrow.
OK, this is the box room. It's a real squeeze.
  But they've got two lots of cupboards.
  Yeah.
It is, essentially, a box room. Two bedrooms and a box.
  It's your favourite colour   mauve.
  Yes.
  Nicely decorated again.
  Is that a cupboard?
  It's like an airing cupboard.
Oh, there's the extension. The kitchen and bathroom. They might have had the bathroom here and moved.
Huge ground floor extension. You could have a first floor one.
The only thing to look out for is the depth of the footing to make sure it can support it.
  This is the first thing to make sense.
  This one's a better size, with a couple of wardrobes for junk.
  Fitted cupboards.
  You can see the pub!
  Last orders!
  Hello, Liam!
  Yeah. He'll be happy, won't he?
Oh, look, a little room. No, definitely a no no   a toilet in the bedroom.
If that had a shower in it, it would be an ensuite.
But Janet doesn't like it.
It's bright and cheerful. A nice, bright, cheerful house, but it definitely ain't for me.
It's got three bedrooms, 120 foot garden, completely refurbished.
  I'll go and find out where I went wrong.
  It's in the catchment area!
  Where did I go wrong?
  The kitchen is very nice, don't like the bathroom downstairs.
  I would if I had one upstairs.
  Yeah, that's fair enough.
  Bedrooms are too small.
  You've got room to extend it. This is a 120 foot garden.
Your neighbours have two storey extensions. You could have a bathroom over the kitchen.
South east facing. A balcony over the park.
  Fancy it?
  No.
  Sorry.
  You're not going to be fooled.
  An honest answer.
  Shall we play Guess The Price?
  Yes.
  Maximum budget is £350,000. Janet, what is this on the market for?
  Straight in.
Right, Paula?
  I would think it's lower than that.
  Go on.
  Three two...
  No whispering!
299,950 versus 325.
OK, well, we've got a winner.
  It's Paula.
  Really?
It's on the market for £309,950.
So as it's 15 grand less than you thought, initially,
  does it change your view of the house?
  No.
No. Why would it? Why would it?
  There's two more houses to go. Are you confident?
  I am.
  Good, cos we're not.
  I'm not.
We're going to go to property two, my choice. It's this way. Come on.
Sit up straight and take notes because property number two is the teacher's pet.
Like Jonnie's, it's a semi. It's got a great garden,
but my top trump is three decent sized bedrooms and an attic ripe for conversion.
Paula and Janet, walk towards property two. It's a nice, solid, period property here.
I would say a little bit bigger than Jonnie's one.
We're a little bit nearer to the school that Marcus wants to go to.
  Janet, do you like the outside of this house?
  Yes.
  You do?
  Oh, good.
  Paula, do you like it?
  I'm surprised she likes that.
  Why?
  Because there's no front door there.
  Recently, they put the front doors on the side, which means you get a decent sized front room.
  If you saw this on the internet, would you go in, Janet?
  Yes.
  For the first time today, go into the house that you want to go into.
  Good luck.
  The right person said nice things about that.
  It was the power of that.
  Even I had my fingers crossed.
Did you at home? They did as well.
  Cosy. Nice, open space. It's a bit bigger than your front room.
  Don't you think it's a bit cottagey?
  We've turned a corner with Janet.
  Less of the "we", more of the "me".
  Nice sash windows.
  Oh, I like the fireplace.
  This is the dining room. Oh, look, it's got another fire.
  I like this.
  Everything's like wooden floors, wooden furniture.
  It's quite light as well.
  It's a country kitchen. I like this.
  Lovely, big windows here again.
That kitchen is the selling factor of this house.
  Shall we go in this one?
  Yeah, we'll go in here.
  Plenty of space. I don't know if it's the main room.
  I reckon the other room's the same.
Oh, it's got a door.
  A secret door.
  Secret door.
  Now, I definitely don't like that.
  What's in there?
  The gas boiler.
  Could they jam it up in the loft?
  Yeah.
  If that's the issue, she could put it in the loft.
  Oh, this is cosy. It's green.
  The green room. Your daughter likes green.
  Yeah, she loves green.
  It could be her room.
  It's a decent size. You've got a double bed.
And you've got wardrobes and a chest of drawers.
  You could get a desk in there.
  You could squeeze a smaller desk. It's quite light.
  Right, OK...
  Look, there's a loft. I hope they've got a ladder.
  We'll have to ask them.
A good thing to look out for in an area is how many people have done extensions.
They've gone out the back. Over the road, they've done loft extensions.
  People like the area and don't want to move.
  They're desperate to stay.
  This is quite a good size.
  It's a yellow room.
  This is good.
  Yeah, it's nice. Shall we look out the window?
  Is that a real single bed or is it a smaller one?
I don't know. Without getting a tape measure...
They don't need a tape measure. The viewers will know what I'm going to do. Jonnie, what am I going to do?
  That's what I'm going to do.
  That's the size of the bed, isn't it, Ed?
You're your own tape measure. If in doubt, flap 'em out and there I am, I'm a double bed.
That's a funny shaped bath, but it fits. Probably not my design, but it's good, it's clean.
  The house is in good nick. It still has the opportunity to extend not only outwards, but upwards.
  Yes.
  Does Janet like it?
  I'm not sure.
  Janet and Paula, inside that house... You liked it more than you thought you would.
  I did.
  I think you, Janet, kind of liked it.
  You're telling them they liked it. That's very good.
After what we faced earlier on, we need to be direct.
  You liked this a bit more than Jonnie's.
  Definitely.
  Is this enough for Caleb the dog?
  Yeah, it's a nice garden.
  Got a shed there as well.
  You've had much better reactions in this house.
  Yeah, it felt bigger and it had a proper housey feel.
Earlier on, you were talking about knocking things down or building things.
Here, upstairs, the neighbours have done a dormer kind of conversion.
  Yeah, a loft.
  Do you like that...?
  I'm not going for the answer...
  She could do.
  It comes down to price. Who's in the lead just now?
  Me.
  Paula?
  Yeah.
  You've got to beat her. Do you want to go first?
  No.
OK, fair enough. Paula?
I would go 340.
  340 grand.
I'm actually thinking it's at my budget, probably 3...
  ..49,950. I had to think about my budget.
  349,950, Ed.
Good news for you, Janet. You are the closest.
  See?
  Just focus on that victory at the moment
because the bad news is it's on the market at 399,950.
  But...
  Run, Ed!
  It's been on the market for a while
and they are in the zone for a negotiation.
It wouldn't be your budget, but somewhere in between the two,
  so if you loved it and with all the potential...
  Mm hm.
What Ed has done there is he's kept talking and talking and talking to stop you...
  I didn't ask Janet for an answer.
  What do you think about it being a shade under £400,000?
  I'm not surprised. It is nice.
  Can we do better than "nice"?
  We can do "wonderful". Ready for the wild card?
  I am.
  It's our favourite part of the programme.
Let's go. It's this way. Lead!
Welcome to the behemoth that is today's wild card.
  Janet wanted one house. We're giving her two.
  She wanted three bedrooms. We're giving her four.
  She wanted Windsor. We're giving her Eton Wick.
  We're hoping this cheeky choice doesn't get on HER wick!
Janet and Paula, the excitement must be spilling over as we are at the wild card. Look at it!
  It's gorgeous.
  It's gorgeous?
  It's lovely.
  And lovely.
We're in Eton Wick in a more modern property, but with more space.
  Compare this to properties one and two.
  A lot better.
  Good.
  And if you don't like it from the outside, you won't go in.
  Generally.
Now, we're about, as the crow flies, a mile and a half from the school.
So we're on the edge of the catchment area.
  Paula, is this kind of up your street?
  I'm excited.
  This is really good. Loads of space.
  And we've not forgotten about Liam.
  There's a pub at the end of the road.
  That's handy.
  Fantastic.
  Are you excited?
  Yes.
  It is the wild card. Ladies, give it your best. Three, two, one, enjoy.
  Thank you.
  Well, it was the best yet.
  It is the best yet. She's not gone in yet, though.
  No. It could all change...
  I'm doing it again.
  I'm joining you.
Oh, yeah, it's a nice, spacey hall.
They're digging the hall. It is the most welcoming, inviting "hall", aside from myself.
  Reception room.
  Nice size.
  You don't need to do anything to this.
My furniture would fit in there.
Into the kitchen...
  This is good.
  Yeah, it's quite nice.
Where does that door lead to?
  Here lies the secret weapon.
  Oh!
A little cloakroom area here.
  Another kitchen. It's a granny annexe.
  That's what it is.
  The daughter Zena...
  She's 16.
  Wants her own space. There it is.
It's got two rooms. It's like another flat.
You could rent that annexe out and have some money on the side.
So, we're coming this way.
  This is built over the extension.
  This must have four bedrooms.
  That's nice.
  Nicely decorated. You wouldn't have to decorate. You'd be happy.
  Wow!
  Yeah, go in there.
  I don't like bathrooms. I wouldn't have this bedroom, but that's fine.
When I was in that bathroom, I thought she would love that.
  It's modern.
  I love that.
  It's perfect, it's lovely.
You like it, I like it. Does Janet like it? No.
Bathroom... I love a bathroom.
  This is nice. This would be my room.
  It's got a bath. I like baths.
  Oh!
  I like that feature wall.
  It's beautiful.
  It's a nice size again.
  You'd get a double bed in here.
  Oh, this is nice.
  Plenty of cupboard space, come on.
  This is my room.
Oh, this is a nice boxroom.
  This is really good. This is the best one of the lot. What do you reckon?
  It's very nice, yeah.
  What are you thinking?
  It's lovely.
  What are you thinking?
  It's lovely.
I actually can't believe it. I...
As far as slow burners go, this is pretty much a slow, slow burner,
but we're there, aren't we? He's speechless! Ed?
  Be honest. You like this more than you thought you would on the outside?
  Yes, I do like this house.
  It's just the location.
  That's why it's the wild card cos we're a bit further out.
  For that, you get this and the granny annexe. Is it too much of a compromise?
  No, no.
It's very nice. It's better than nice. It's a great house.
  Good.
  Guess the price. How much is this on the market for?
  Paula?
  Just another 5,000.
  Just nipped it for you. You're the winner.
  Wow, again!
You've won "guess the price". There is no trophy, so you've just got the pride and memories of playing.
  Fantastic.
  What memories we've got!
The actual price of this house is the same as Ed's   399,950.
There's been a nibble, a nod, a whisper and a tickle
  and somewhere between your budget and this is kind of what you're aiming for.
You've seen all three properties.
  You must make the biggest decision of your lives about which one to test drive. Are you up to that?
  Yes.
  Ladies, head off that way and we'll see you later.
  Thank you.
  I'm interested to see how they make that decision.
  Darts in a board!
Maybe. But here's a reminder for you guys at home of the chaos that was today's three house tours.
If Janet is up for extension potential, she may choose property one.
With a bit of graft and cash, this option could still come in on budget
and be the future for the Foleys at £309,950.
More likely, though, is that they'll take up residence in my choice, property two.
With all the space they want, surely it's all over bar the bartering
on that asking price of 399,950.
Or will the wide open spaces of the wild card prove just too much to resist?
It's out of budget, it's out of Windsor, but the annexe could mean
it's in with a chance at 399,950.
Who'd have thought it? Janet's only gone and chosen the wild card.
It's alluring, Jonnie. I wouldn't mind giving it a run around myself.
Paula's had enough already. Where is she off to?
  No idea, but Janet is getting her first visitor.
  I hope her husband knows she's got a man around.
Fortunately, he's here in a purely professional capacity.
He's here to give the cost of making the granny flat all self contained.
  How much would it cost me...
  To block up the door, we're looking at somewhere between £300 and £600.
If you're thinking of renting out your annexe, you need to talk cold, hard cash.
Rental wise, probably 650 a month.
With the test drive pulling up to the finish line, who should put in an appearance but best pal Paula?
  She's not alone. Canine colossus Caleb is by her side.
  Did she ride him here like a miniature pony?
I don't know, but he looks right at home here. I wonder if Janet will be joining him?
  You've test driven the wild card. Who would have thought it?
  You've had your dog here. Massive dog.
  Massive garden.
  Yeah, he liked it.
  You've had a lot of people giving you advice. Was it of any use?
I was surprised about how much money you'd get from a granny flat.
We don't just throw this together. You've learnt something from this. Janet, here it comes.
  To buy or not to buy? That is the question.
  Maybe to buy.
  Maybe to...maybe to buy?
  If you had to weigh it from 100%, I'd say 70% to buy.
  70% gets you nearly an "A" grade these days.
  Gets you a distinction.
After property one and property two,
  if you were going to get a "maybe to buy", you'd have taken it.
  I'm happy with it. If you do buy the house,
  let us know.
  You can come and party with us.
  We'll disappear off into the sunset. See you later.
  Bye.
  Bye.
As the sun sets on one of the most chaotic property searches I've ever seen, I'm feeling fairly buoyed.
From the jaws of almost certain defeat earlier on, we've managed to clutch what I'll call a victory.
  She may not buy the house, but she's happier.
  It's been a journey and, hopefully, an inspirational one.
If anybody would like us to help them find a house, get in touch.
  Ta ta.
