slightly later time at 8:30pm. Good to? First, we are one week into a
feast of TV entertainment for the football fan, but can those review
not interested in the beautiful game avoid the World Cup? Soccer
players on safari. England's Three Lions looking for, well, even A1
lion would have done. Some WAGs it went to South Africa to help
deprived children. We are going over to Ben who is to
stay outside the city. So, does all of that have an
appropriate place on news bulletins? Not according to Mandy
Another viewer who contacted us with his concerns was John Graham.
Here is his report. This will not make me popular, so it before I go
further, can I make it clear I do not hate football, just like I
don't hate knitting. I just don't want to sit all the time in every
news bulletin I ever watch.    see it all the time. We are suffering
from saturation coverage. It is on radio, television, every way you
look. Obviously it would be unreasonable to expect the match is
not to be covered, but do we have to have pundits discussing the
flexibility or temperament of the ball? I gather the England
goalkeeper made a bit of a pig's ear of a saved during the week and
I am sure he does not want to be reminded of it any more than we do.
I am not a football fan, but I have seen it many times and the poor
bloke missed it. Do we need to see it in every news bulletin
afterwards? Is it really right for television to repeat what the
newspapers have already said? Football is dominating everything
in our lives. Let's face it, every night on the news someone is
introduced as, bringing us all the sport. Well, it is normally 99.99 %
sport    football. When the sport comes on, I start to count the
bricks around the fireplace. It seems that there are another three
weeks to go. Come on, BBC. Give the football for the football fans and
keep the news for the news. Well, we asked BBC news for a statement
in response to the concerns of John and other viewers. This is what
Now, a couple of rather suggest you have been e mailing us about. One
of them is a big story regarding And Dorota Kuzniar had a different
Now, many of you object to the number of celebrity stories on BBC
News. Even if you don't find the lives of the stars fascinating, you
may feel they should be up for scrutiny if they are receiving
money and adulation. But with interviews been managed by managers
and PR people, are some public figures becoming untouchable? I had
been investigating in the last about series, not for broadcast.   
in the last of our series not for broadcast. The enduring appeal of
Madam Tussauds his power to the Testament of celebrity. However,
into views like these to sell films, books and albums are strictly
controlled. They end abruptly if the wrong questions are asked.
Meanwhile, a broadcasting negative stories can be huge. In 2008, Max
Mosley was £16,000 and around £1 million in costs after the News of
the world reported his sex session with prostitutes. It was the    Bay
Tree development in the privacy laws. Tiger was also took out an
injunction to prevent the media publishing naked pictures of him.
British papers were gagged and it seems that the UK law is being used
to restrict freedom of expression. The courts can go even further to
protect celebrities. When John Terry learned that the News of the
work was about to publish the story of his affair with a team mate's
former girlfriend, he took out an injunction stopping anyone even
referring to the existence of the court order as well as the story.
Though it was overturned in the High Court, there are many other
orders regarding celebrities that we might not know anything about.
If you knew about them, you would not have an argument. They are
medical records, computer hacking, you would not argue with it. It is
of is the private. Is there not something odd about the so called
Super injunctions? Let me give you an example. If you are a celebrity.
We will call you Betty and you go to your doctor because you are not
feeling well and your doctor takes your blood test and said it up and
the results come back and Betty has got cancer. Before Betty is told,
someone in the hospital has run of the News of the world or some other
newspaper and said, the celebrity has got cancer. Penny £10,000. 35
down and get an injunction and stopped her medical records coming
out. If we did not get a civil injunction then everyone would be
wondering what was in the medical records and she would be under huge
pressure to tell people what is in them and it is of us be private.
But don't celebrity set themselves up as heroes? There should be under
scrutiny. It is a good defence that if a person is project and one
image and doing something in private, the judge will not uphold
the injunction. Is the UK media more intrusive? It has taken a
battering with privacy laws. In the heydays in the 1990s it was
extremely intrusive, but now the media have learnt that there is the
weapon of privacy law. It can be used against them and they are much
more careful about what they do. in the face of this, what chance
does BBC News have to challenge the behaviour of celebrities? It is
very easy if we are seeing them misbehaving. But they did on camera,
in front of photographers, when I've seen them doing it then yes,
talk about it. When it appears in the newspapers and someone is
saying, they saw someone doing something, or a source said, it
becomes very different. Is it a problem that lawyers in to be
increasingly getting in the way with injunctions and Supreme
junctions? The number of legal letters has gone up, there was no
question about it. The areas in which they normally operates are on
stories that I don't touch. It is usually to do with children, what
it is to do with love lives and very rarely do those sorts of
stories appear on our news. Most of the stuff get out one way or
another. The problem is his broadcasting it sometimes. People
read stuff in America that has different libel lost to us and we
could never have the level of evidence and proof that could get
it through the British courts. There is a different standard of
proof in America. Have they been in the have any stories that and in
the public interest that you have not been ever to report? I cannot
think of a story that I have felt was truly in the public interest
that we have strong evidence of that we couldn't actually broadcast
at the end of the day. Normally, our lawyers are saying, you have
got enough evidence, go with it. Fans like these and the best of us
may feel reassured, but the existence of the Supreme junction
means we cannot easily decide for ourselves. We just do not know what
we are not being told. Finally, Surrey to return to the football,
but the BBC was bombarded this week with complaints about a certain
buzzing sound that featured not just in the broad    broadcaster
will cop noises, but on the news as well. He is Ben Brown again.   
World Cup noises. There is no truth in the room that that all BBC
presenters have been issued with their own vuvuzela. If you want to

There will be no at vuvuzelas during this weather forecast! For
the weekend, the weather is cutting up rough. A call wind blowing in.
It will be quite chilly. The cold air pushing in behind this band of
rain. It has been wet across South Wales and it will not clear until
the early hours. Most places have an overnight    most places will
have a colder night. On Saturday you will notice that those strong
winds. The basic rule is the further west you well, your chances
of getting sunshine increase. A good day coming up in Glasgow as
well. But the best we can manage is 13 degrees along the eastern side
of England. It really will not feel like a summer's day. You need to
head west where the winds will be a lighter. There will be more
sunshine. Devon and Cornwall and South Wells should not feel too bad.
Still only mid teens, temperature wise. A fresh appeal across
Northern Ireland as well. By contrast, there is plenty of
sunshine across South Africa. Despite being the middle of winter,
the temperatures are similar to ours. It will be a fine day for all
of tomorrow's games. Back here, more in the way of sunshine on a
