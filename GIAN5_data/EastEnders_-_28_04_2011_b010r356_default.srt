Was that my phone?
What did you expect?
Better than this.
Mum. Just wondering if...
Dad said anything? You must've talked, right?
Just let me know what he said.
What?
Am I getting old?
  Yeah.
  That's not even funny.
Look, I'm getting wrinkles.
  It's not good.
  Look, it's all good, big man. Promise you.
At first I was going to tear it up.
But then I thought, no,
you can do it. And I'll watch.
  Are you crazy?
  Do it!
We have until the end of the week. Then the bailiffs come and take everything.
No one'll be working tomorrow.
You want us to lose the restaurant?
Our home? Everything that we own? Do you?
I am tired of you sneaking around. First it was Syed, and now this?
How dare you?
I thought our son was going to die, how could I not go to him?
You are making a fool of me.
When are you going to get it into that thick head of yours
that actually our prayers have been answered?
Yusef was in your prayers, OK.
It's just a loan, we'll pay it back as soon as we can.
  No worries. I'll find the money.
  When?
  I'll get it.
  How?
  I will get it!
  What, by gambling with Phil Mitchell?
  No, Zee. I think you'll find I'm better than that.
  Ok. Tell me.
I will get it. You'll see.
I promise. You'll see.
What's so special about that day?
Er, dunno.
Is it the big wedding?
Oh, you're going, are you?
You'll miss it, it's the wrong day.
  What?
  Just wondering why you won't tell me.
If you must know, it's family business.
I'm taking Jack out, cheer him up.
Oh, you're worried about him now, are you?
Yeah, I've always been worried about him.
So not calling him, not going round to see him, that's your way of showing him you care.
  Well, I hope he's telepathic, Max.
  Just giving him a bit of space, ain't I?
Call him now.
I think he'd appreciate it.
God save my mummy...
  So, my darling, are you ready for the big day today?
Oh, you fool!
Hey, Tomster.
  What's the plans today?
  Alfie! Give us a hand.
  Me farmers are killing me.
  Get Jean to help you.
Her and Kim Fox are camping up west hoping to get a glimpse of the Prince.
  Them two in a tent?
  Fiver says only one of 'em comes out alive.
Tell you what, you keep an eye on the baby. Kat, give us a hand with this, then, sweetheart, yeah?
What?
  Thought we could close up tomorrow.
  But there's money to be made, girl.
  Kat, who'd want to close up?
  Me. I do.
I thought we could have the day off. You, me...and him.
Him?
Kat, I've got a special licence to open up early, I've got deliveries, I've shelled out for all this.
All right, suit yourself. Go make yourself a fiver.
It's all right, darling.
  Him?
  I'll tell you later.
What's that?
That guy you met, Martin.
Wants you to give him a call.
  Really? What, he said that?
  Yeah.
You must be doing something right, eh?
All right, babe?
Well, are you feeling lucky?
  Oh, well, even if I was...
  Oh, I won't tell if you don't.
  Honestly, I can't.
  Everybody buys a scratchcard now and again.
Anyway, listen, when your luck's in your luck's in.
  Merce!
  What?
  Run!
  What?
  Just run!
  Just run!
  Why are you running?
  Arthur!
  What is this?
  I was waving to you.
  Gran! What are you doing here? You never said.
  It's the royal wedding!
I'm not missing that. What were you running for?
Yeah, why were we running?
I, uh, I saw Mrs O, and I thought it'd be funny,
to, you know, a little joke... UNCONVINCINGLY
Syed, you can't come in here.
You didn't call me back, I was worried.
I did call back.
Sorry, I left my phone in the flat.
  Well?
  We have to take small steps with this, OK? We can't rush it.
This could work, mum.
I know. Right now we've got two days to come up with a lot of money.
How much? Maybe I could help.
Don't worry, your father has a plan.
He's not...?
  If nothing else he'll do it to spite Yusef.
  Yusef?
What's he got to do with anything?
No, you've got to give him a chance, Mum. The way you gave me a chance.
But this is about the business, this is about our home.
And he knows that. So just sit tight.
He'll come good. He has to.
Let's just hope your father comes through, then.
Hey.
  Hiya. Did you win?
  Did you?
I haven't called him yet.
  Don't keep him waiting.
  What if he's not really, really interested?
Course he is, you're lovely. And you're lucky. You won me 50 quid.
No, no, you did, your two quid bought the card.
  We're watching the wedding tomorrow.
  No, we ain't.
  Yes, we are.
  No, we ain't. I'm losing a day's business thanks to the royals.
Don't think I'm going to be sitting there celebrating.
It's out of order, ain't it, Jack?
  Dunno.
  I mean, who are they, anyway?
Just people, that's all they are.
People with poncey, plummy voices.
  That's it. Big deal.
  You're jealous.
Jealous, what you talking about?
I'm just a working man, ain't I? Solid citizen.
I don't need some stuck up Hooray Henry ruining my Friday, thank you very much.
  In fact, Jack, if you fancy it, we're going to get away for the day.
  Are we?
  Day on the beach.
  I'll make sure I've got my bucket and spade.
Just thought it'd be good, you know, get away from it all.
  Mo, in here.
  All right, mind me arm. I'm delicate.
You know that money you gave us?
Don't tell me you've spent it already.
No, course I haven't, but I'm going to, on a christening.
A massive, big christening. I want everyone to gather round
and witness our little boy be given his rightful handle.
  I like it.
  It's a brilliant idea.
I want to show Kat that we're doing it legal, religious and proper.
  Alfie.
  What?
  Jack, I'm sorry, mate, I...
  No worries.
C'mon, genius, let's go and make some calls.
What?
Oh, it's just we're going to be leaving early.
Don't forget your trunks.
You know what, I might give this one a miss. Think I'm busy.
You know you said it was your lucky day?
How lucky? I mean, if Patrick can win, so can I.
I thought real gambling was against your religion?
  Yeah, well, it is, but you'd be the one putting down the money.
  But in your name, though.
Yeah, details. Anyway, Zainab needs her prayers answering, doesn't she?
I don't know anything about horses.
You don't need to. You just need to have a gut feeling.
  You'd put money on that?
  I've got a gut feeling about you.
  Any horse?
  The winner would be good.
  Oh.
Cruella rang.
  Try under C for church.
  Mo, I do know how to spell, thank you, sweetheart.
  Why you looking under P, then?
  P is for priests, P is for parsons and...
persons of religion.
  Delivery man's here.
  I'll be right through.
What you two doing?
Nothing, love of my life.
Yeah, mind your own.
Just put that away, will you?
You two are up to something, I know it.
Don't be silly! No, no, no, no...
Alfie. What's with all the bubble?
Apparently this is Kate Middleton's favourite cocktail. It's called crack baby.
Apparently it's champagne, vodka, and passion fruit. Listen, it's only three quid a pop, lads. Fancy one?
A Phil Mitchell special? Don't think so. Two orange juices, please.
  Coming up.
  You're a gent.
  You, however, are not.
  I was going to tell you.
  Yeah.
It was Mum who came to see me at the hospital. She thought I was dying.
  Hoped so, more like.
  Not fair.
You can't seriously believe she's changed.
It's different this time. It is.
  Here you go.
  Cheers, mate.
  Listen,
I hope you two are going to be here tomorrow for the big day. Kick off at ten o'clock.
I'm going right out. Big TV screen, fancy cocktails.
  It's a fiver to get in, only to cover expenses.
  Yeah, maybe. Then again, maybe not.
You must remember when Di got married.
I remember sitting with my nan watching that. She cried all the way through it. Could be tears tomorrow!
See, I'm looking old.
You'll be joining us tomorrow, Arthur?
I will? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, no worries.
  I'll be there waving my flag.
  You've got a flag?
  I can get one.
  Get one for Seb as well. He's coming round.
  Oh, OK. Right, cool.
  I'm looking forward to meeting him. Heard nothing but good things.
  He's lovely, Gran. Isn't he?
  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The best!
  Max has gone. We can talk properly now.
  About?
Whatever you want.
I didn't know we were friends.
OK. I'll just sit here, then.
I'm going to get James' headstone changed.
  Get his proper name on it.
I can't have him laying there with somebody else's name above him.
What did they say? Can they do it?
I ain't called 'em yet.
  Here.
  No, it's all right. Just...sort my head out and I'll do it.
Just tell me what to say.
  Hang on. That's it.
  Come on, run!
  That's it, go on, come on, come on!
  C'mon, c'mon!
Go! Yes! Yes!
How much? How much?
11/1, times 50, that's 500 plus!
500? Feel that. It's going faster than the horse. Does it always feel like that?
Er, Jane, can I have my hand back?
Oh, right. Wow, that was something to remember.
Yes, it was. What you doing?
I'm going to get your money, then I've got to finish up at the cafe and get to the Vic.
  There are more races.
  No.
I don't think I could take any more.
Look, I know it's wrong, but I don't think I've got a choice.
  Something's happening.
  Is it?
Yeah something in the air, can't you feel it?
  You've got the touch.
  No, no, no, that was just luck, Masood.
  Have I?
  Yeah! I think you have!
Thing is...
I need it. More money, that is.
I shouldn't even be...
I need to win again.
  There we go.
  Oh, thanks, darling, I'm starving.
  One veggie and one game pie.
Game? I ordered chicken.
Chicken is game, twice removed.
Look, just say, right, just say it all goes beautifully with Godzilla.
What about Masood?
  We'll work on him, but we'll get there.
  It's all going to end badly. Look at the last time.
We've been to those places, no one wants to go there again. I know it, Mum knows it.
What, you think Masood's just going to shake your hand and say "Welcome home, son?"
  Well, that's what I want.
  Explain to me how it works again.
Yeah, OK. PHONE RINGS
  Mo, can you get that? Mo, can you get the phone, love?
  I'm busy!
Good luck.
Hello, Queen Vic.
Alfie Moon?
No, he's busy at the moment. I'm his wife, can I take a message?
Sorry? Sorry, what christening?
We're celebrating. We just won a pony on a horse.
There's a circus trick I want to see! What?
  A monkey's 500 quid.
  All right, I'm learning the lingo.
  She's on a roll, you know.
  I've been on loads of rolls.
Look at me, I'm a mega millionaire with me own yacht.
  This is different.
  Yeah?
  Yeah.
  You think you've got the touch, do you, sweetheart?
  I think I have.
  There's a phone call for you.
  I'll be in in a second, sweetheart.
  It's about the christening.
We should, uh...
Yeah, you're right. We should.
Excuse me.
Well?
  One name.
  Yeah, I know.
So?
I'm not getting anything.
  No?
  No, sorry.
Come on. This is the last time. I'm never going to do anything like this again.
  Maybe you should just stop now.
  I can't, I need to win!
Calm down.
All right, all right. OK. Sorry, sorry.
You're right. Let's just leave it.
I'll think of something else.
Nothing's coming. I'm sorry.
It's all right. Leave it.
Wait. Mas...
Yeah?
Where are you, Mas? I need to know what's going on.
I haven't heard a thing, so can you call me?
  Hey, could I get these, please?
  Four.
  Have you seen my husband?
  No, sorry.
But throw in a finder's fee and I'll go find him for you.
  Arthur!
  Look, I got them.
  Oh, no.
  I can't believe it.
  Look, I'm so sorry.
I am so, so, sorry. I didn't know he was going to tell on you, OK,
I swear I didn't. And if it makes you feel any better I hate him for it.
  You knew?
  Yeah, I was going to say, but I just didn't know how to.
Seb told you?
  Seb? Who's talking about Seb?
  I am. Who are you talking about?
  Uh...
  I can't believe he'd just ditch me.
He didn't even say why, just said he needed a break.
You know what, he is not a nice guy.
When did you see him?
You know what, Merce, you've got to forget about him, all right?
Look, you have to.
OK, and I'm swearing this to you,
Fats is going to make you smile.
Come here, baby girl.
It was supposed to be a surprise.
It was. Don't worry.
Kat, you can't call him nothing for the rest of his life.
  I'll think of something, I've got a book of names.
  He's already got a name.
  That sort of got lost.
  No. His name is Tommy.
  He's our boy.
  We buried Tommy.
His name went with him. It's on his headstone.
We both picked that name, we loved it. It was perfect.
Perfect for bringing us bad luck.
Kat, we did not have bad luck, all right?
Jack and Ronnie, they had bad luck. We had good luck.
He found his way home, darling. Think of him like a homing baby, yeah?
Jokes will not get you your christening.
  So what will, then?
  We'll come up with a new name.
He's already got a name. His name is Tommy Moon.
He's our son. This little boy is our future. So his name is Tommy Moon.
So you say it, all right?
You say it. Just say the name.
We'll think of something else.
Are you sure?
Look at me. Are you?
No.
  No?
  Yes!
  Yes, you're not sure?
  No. Yes, I am sure.
Which one is it, Jane?
It feels right. Definitely. Right.
What if I'm wrong?
You haven't been so far.
Erm...
Do it.
To win.
  Masood, I can't watch.
  Jane...
No, no, I can't. I'm sorry. And please don't hate me if it all goes, you know...
Why did I tear up that cheque? What was I thinking?
Relax. I saw Dad earlier, and he looked pretty excited.
Really? What was he doing?
Well, he was in the Vic, and he seemed...
In the Vic? Where's he going to find £10,000 in the Vic?
You know what, Syed, here, cover for me.
  Mum...
  No, Syed, I need to find him.
  There's plenty of time.
There isn't plenty of time. We could lose everything.
All couples have rows, all right?
It came out of nowhere.
He was probably having a bad day or something, yeah?
Just give him some time and I'm sure he'll realise what he's missing.
  You so have a way of saying the right thing.
  Yeah, I wish I did.
You do. You're a great friend, Arthur, probably the only person I know I can truly trust.
It's all right, OK.
Dan Mansard, UK Border Agency.
Have you got a minute, Miss Olubunmi?
Border what?
Immigration, for want of a better word.
Arthur?
Just...nod or shake your head.
  We did it!
  Oh, my God!
  I know.
  Seven?
  Eight.
  Thousand?
  Count it. SHE GASPS
Days like these, they come round once in a million years.
Mas, you've got enough now!
I'm a little short, but it's close enough.
  Alfie. I like Theopholis.
  Mo, will you stop?
Norman, then!
Fancy a drink?
Will it help?
Depends what you need help for.
You ever, um...? Nah.
  What?
  I dunno.
You ever wished for the impossible and had it come true?
I thought it had...once.
Alfie. Is Kat about?
  Yeah, she's upstairs. Shall I...?
  Actually, d'you mind if I...
Tell you what, think it'd be best if I went and got her.
  You all right?
  Yeah.
  Jack?
You couldn't spare us a minute, could you?
  There you are! I've been looking all over for you!
  Well, here I am.
Well?
  What?
  What do you mean, "What?" The restaurant, the bailiffs!
  Oh, yeah.
  Come on, man!
Well, I've got the money.
  No. Really?
  Really.
  All of it?
  Nearly all of it.
  Promise me.
  On Kamil's life.
  You did it?
  I did it!
  I don't understand. How did you do it?
  Well, I'm a good man,
and good things happen to good men.
Mum?
Hi.
We'll celebrate later.
Mum, you saw that, right?
I believe I did.
You sure you're OK in here?
You live with your grandmother, Grace, that correct?
Uh, yeah.
  What is this actually about?
  And you've been going to Walford High School?
Yeah. Have I done something wrong?
You then went back to Nigeria and re entered the UK on a six month visa.
Which expired in December.
Are you going to make me leave? Is that what this is about?
You've been here four months past your permit.
Which isn't quite right. Is it?
He's in the front room if you was wondering.
No, it's you I came to see.
Yeah, you said, but no offence, you've just been sitting there.
Yeah. And you've been pottering around pretending to do stuff.
  Here.
  Thanks.
So...
Yeah.
Um...
I made a phone call earlier.
Well, Vanessa did.
I paid over the odds for it, cos I want to get it done now.
There ain't going to be any headstone with Tommy's name on it.
  I'd never thought...
  I'm going to get it changed.
You know, replaced, removed, whatever.
Just seems right.
Jack, I'm so sorry.
  I just need you to sign off.
  Yeah, whatever you need.
I just want to make sure everything's the right way round.
Do you want to see him?
I know you haven't since...
Yeah, I do.
But I'm going to see my boy first.
I just feel that's right.
Jack...
Come over any time, yeah?
Jane. Yeah, I've been thinking.
No, no come on, listen, wait a second.
We're on a roll. We can't lose.
Come on, Jane, can't you see what's happening today?
So if I were to read you out some names...
Come on. I could double my money.
So just listen, and if you get that feeling, you just tell me, OK? Deal?
Jane, it's just one more race, I promise.
I've heard about this horse, it's a 7/2 odds on favourite,
and I just wondered if it would've been the horse you'd have picked.
Huh? Jane? Jane?
Listen, Kat, sweetheart, about the christening, I'm not going to keep on about it.
  Just shut up a minute.
  Yeah, I know, I promise, but it was only...
  Hold on.
Hello. Yeah, I spoke to you earlier, about the christening.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
  I want to go ahead with it.
  She's thought of a name, then.
It's for my little boy.
Tommy.
Tommy Moon.
(He did find his way home.)
  (I love you.)
  (I love you.)
OK, my prince...
show me the money!
