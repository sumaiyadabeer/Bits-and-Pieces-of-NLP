Amongst all this stuff, we believe that there are bargains to be found.
And to prove it, let's go bargain hunting!
We're in Devon with some local teams,
two sisters versus a husband and wife.
But who are going to make the most fruitful decisions?
'The girls give their expert a tough time.'
That IS antique to me and to Claire.
  Not saying you're antique!
  No. Just the shoes.
'Charming(!) The blues seem to lose their expert altogether.'
It's back over there. Go! Come on!
  Where have they gone?
  'How will it all shake out?'
Now, let's meet everyone on Bargain Hunt.
  We've got Katie and Claire, sisters, for the reds. Hi, girls.
  Hello.
Katie, you are the elder and eldest of several.
Yes. Claire's one of my sisters. There's 11 months between us.
I've got three other sisters.
  Five of you in the family!
  Five girls.
  That's quite something.
Your poor father! How does he cope?
  Well, he has an ally in the dog. The dog's a boy.
  So, two old dogs!
Well, that's marvellous.
  I'm studying theology.
Are you very religious?
Yes, I am a committed Christian.
My whole family is. We go to Exeter Cathedral.
I'm studying with my fiance, Jonathan, who's going to be a vicar.
  Would you like to be a vicar, too?
  No. I'd actually like to go into teaching when I've finished.
  When you're not studying, what do you like to do?
  We like shopping.
I like going to Camden Market in London.
I bought a purple Indian rug for a bargain.
You'll be pleased that I got it for £20.
  Yes.
  I saw one in a shop at home and it was £120!
  Never?
  Mm hm.
  Straight up?
  Yeah. Mm hm.
I would say you're going to be a bit of a devil on this programme.
Now, you've got a good eye. What about your little sister?
  Oh, I've got a very good eye, Tim.
  Have you?
  Yeah.
  Are you a student, too?
  No, I'm a full time mum to my son Joshua, who's nine months.
  Congratulations. Is he a bundle of trouble?
  Yes. He's just started crawling.
  What do you do in your spare time?
  Me and my husband Nick love the great outdoors.
  You take Josh with you?
  Yes.
  Is he a pretty tough egg?
  Yeah. He's like his dad.
Would you say you're a natural bargain hunter?
Oh, yeah. I don't like to pay full ticket price for anything.
  Haggle is the name of the game.
  You're going to have fun today.
  Yes.
We're looking forward to seeing what you buy. Good luck.
  Steve and Joy.
  Hello.
  How long have you two been married?
  We've been married 31 years.
  Have you?
  We have indeed.
  You have an incredibly important job.
  Um, well... Yes.
I'm the manager of Exeter Food Bank. It's been going about two years.
We provide emergency food for people who are in crisis.
A crisis is defined for the food bank as people who have no food and no money to buy food.
  This is aid within Britain?
  This is within Exeter city.
  Within Exeter itself?
  There's 100 food banks across the country.
  Gosh! I had no idea!
  Yes, it's a huge and growing movement.
As recession kicks in, it's getting more in demand.
  We give a third of a tonne of food a week.
  Good Lord!
  To people who wouldn't have food otherwise.
  That must be thoroughly worthwhile.
  It's very satisfying.
  Thank you for telling us about it.
  Thank you for asking.
  Steve, what do you do?
  I'm a self employed painter and decorator.
I've been doing it for 30 years, off and on.
  What do you like best about the job?
  It's meeting people, for a start.
I meet lots of local people.
Doing a good job for them.
Just enjoying the way they look at their living room or landing and say, "Wonderful! Well done!"
On some occasions, you use modest amounts of paint, don't you?
Yes, I do enjoy painting on a canvas as well as walls.
I also like painting miniatures,
one of which I have here.
  Which you just happen to have brought with you.
  Yes.
  Look at that!
And is that a lane near you?
It's where we used to live, a little lane coming up to our house.
Thank you very much for showing us.
Anyway, the money moment.
The moment you've been waiting for. £300 apiece. You know the rules.
Your experts await, and off you go! And very, very, very good luck.
Our red team is joined by summer loving Philip Serrell.
And the blues will be skipping round with Catherine Southon. Lovely.
  Now, have we got a plan?
  Yeah.
  Which is?
  Spend as little money as possible.
Something small. Something silver.
  Silver!
  Walking sticks.
  Walking sticks?
Quality, quirky, unusual, no money. This is gonna be a miracle.
'Plenty of fascinating stalls here in Exeter. Can our teams cash in?'
  That one's pretty.
  That's pretty?
  Yeah.
You'll appreciate I don't do much handbag buying.
  That's quite short.
  It is quite short.
Do me!
'The girls have spotted some brown furniture. Is that a lectern?'
We should have bought that for you! Or your fiance.
'Steve and Joy have discovered a box of goodies.'
  Is that Tunbridge ware?
  Yes. It looks like a paper knife.
Or envelope opener. The quality is good. It's in nice condition.
Late 19th century tourist ware. What would be your best on that?
  I'm afraid it's only 40.
  Right. OK. Fair enough.
Realistically, if we want to put it into auction,
we'd have to get it at around 20.
'Well, it's a possibility.
'Phil's found something sharp. Will this cut it with Claire and Katie?'
It's mother of pearl.
It's hallmarked silver. A little fruit knife. £28. Do you like that?
  Not revved up with enthusiasm here!
  Not revved up. No.
  No.
  Fine.
I know my place.
'Try a wool winder on them, Phil.'
  Do you like that?
  I've not seen one before.
  No.
Look at this!
If ever a face told a thousand words!
Let me see if I can impersonate that!
  Was that it?
  That's close!
'Meanwhile, Joy's spotted a giant cup! I think.'
  Oak wine sloop.
  A what?
'Is it a scoop or a sloop? It's a scoop.'
Oh, scoop! I read it as "sloop"! How old is that, then?
That is the short of thing Philip Serrell would buy.
1910, somewhere around that, or a bit earlier.
It's French. They scooped it out the barrel to taste it. Hand carved.
  It's interesting but I'm wondering if it's that commercial...
  No.
  That's fine.
  ..where we're going.
  Onward and upward.
  You said it.
'Ah! Katie's found some miniature footwear.'
  That IS antique to me.
  And to Claire.
  Not saying you're antique!
No, just the shoes.
  That's not very nice, is it?
  If your shoes are 1975, they could be worth a bit.
  I'm here to help you.
  Yeah.
  You're telling me I'm antique.
'Those girls are just not treating our expert seriously.'
It's a cigar holder. Telescopic, which is nice.
You open it up, put your little... cigarette, really.
  What was the best price on that?
  We can keep looking a bit more.
  We've got plenty of time.
  At the moment. The panic crashes in at the last ten minutes!
  What are you thinking so far?
  It's great fun!
'Holding hands! How sweet!
'Claire and Katie are hard to please. What's that Phil's got now?'
This is a nut.
You two, you can't hide the way you feel, can you?
  You cannot! "This is a nut!" "What?"
  All right.
Just give me that look again. That's the one.
'Catherine's found some little nips.'
Oh! It's a shame we're not selling on the Isle of Man.
Are they Isle of Man? Sheffield 1912.
  But these legs, isn't that the Isle of Man?
  Yes.
Oh, what a shame.
How much are these? 35. >
Oh, aren't they pretty?
'Another possibility worth thinking about.
'What's Phil found? Can he sell it to the girls?'
They're steps off a boat,
  but I think they make fantastic house shelves.
  That's cool.
I like them.
I think they're wicked and they'd make a very cool set of shelves.
I've got me coat caught in there. If you put those into auction...
  Do you want help?
  No.
We've seen three items that we sort of like. The Tunbridge ware.
  You like your cigarette holder.
  I've gone off that.
  Oh, you've gone off that?
  Yes.
  What's she like?
  Well, it just seems a bit basic.
  A bit basic.
It's Bakelite and base metal.
  Well, it's such a huge place!
  Right! Come on!
  We've got more to look at.
'Catherine's getting anxious about time. She's determined to find better prospects.
'Perhaps an arty magic lantern slide for Steve.'
  Makes you go a bit funny.
  Like ironing a checked shirt.
Would you be prepared to do something outrageously foolhardy?
  Go for 22?
  < No, I'm sorry.
No? Not even outrageous at 25?
< No. The best I can do is £29.
Just one on its own in a sale at that price,
I'm not sure you'll make a profit.
'OK. It's staying on the "possibles" list.
'Half the shopping time's gone and no one's bought anything!'
  I like these.
  Let's have a look.
  They're decorative.
They're nice things.
  Port and starboard.
  The handle's missing.
  65 for the pair.
We could ask for a bit off for the handle.
I think they're quite nice.
  In your house, they're quite quirky.
  Yeah. I like them.
What was the best you could do on these? Please?
55. And that's very good value for a pair. >
For a pair. I know there's a ring missing. >
  Would you take 50?
  I would take 50. >
That's because the ring's missing. >
  Yeah?
  Do you want to buy them?
  You actually want to buy something?
  You have a deal.
  Thank you.
'The reds are up and running.'
They bought something! They bought something!
'And the blues have found a strange stick.'
  Isn't that lovely with the snake?
  All the way down.
  There's no real damage to it.
  No.
  Is there, in the wood?
What was your best price on that?
The very best would be 110. < Would it? Yeah.
This is possibly worth much more. It might be North American. >
It doesn't look particularly English.
I'm not a specialist in walking sticks.
Well, we've got a man who is.
  It's quite nice with the coin set in the top.
  And the coin is...?
Queen Anne. > < Could you do it for 90?
Um...
I can't. 110 really is it. I think there is money in that.
  I think we have to nudge it below.
I said 110. I'll go to 100.
< OK. What do we say? That is it. 100.
  That's a reasonable price.
  It's your call.
  I say yes.
  I say yes.
  Yes.
  Sold.
  < Thank you very much.
  You're very welcome.
  Thank you very much.
For all of you who say there's nothing but boring brown furniture
in these fairs, this is the antithesis of brown furniture.
It's something that is so much the look of the late '50s.
What's great about it is the design.
What we've got is a complete wrap around series of panels
across the front, which have been decorated
with oddball spiky musical instruments
and look, to me, very much like the work of a furniture designer
and interior decorator
Piero Fornasetti.
What I like is that it comes complete with this back unit.
The back unit is made out of two As   an upright A
and an upside down A.
The top part supports a unit with a sliding door,
behind which you'd keep your glasses or your bottles.
Above that, there's a sheet of plate glass.
And underneath, a curious brass frilly topped container
that looks a bit like a jardiniere,
but you'd have kept additional bottles in it.
The ultimate sign of quality, I think, is the top of the bar,
which is in solid marble, a lovely pink brown variegated marble
that would have cost a lot of money at the time.
So what's a unit like this worth?
Well, the dealer who rescued it from France is asking £1,850.
And at that, I think I could get...quite thirsty.
'So, what are our teams up to?
'Claire fancies a clock. What does Phil think?'
So who's it by?
It's a Birmingham hallmark. Does it work?
Did do, before you played with it.
It's the Ansonia Clock Co, so this is an American movement
that would have been manufactured in Massachusetts or somewhere.
It would have been shipped over to this country in 1905, 1910
and put in this silver case.
  You like it, don't you?
  Yeah. I do.
How much have you spent so far?
  And what's the best on that?
I'll do it for 180, just to get rid of you.
How much do you think it'll make at auction?
I think it's gonna make between £120 and £180.
Can you come down any more?
I'll smile at you sweetly.
  Please.
  175, and that's really it.
'Girls, time is ticking away.
'The blues are starting to panic!'
We've got about just under 15 minutes. What do you want to do?
  What about the sugar tongs?
  Yeah. I think it'd be good to get those.
'OK, they've got a plan. Can the girls get the clock price down?'
Could you take the five off?
What else are you going to buy?
Well, Claire will give you a kiss, how's that?
Oh, dear. Go on! We like it.
  And a handshake.
  And a handshake?
As long as he doesn't give me the kiss.
Robert, let me assure you, that will not be in the equation.
  Where have we got to?
  170 on the clock.
  170 on the clock.
  That's it, is it? She likes the clock.
  Yes.
  Thank you.
'You nearly made a man happy!
'The reds have two items. What about the blues?'
  Yes, it is. Oh, no, it's not.
  'They're lost.
'They've lost Catherine as well. It's a big hall.
'They're in big trouble.'
It's back over there. Go! Come on!
'Katie's having a rest.
'No. She's trying out a chair.'
Does it come off completely?
'No. She's breaking a chair. Get out of there, girls!'
Help!
'Joy and Steve have found their nips again.'
We were wondering whether you'd do them for 25.
No. I can't. 35. 35. Could we meet halfway?
Say 30? Please?
Reg, can we let these go for 30?
Can you let them go for 30?
  Just this once?
  Please, Reg?
Just this once. > Thank you, Reg, very much!
That's great. We'll do that, then.
'So both teams have two items, but time's almost up.'
  We've got three minutes left.
  Where...?
  I don't want you to feel under pressure.
'Steve and Joy still can't find Catherine.'
Catherine. Catherine!
Where have they gone?
Catherine!
Shall we stand on a chair and call her?
I can't believe it. I just went back to see about that slide.
The gorgeous slide. And it's gone!
  That would have been the best third thing. Did you get the tongs?
  Yes.
  We got them for 30.
  Great.
  OK. What's your third item?
  Don't know.
We were going to go back not necessarily to the Tunbridge ware thing, but at that stall.
'Meanwhile, the reds are eyeing up a magnifying glass and a funny fork,
'if you see what I mean.'
  Is it plastic?
  No, it's not plastic. It's horn.
It's got little silver mounts on it and a little Scottish thistle.
I think it's better than a magnifying glass.
  You've got to buy the fork or the magnifier.
  How much is the fork?
  Ten!
  Listen.
  Which do you like better?
  I like that one. It's more unusual.
OK. And what's the price? Best price?
  15 and a kiss.
But not from me.
  Look, I've got it. 15 and two kisses, one each!
  Deal!
  Deal!
'Too much kissing, I'd say. He's developing a taste for it.
'They've got three items, by hook or by snog!
  'Now, where are those blues?'
  Shall we do the wine scoop?
See if you can get it really cheap. Go. We've got no time.
The very best I'd do is £60.
There are four people who are interested in it.
  Could we do 55?
  Go on. I'll do 55.
  Oh, thank you!
  Do you want that?
  I think it's interesting.
  Let's go for it. >
< It's caused a lot of interest here.
  Sold! I think!
Thank you.
We must be mad!
Time's up. Why don't we check out how the reds spent their cash?
'They got a pair of ship's running lights for £50.
'The silver clock set them back 170.
'And they pitched £15 on a horn pickle fork.'
Listen, you sisters, have you been falling out?
  W well...
  Yeah.
  Just a bit! How's the referee getting on?
  He's had a fraught 59 minutes, but we got there, didn't we?
  Yes.
  Anyway, you spent up pretty well. What's your total?
  235, we spent.
235! That's a first rate number. So £65 of leftover lolly, please.
  There you go.
  Thank you very much. £65 goes straight to the man.
Good luck with that, Phil.
Meanwhile, why don't we check out what the blues are doing?
'A walking stick carved with rattle snakes cost them £100.
'Silver nips with Manx man forks came in at 30.
'And a huge wooden scoop was lifted for 55.'
  Steve and Joy, was that pure joy?
  It was great fun, thank you.
  Pure joy!
  Shopping with other people's money is always good.
  Wonderful, yes.
  You're lucky having Catherine, too.
  Yeah. We loved it.
  Thank you.
  How much did you spend?
So £115 of leftover lolly somewhere, please. Thank you. £115.
Catherine, what are you going to spend that on?
  Something that will sparkle.
  Lovely.
  Something blingy!
Something for the girls! I think there's a hint there!
Meanwhile, I feel a bit of a castle coming on.
Sherborne Castle really is in the most magnificent position.
A Tudor mansion just on the outskirts of Sherborne
in the county of Dorset.
It's currently the home of the Wingfield Digby family,
but once upon a time, it was the home of Sir Walter Raleigh,
who built the principal part of the property late in the 16th century.
The site was leased to Raleigh in 1592 by the first Queen Elizabeth.
She had a soft spot for him, but all that changed
when she discovered he'd secretly married her lady in waiting.
Fortunately, Raleigh didn't lose his head on that occasion.
Here in the red drawing room, we've got a delicious narrative picture
that shows Queen Elizabeth I, it is thought in 1600,
being transported by her noblemen.
Elizabeth herself is ageing but, of course, she's the Faerie Queene
and therefore, in all official pictures,
she's still plastered with white oxide make up
to cover up the pock marks in her skin caused by attacks of smallpox.
And she's portrayed as a relatively young woman,
despite being in her late 60s.
Famously, Raleigh threw his cloak across a puddle
to save the royal footwear.
He imported potatoes and tobacco.
He was a privateer, a sort of licensed pirate.
He would have been after booty,
which might have included exotic pieces of furniture like this.
This box is Indo Portuguese.
The Portuguese, in the early 1500s, discovered India
and they started importing exotic pieces like this,
which in turn became treasured by the princely households in Europe.
Nobody had seen anything quite like them.
What we've got here is a travelling box.
It's got a swing handle on the top.
It's a piece of furniture that is small and portable,
but extremely exotic.
Look at the density of inlay on this one panel.
We've got a Tree of Life, which centres on an ivory vase.
It sprouts such vigorous growth
that it completely fills that central reserve.
The best bit of all, I think, are these little babies in each corner.
What we've got here are mermaids with entwined scaly lower bodies,
all in ivory stained green.
Then they've got this curious wooden skirt.
The detail on the ivory has been created with red hot needles,
which have burnt the ivory.
They've rubbed in some black mastic,
so that you can see the contrasting lines and designs.
When you consider that this is only one surface of the box,
that the top and the sides are similarly covered,
you get to see just what an exotic inlaid effect this is.
The like of which would not have been seen in Europe.
The big question today is
what is our teams' booty likely to be worth over at the auction?
It's lovely to be at Tamlyn's saleroom in Bridgwater
  with our auctioneer, Claire Rawle. Good morning, Claire.
  Good morning.
First up are these navigation lamps.
Where do you think they might have been used?
On a yacht or a small pleasure craft. I don't think you'd see it on anything very large.
I think they were always made to be powered by electricity.
  They can't be earlier than 1900. They've got some age.
  They have.
You can tell from the brass. They have a look about them.
Actually nice quality, I think. Quite attractive items those.
  Got many old salts around these parts?
  Lots round these parts. Yes.
  Bridgwater was quite a busy port in its day.
  Good.
  What do you think they might bring?
  I've put 30 to 50 on them.
  The team paid £50, so they're at the top end, but they've got the look.
  I think so.
  What about this wacky timepiece? Do you like that?
  I like the case.
It's very pretty, but I'm not sure about the movement. It's Ansonia.
  They were mass produced. I'd prefer a nice French movement.
  How much?
  80 to 120.
  £170 paid.
  That's a tip top price.
  Mmmm.
  Last item is the horn fork.
  Yes.
  With its silver mounts.
  Yes.
  Would that be Scottish?
  Well, it's got a thistle on it!
And it's made of horn, so, yes.
  Bit of Scottish pickle forking.
  Yes. I assume it's a pickle fork.
  What's your estimate?
  £10 to £15.
  £15 they paid.
  Oh, right.
  And a nice clean little thing.
I bet you make a profit on that, but whether it will be sufficient
to catch up with the predicted losses likely to be made on the timepiece remains to be seen.
They're going to need their Bonus Buy, so let's have a look at it.
  Now, girls, 65 notes you gave the man, right?
  Yes.
  To go and find you
  the most profitable thing he could in the way of a Bonus Buy.
  Right.
I sort of tried.
  I bought that. Isn't that sweet?
  Ah!
  It's a little Mauchline ware crib.
  How much did you spend?
  Right...
  That's quite good.
You're looking completely under whelmed.
  Katie, are you all right, girl?
  I'll reserve judgment...
PHIL LAUGHS ..on this one.
  Claire?
  How much do you think it'll make?
I was hoping it'd make £30 to £50.
What would you do with it?
Well, look at it.
Right.
It's a piece of Mauchline ware. This was from Colwyn Bay.
When you went on holiday to Colwyn Bay in 1900, 1910,
this was a stick of rock you bought.
  When YOU went on holiday then.
  Oh! That's not nice!
Just a holiday memento, but I've never seen a crib.
You see lots of little boxes but I think it's a sweet thing.
  And I'm clearly on my own here.
  I wouldn't say that.
What would you use it for? You could put paperclips in it.
You could have it on your desk as a little novelty.
If you were in love with north Wales,
what better object could you have?
  Yes, exactly! I'm won over!
  Won over!
Now, for the viewers at home, let's find out what the auctioneeress thinks of Phil's crib.
What about that for a charming little collectable?
I thought that was quite sweet. Mauchline ware you see a lot of.
  But in the shape of a crib, it's rather unusual.
  Yes.
I don't know about the business of this image on the top.
  It's quite grubby.
  The image is a little dark.
Very often they get quite rubbed, so at least it is still there.
And the crib is unusual. Anyway, your estimate is...?
  30 to 50.
  Very good. Philip Serrell cunningly paid only £20.
  Excellent.
That's it for the reds. Now for the blues.
  First up is their stick. How do you rate that?
  I quite liked it.
Again, it's not an uncommon item. It has a good feel to it.
I think there's been a bit of an addition to the top.
  You think the knob's later?
  It hasn't got the same feel about it.
The Queen Anne coin has probably been hammered in.
Probably a while ago. I don't think it's that modern.
  But quite attractive.
  What's your estimate?
  60 to 100.
  £100 paid. They may struggle to get to 100.
  Mm.
  The sugar tongs?
  Sugar tongs.
Well, they're silver sugar tongs.
They've got the Isle of Man logo on. They're not terribly heavy.
Scrap value isn't awfully high.
It's those tourists going over from Lancashire to the Isle of Man and bringing a souvenir back.
  Quite. Yes.
  How much, then?
  Ten to 15.
  Oh, Lordy! £30 they paid.
  So that's not much cop.
  What about this hardwood mug thing?
  I think the question is, which country?
  Yes.
  I wonder whether it might be a bit of Indian village gear...
  Yeah.
..that's been cleared out and sent over.
  What's your estimate?
  I put 30 to 60 on it.
  Did you? £55 they paid.
  Oh, OK.
  Which is quite a whack for a rustic lump. They've got problems.
They're going to need their Bonus Buy, so let's go and have a look at it.
Now, Steve and Joy, this is your moment to find out what Catherine spent your £115 on.
Catherine, over to you!
  Oooh!
  We have a little cocktail shaker.
Not only is it a miniature cocktail shaker, it is a measure...
Oh, my goodness!
  Look at that!
  Look at that!
  That is beautiful.
  Cocktail sticks with little finials.
It's got a glass bead on the end that looks like a cherry.
I think it's a bit of fun.
I've sold these novelty cocktail shakers, different shapes and sizes.
Hopefully, we'll get a couple of people who'll be interested.
  How much?
  Yes!
Well! That is the big question. I paid £50.
  Oh, did you?
  Is that shock horror, relief or what?
  It's a sort of, "Right."
  You don't know whether you're surprised or horrified.
What would you say? Does it have a profit?
I would hope so. To be honest, it is a gamble, but it could be...
  Could be a good gamble.
  Well, how interesting, Catherine.
We need a couple of barmen.
A couple of alcoholics in Bridgwater, please!
For the viewers at home, let's find out what the auctioneer thinks about the little cocktail set.
  Well, that's nice, isn't it?
  It's quite sweet.
  A dinky little fellow.
It's a little cocktail measure. You've got your measurements.
Take the top off.
Lo and behold, inside, we have cocktail sticks.
  So I think it's quite fun.
  Yes.
There are collectors of these little items that would quite like this.
  How much, do you think?
  20 to 40.
  Is that all?
£50, Catherine paid.
  Well, I think it is a quirky enough item. It might appeal.
  Very good.
  Are you looking forward to the auction?
  Yes, of course.
  So are we.
  Katie and Clairy, how are you feeling, girls?
  Quite excited. It's our first time at an auction.
  What is your prediction that's going to do really well?
  I still like my ship's lamps.
Well, I like your ship's lamps, I have to say.
The leather clock and hallmarked silver, Clairy, you paid £170.
  Her estimate is £80 to £120.
  Oh, dear.
  Not such a good estimate.
First up are your lamps. Here they come.
Lot 94, rather nice these.
A pair of small Davy pre war ship's port and starboard lamps. Lot 94.
£30? Start me away?
  Go on!
  All right, then, 20? Get it going.
20 I have. 25. Now 30.
No. 25 I've got in the room.
At 25. Now, 30? At 25. Now, 30 anywhere?
I don't like the sound of this.
Are you all done? They're going to sell. 25 it is.
  Those ship's lights have gone out.
  Aren't doing it in Bridgwater.
Hallmarked silver and leather clock.
Birmingham 1903. Pretty little thing this.
What can I say? Start me away. £50 straight in.
  £50 for the little clock?
  Oh, Clairy...!
Thank you. 50 I have. Five.
60. Five. 70.
Five. 80. Five.
  It's going up.
  90. Five.
95 away there. Now 100 anywhere?
At £95, are you all sure? Selling, then, at 95...
I don't like the look of this. 95 is minus 75.
  That takes you to minus one ton!
  We do it in style.
  Here's the fork.
The horn fork with the silver mount, little Scottish one. Lot 96.
Start me away. £10 anywhere for it? £10? Little pickle fork?
£10? £5, surely?
I'm in a bit of a pickle about this.
£5 anywhere? No one going to give it a good home?
I can't keep begging.
No. Sorry. Nobody seems to want the little fork.
Oh! They've passed it! They've passed it!
  Is that a first?
  You're minus 15 on that.
We haven't had a passed lot in the last eight years.
  We get the fork back?
  Yeah. You get the fork back.
  Can I take it home?
You can do what you like with the fork.
Anyway, overall, you are now minus 115. OK?
Which is not so good.
What about that crib you were so rude about?
  We'll give it a go.
  What's happened to Miss Snarky about the crib?
  It can't get much worse, can it?
  Do you know something?
It cannot get much worse.
We're going with the crib at £20.
Lot 100, a Mauchline ware crib with Colwyn Bay on it.
Start me away. What can I say? £20 anywhere?
20? £10, then?
I think we're doomed, aren't we?
Ten I have out in the alcove. Do I see 12 anywhere?
Well, it's going to be ten. £10 it is, then.
Good day this, isn't it?
  Just £10 for that.
  Never mind.
  It's minus £10.
Which is minus 125.
The thing is with this, girls,
  minus 125 could be a winning score, the way things are going.
  Really?
  Yeah. So don't say a dickie bird to those beastly blues.
  My lips are sealed.
  Steve and Joy, do you know what the form is with the reds?
  No.
  No.
You don't know what their score is. That's perfect.
We'll just whisk through your lots. The stick.
She's estimated £60 to £100.
  Oh, dear.
  The sugar tongs with the Isle of Man three footed terminals.
Ten to 15, she's put on those.
So she's not so chuffed about those.
The scoop job, she's estimated 30 to 60.
You paid 55, so it'll be really interesting
to see what the folk of Bridgwater make of this very rare native lump.
  He's talking about me!
  Oh, Joy! Would I call you a native lump?
  I certainly would not.
  I would.
  Steve! 32 years you've been married.
Anyway, here comes the stick.
Walking cane. This is the one carved with the snakes.
I start straight in at £60...
  Good.
  We want a bit more than that.
..At £60 then. It's going to sell...
Oh, no! No, no, no, no!
  Oh, rats!
  Sorry, team. Minus 40.
I had a horrible feeling about that. Now, the sugar tongs.
With the Isle of Man symbols to the ends. Lot 117.
Start me away, £10 anywhere for them?
< Little sugar nips? £10...?
  Oh, dear!
  I don't like the sound of this.
  Neither do I.
..Bid's at five. And eight. And ten.
12? No.
At ten. On my right, then, at £10. Are you all sure? Selling at £10.
  That is minus £20. How can that be for solid silver?
  Absolutely.
  That's a bit unfair.
  This could be a blood bath, this treen.
What can I say for this one please?
£20 to get it away? £20?
  It's going to go very quiet.
< £10? Surely it can be used for something.
It would burn for a long time.
  Oh, come on!
  Yes! Oh, come on!
Anybody want it for £10? £10 I have.
Do I see 12 anywhere? Bid's at ten. On my left at £10. At ten.
Are you all sure and done? It's going to sell at ten.
We can safely assume
that the burghers of Bridgwater don't like native scoops much.
OK. That is 40...85... That is minus 105.
  That's not a great score.
  I thought it was the ones who lost the most.
Yes. That's what we were aiming for. We were playing a different game.
Now, the cocktail measure. Are you going to have a punt?
  Let's go out with a bang.
  Yes. Let's really win with a big loss.
You REALLY don't like my cocktail shaker!
  Seriously, are you going with the Bonus Buy?
  Yes.
  £50 paid.
It is the smartest, chic est, oddest little cocktail shaker in the world.
You're going to take a punt and I don't blame you.
Lot 122 is this rather sweet little 1930s cocktail measure.
£38. At 38. Do I see 40 anywhere? Bid's with me at 38.
At 38. Now 40? 40 in the room. At £40.
Now two anywhere? The bid's in the room. All done? Selling at £40.
  Rats!
  That is not as bad as it might have been. Minus £10.
  Oh, well.
We're keeping up the record. It's minus 115.
  You never know, 115...
  Might be a winning score.
  So don't say a word to the reds.
  No.
  Thank you very much.
  Well, teams, you been chatting?
  No.
Well, there are some direct comparisons between you both today.
  There's hardly a sheet of Bronco between you.
  Really?
But you've not made any profits. You've both made monumental losses.
In fact, not one single item for either team made any money at all.
In fact, both of the Bonus Buys failed to make money.
  Oh, good.
  It's a classic result for Bargain Hunt.
The team that is marginally further behind is...the reds.
Oh! Boo hoo!
Minus 25, minus 75, minus 15, equals minus 115.
You went with the Bonus Buy, which is another tenner off. Minus 125.
  Not too bad, is it?
  No. It's all right!
  Did you have a nice time?
  Yes, thank you.
  I hope you enjoyed it.
You two lost on everything. 40, 25, 45 gave you minus 105.
You went with the Bonus Buy, lost another £10.
You're minus 115.
There's £10 between you, so you can walk tall with the accolade,
It's been a brilliant day. Join us soon for some more bargain hunting.
  Yes?
  Yes!
