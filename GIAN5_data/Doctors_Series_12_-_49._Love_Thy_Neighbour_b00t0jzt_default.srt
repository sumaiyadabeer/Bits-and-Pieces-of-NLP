  Morning!
  Good morning.
Morning.
Karen! Welcome, the prodigal receptionist returns!
  Translation, good to see you back.
  It's good to be back.
And how was the course? Money well spent, I hope.
  You have no idea.
  Indeed, I don't. So a quick precis will suffice.
Well, there were all the procedures.
Measuring height, weight, blood pressure, ECGs.
  Taking blood, I hope?
  Of course.
At which I'm sure you'll be excellent. Won't she, Julia?
  Ooh, yeah.
  I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to this.
One of my better ideas, I think.
  I beg your pardon?
  Training Karen up as a health care assistant.
  Your idea?
  It will certainly solve our staffing problem.
So now, you're taking the credit for my initiative?
The point is, Karen's happy. And a happy staff makes for a productive surgery.
That's true. I couldn't agree more.
You know, maybe there's a lesson to be learnt here.
Maybe we should spend more time talking to the troops,
to discuss their performance, their needs.
There you go, making work for yourself.
More meetings, more paperwork.
Well, maybe YOU could shoulder some of that burden.
Having said that, you are the most competent and thorough practice managers
I have ever had the privilege of working for.
You look tired.
  Rough night.
  Tell me you weren't camped outside again.
Angela...
Why don't you go into the lounge? I'll get a pot brewing.
Look at the dust on those curtains.
I really should do something about that.
What's this?
It's nothing, I found it outside this morning.
I told Michelle we'd meet her at the Icon for a drink tonight.
  Cherry!
  You haven't been out for ages.
  Can we not talk about this here?
  If you won't talk about it at home...
  Not now.
Listen up, guys. Sorry to spring this on you at short notice, but...
  we thought today would be good for personal reviews.
  We?
Well, I...
thought it would. A chance for me to catch up with everyone.
Just think of it as an informal chat.
You know, you can discuss any personal problems, air any grievances.
  In other words, I don't have enough to do today.
  So, who's first?
I can spare you half an hour.
I think we've had more than enough chats, Charlie?
Well, I have patients to see.
Er, Cherry and I were halfway through a supplies inventory.
  Weren't we?
  That's right.
Simon? You and I haven't had much chance to chat.
You know that my door is always open.
Yes, thank you. I should make a start now.
OK. Give me half an hour.
You know, I've put on three pounds in the month I've been here.
I made them last night. Who else is going to eat them?
Sit down for a minute. There's something I wanted to talk to you about.
I thought we might make some changes around here.
  Changes?
  Mm hm. To help you.
  The figurines... You've moved them.
  They were gathering dust.
Like the curtains. It only adds work for you.
  I don't mind.
  Anyway, this place could do with a bit of modernising.
Paint the walls, replace the curtains.
Just something a bit less stuffy.
What do you think?
It's your house. GLASS SMASHES
  That's it. You have to telephone the police!
  No.
At least see a doctor about that monstrous cough.
No arguments this time.
Someone has to look after you.
Not too tight? Is that all right?
So, are you going anywhere nice for your holidays?
You don't have to make small talk, Karen. You're not a hairdresser.
  Actually, it's better if the patient stays quiet.
  Oh, OK.
110 over 70. Congratulations, Miss Malone.
You have perfectly normal blood pressure.
  How was that?
  Impressive.
  Seriously?
  Excellent technique. Great bedside manner. Ten out of ten.
  Hmm...
  You do know there's an unmanned reception desk out there?
  I was, er...
just getting Cherry to put me through my paces while it was quiet.
Well, now it's busy.
Running all the way!
  Sorry.
  No need to ask why I'm here!
  How long have you had it?
About a week. It's been worse these last couple of days.
Any other symptoms?
I've been a bit light headed of late. Probably just a lack of sleep.
Do you think I might have an infection?
We can have a look.
If you could take your scarf and coat off, please.
  Sorry, I got side tracked.
  You OK?
I will be when this court case is over.
Do you want to talk about it? That's what I'm here for.
You remember the Douglas girl?
Oh, yeah, the one that was found dead on the common.
  Didn't they arrest...?
  Ross Keene.
Famously acquitted for the murder of a young girl two years ago at exactly the same spot.
  Did he do it?
  The medical evidence said he did.
That's not the problem.
Keene's family is screaming stitch up. They reckon the police are pinning this on him
because they couldn't make the last one stick. It's a strong defence.
So, that means your evidence...
Needs to be watertight. No pressure, then.
Is there anything I can do to help?
No. I just need to prepare for the onslaught.
So, if you don't mind...
Oh, yeah, right. OK.
Thankfully, you don't have a chest infection.
A nasty cough, yes, but nothing that some over the counter cough medicine won't sort out.
Some prayers wouldn't hurt either.
It looks good on you.
You don't get many of these in a size ten.
Where's your parish?
Sutton Vale. St Yves...
Ah. It's not the most conventional career path for a woman like you.
You mean someone who isn't part of the cosy cardigan brigade?
We're not all like the Vicar of Dibley, you know.
What I mean is, what made you choose the Church?
Same reason you chose medicine.
It's a calling.
The female thing is irrelevant.
Why does everyone get so hung up on that?
I don't know. Do they?
The blue is quite slimming, I suppose.
  I'd prefer something brighter myself.
  You won't be wearing blue. That's just for us nurses.
  It'd confuse the patients.
  Yeah, I can see how that would be a right brain teaser.
Other HCAs in the area wear this...
Why don't you try it on and see if it fits?
  I'm not wearing this.
  I don't think you have much choice.
  It's mauve,
  I'll look like a cleaner!
I hope you managed to sort our new Reverend out.
  How are you, Miss Lombard?
  Bearing up.
It's not been an easy few months.
I'm sorry I couldn't make the funeral.
We gave the late Reverend a lovely send off. He was a very...
  popular figure.
  I'm sure. Apologies, I should...
We should let Doctor Granger get on.
You seem to know him very well.
He was ever so helpful when Reverend Ashton was ill.
  He's a first class doctor.
  He's certainly a charmer.
More importantly, what did he have to say?
It's just a cough, nothing to worry about.
  Did you tell him how you caught that cough?
  I'm fine.
What about the letters?
Or the attacks?
This is MY battle.
Karen, I'm really pleased that the course went so well.
  It was nerve wracking at first, learning new things, but the teachers were great.
  That's good.
I can't wait to be let loose on the veins of Letherbridge.
Seriously, Julia, thanks for the opportunity.
I won't let you down.
Michelle will give you all the support you need.
Bring it on!
Angela, sunflower or fern green?
When were you thinking of redecorating?
No time like the present. Of course, I'd value your opinion.
What are you doing with that?
Yesterday, you nearly tripped over yourself.
I thought I'd take up the hem for you.
You don't have to keep making work for yourself.
Actually, if you don't mind, I'd like to get some new thread.
  I shan't be long.
  Sure, go ahead.
And how are you with Karen taking on this new role?
  I'm fine about it.
  You don't think there'll be a problem with her and Michelle?
No, I think they'll get on like a house on fire.
Good.
So, how are things with Simon?
He's still a bit down about Will. He just needs time.
That's what worries me.
It seems to be taking rather a long time.
  Isn't there something you can do?
  Are you saying I'm not doing enough to help him through it?
  No, not at all.
  Simon's really down. I can't just wave a magic wand.
No one's asking you to.
Anyway, I thought this was supposed to be about me.
Mmm.
You've surpassed yourself. Thank you for the kind gesture.
I'm glad you like them, Doctor.
But you didn't come here to feed me. Is this about Emily?
The truth is,
the Reverend has been the victim of a hate campaign.
We've had bricks through windows, graffiti, even her car's been vandalised.
That's why she's poorly. She's not sleeping properly, and...
last night, she even slept in her car.
Why would she do that?
I think she wanted to confront them.
But that's not all, I'm afraid. Each time, they leave a note.
"Go away. No to women priests."
That kind of thing.
And...
..this.
And how long has all this been going on?
The notes have been constant for a couple of weeks now.
I know Emily needs to put on a show of strength, but I'm worried about her.
  What do the police say?
  She won't report it.
She doesn't want to turn it into an issue.
If that's her decision...
This person isn't going away.
And in the meantime, her health goes downhill.
  What do you want me to do?
  Talk to her.
Convince the Reverend that her health is at serious risk.
If she doesn't take any action,
then who knows what else this...
person is capable of?
I can understand your concern, of course. If she doesn't...
come to me directly and ask for my help,
  I'm afraid I can't get involved.
  Well...
..thank you, anyway.
Did you find your thread?
I had to try a few shops.
  Sorry if I was a while.
  That's OK.
  This can't go on, you know.
If you won't even call the police...
I'm not going to let them win.
  Anyway, no one got hurt.
  That's what it would take, would it?
I did not, you lying beggar!
  I saw you pulling that face!
  What face?
  What is all this?
  All in good time.
  Am I excused now?
  Yes.
I might give Calvin Klein a call.
What's going on here?
I thought I should return this. And since I'm here...
I'm sorry. The Reverend's busy.
  You'll have to come back another time.
  I'll see you next Friday.
We can arrange a firm date for the wedding then.
  Bye. Speak to you soon.
  Bye.
  Did you want to see me?
  If you can spare a minute.
  Maybe you should make Doctor Granger a cup of tea.
  Oh...
This way.
Ladies, for your pleasure, may I present the lovely, the gorgeous...
Karen.
As you can see,
Karen is modelling a rather fetching bottle green tunic,
along with white rim and easy to open buttons.
Perfect for a newly qualified health care assistant.
The colour is reminiscent of the rain forest.
  Or a park ranger!
  Oi!
It's foul.
Move on to something else.
  No. You look like a cleaner.
  Thank you.
Dental hygienist.
No.
  Why?
  Hips.
  Well, it's...
  What?
  A little loud...
but surprisingly fun!
Michelle?
And...the piece de resistance!
God bless...
Sorry about that. One of my housebound parishioners.
  How are you feeling? You look exhausted.
  I'll be fine.
And...redecorating?
  Yeah, I was thinking something a little less 19th century.
  Mm.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Angela's worried about you.
I thought she might do something like this. I'm sorry you've had to come all this way.
You should have confided in me earlier.
This is not your problem.
Not yet. But sleep in that car another night and you're heading for a chest infection.
And what about these attacks? I think you should get the police involved.
If the boss wants me here, I'm sure he'll take care of me.
  What does that mean?
  If I turn the other cheek,
they'll eventually give up and go away.
In the meantime, you're risking your health.
Having talked to Doctor Granger...
I can't believe you bothered the doctor with this.
Yes, she spoke to me about it, and quite rightly mentioned the vandalism and...this.
This is serious, how long can you cope with this level of hostility?
I honestly think a different course of action might be required.
Are you saying I should post for a transfer?
Would that be such a bad thing?
How can you serve your parish if you're under constant threat?
Listen, both of you, I'm not going anywhere.
The Lord didn't give up when the going got tough and neither will I.
What are you after?
  A red pen.
  Hold on...
Thank you.
  OK, what's wrong?
  Nothing.
I guess...after this course, reception feels like a bit of a come down.
I disagree. Both roles are important.
  You've just got to learn to juggle and keep smiling.
  The juggling, I can do. It's the smiling,
what, with Michelle's being a right mardy cow at the moment!
You'll have to stay on the right side of her, especially when it comes to dishing out
  the less salubrious jobs.
  Like what?
Have you ever performed a Van Halen procedure?
A Van... No.
You must have done that on your course.
You tried your best. I'm sorry it was a wasted excursion.
I appreciate both your concerns, but I will handle it my way. Now, let's not say any more about it. Biscuit?
  Actually, they were for...
  I should get back.
We can't let you go without sampling one, can we?
  Take one with you.
  So?
  No disrespect, Julia,
but I'd rather talk to Heston about my clinical assessment, thank you.
OK. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
Not really.
Fine, then I give up.
Why is this so important to you?
It's just basic pastoral care.
  I don't think I'm doing enough.
  Oh. OK.
  Actually, there is something.
  Oh, OK.
  Shoes.
  Shoes?
Designer.
Discounted. I have found the most fabulous new website.
Let me show you.
I picked up the most fantastic pair of Christian Louboutin killer heels.
He was too quick. I'll call the police.
No, I told you...
  I don't want them involved.
  Are you OK?
Angela!
  What happened? Is she all right?
  Get some water. She's been sick.
Of course.
Did you see who it was?
No. They were wearing a hood.
OK, take it easy.
  Better?
  Yeah.
  Can you tell me what you've eaten today?
  A sandwich and...
  that biscuit.
  I've eaten exactly the same...
I feel fine. I said you'd get sick if you slept outside.
I've seen this before.
Julia, if you have a moment, I'd like to propose one or two ideas.
Er... Write them down and stick them in the suggestion box.
And where might that be?
  Hmm?
  Where exactly would you like me to stick my suggestions?
Just...go away.
Angela, what have you done?
It's not just me, there are lots of us in the parish.
We're traditional, not everything that's new
  has to be a good thing, you know.
  You need to tell me...
You were supposed to stop her, make her go away, I don't care where,
just not here!
  Angela!
  You don't belong here.
  How could you?
The apostles were all men, Jesus chose them!
Women should remain silent in church and have no authority over men, that's what
St Paul tells us.
  We are all one in Christ Jesus.
  Thousands of years of tradition,
thousands of years building our church and you come in here with your new broom
and want to sweep it all away! Well, I won't let you, I won't let you!
I'm the woman of this house, not you!
  You need to tell me what's in those biscuits. Now!
  I've been here for years, this is my home.
Angela, focus, OK?
Tell me what you put in the biscuits, please.
You've poisoned Emily.
You need to tell me. Now!
I didn't mean to... Oh!
Ambulance.
  The Rectory, Blenheim Road.
Thallium sulphate ingestion.
..No, I'm a GP...
OK, thank you.
I just...wanted you to go away.
The graffiti, the broken window,
was that all you?
May God forgive you.
He will, won't he? I am a Christian.
Never mind God, why don't you ask Emily for forgiveness?
The ambulance is on its way.
Do you want me to call the police too?
This is assault.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Angela. There have to be consequences... Agh!
..for your actions. Oh!
  I'm going to be arrested?
  Yes.
Oh!
  Yes, police...
  Would you pray with me, Reverend?
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...
  Night, Karen.
  Night, Jimmi.
Good luck tomorrow.
Thanks.
How's life back on the frontline?
Fine. At least here, I know what I'm doing.
Don't get me wrong, I'm excited about the HCA job,
but this is serious stuff.
Yes, it is.
  I might look the part, but what if I can't do the job?
  Says who?
Until now, it's all been theory.
I can stick needles in oranges until the cows come home, but for real...
It's exactly the same.
What if I can't do it?
I've made all this fuss.
I'm just going to make a right prat of myself.
Well, I can safely say that my little chats were a resounding success.
  Excellent!
  No, Heston, not excellent, they were a disaster.
  Oh, surely they weren't all...
  I couldn't get hold of Simon.
I upset Cherry, Jimmi's tied up in this court case,
and I had a very informative chat with Zara about shoes. HESTON LAUGHS
  Sorry.
  I'm not laughing, Heston!
And to top it all, Charlie's been badgering me all day about where to stick his useless suggestions!
  It didn't go to plan?
  Not my best day.
Oh, well, onwards and upwards!
Nothing a large glass of Brunello di Montalcino won't fix.
Got to dash, Julia.
Thanks for your... LINE GOES DEAD
Hello?
It just takes practice.
  I know.
  Daniel can do it and he's an idiot.
I know. It's all in my head.
You'll be fine. I'll help.
Come here, you're such a lovely man.
Karen, I can't breathe!
What have I told you about bothering Mummy
  when she's on the phone?
  Don't shout at her.
  I say the same thing
  over and over again with this child!
  The only way to know you're here now
  is to check the rota.
  Some of us come to work to actually work.
So, what am I practising on? Please don't tell me it's another orange!
  Do I look ill to you?
  Um...
Then maybe you should examine my husband.
