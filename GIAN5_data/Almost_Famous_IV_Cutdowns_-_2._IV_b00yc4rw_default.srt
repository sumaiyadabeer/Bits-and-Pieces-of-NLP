What a crazy year! We've had the big freeze,
the very little effort, and the massive sized iPhone
that you can't make calls on, just use to check your e mails on the toilet.
and hello to two well educated young men now running the country.
Ah, if only! When we've not been saving Chilean miners,
we've been saving our pennies, because as the year draws to a close
it seems the only people making any money are the bankers  
people like him. Look at them all there!
Definitely bankers. If only there was another way to pay the bills!
Well, maybe there is.
Get a job as a celebrity! With the right   well, any   qualifications,
you too can be flouncing up red carpets and quaffing champagne.
in the world of show biz. So sit back, put your posh frock on
and get yourself on Twitter, because this time next week
you'll be getting papped inside Asda.
So this is our first tip to get your foot on the glittering ladder
of celebrity   stand out from the crowd.
Go on, show off a little. And where better to begin
than with Tyneside royalty and celebrity extraordinaire, Cheryl Cole?
Here she is aged seven, modelling kids' clothes
at a shopping centre. As you can see, she's not alone.
So how does she elevate herself above the competition?
By throwing in a little funny walk. The other girl's got no comeback! But everyone seems to like it.
We said we weren't going to do that dance, didn't we?
Except him. He sounded well annoyed. But that won't stop wor Cheryl from working the crowd!
The colours in this story are going to wow you.
on your bicycle, you want to be noticed.
Oh, there'll be no stopping her now. Hang on   riding a bike,
dressed like that? Is he having a laugh?
Anyway, what does our Cheryl do next?
That's it   she throws in a funny face to complement the funny walk.
That's textbook, Cole, textbook.
Well done, girls!
  How old are you, Cher?
Before the X Factor, Cheryl Cole wannabe Cher Lloyd
began climbing the celebrity ladder by entering her local newspaper's talent competition.
Unfortunately it was at such an early stage in her career
that she hadn't quite mastered the art of singing in proper sentences.
You're a song
Written by the hands of God
  Don't get me for...
  You what?
This might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the pla ace...
Ah, bl bless!
So as we can see, one way to appear truly unique and original
is to enter a talent show. Once there,
you can turn the star quality up and get rid of the competition.
She's only 14, and she comes from Anstruther in Fife. She looks good,
she sings well, she moves well. She's singing Venus.
She's Edith Bowman! AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS
Before Edith was spinning records on the radio,
she was murdering them on this Scottish talent show.
  A goddess on a mountain top...
  Hang on. Did he say 14?
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it...
She has got it, all right. But you can get pills for that now,
and it clears up in no time at all.
I'm your fire at your desire
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
Blimey, I hope that's not catching.
I ain't gonna do you wrong while you're gone...
Oh, look, it's little Justin Bieber   everyone's favourite Justin,
apart from my mate Justin, who's loads better than him. He's really nice.
A little respect when you get home...
Anyway, here's Justin demanding our respect
whilst wearing clothes three sizes too big for him.
  Miming a sax. Priceless!
Or has he just got a nasty case of Bieber fever?
Apparently that can affect your coordination.
Yeah, he's definitely got it. Which reminds me...
  Oh, no!
Oh, it is much worse than I thought, this.
If you do know someone who has got Bieber fever,
don't go near them, and burn their clothes to stop it spreading.
  It's the only way.
  She's got it
  Justin Timberlake!
  Clap your hands!
Here's another Justin now. This one's at a talent show in Memphis.
I hope he's OK.
Well, she's my Lady Luck, hey, I'm her wild card man
Together we're building up a real hot hand
We live out in the country and she's my little queen...
He's definitely got something, but has he got "it"?
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up...
Oh! Yeah, he has, actually.
Like the crops need the rain
And we're two of a kind...
Country and western, fancy dancing and a Newcastle United top.
That's a hat trick!
Oh, no. That's a hat trick. That's... Oh, forget it.
This time I found a keeper
Let's see if Edith's got a prescription yet.
I've got it
Oh, that's a relief. Are you sure she's only 14?
Enid, just 14 years old. No wonder her father's tearing his hair out.
That lot might not have had The X Factor, but if you're young,
all you really need is the "ahh" factor.
Is there anything more relaxing than a rubber duck and a hot bath?
Dannii Minogue's even got a song about it!
  Rubber ducky, you're the one...
  Whoa! Where did she pop up from?
You don't need surprises like that when   Whoa, there's another one!
Rubber ducky, I'm awfully fond of you
Rubba dubba ducky...
What the duck is that up there? That's like the duck version
of that rabbit in Donnie Darko.
Rubber ducky, I'm awfully fond of you
From this day forward, Dannii was too frightened to ever bath again.
  She's showered ever since.
It's on the radio.
On the other hand, Naomi loves sharing a bath
almost as much as she loves a tantrum.
  Have you met Janet and April?
  Hello.
  Do you wet your bed?
  Not every night.
  I do!
  Oh, that's not true!
  There's a special word for that. Did you know that?
  "Incontinence"?
  "Nitwit".
  Yeah, she's laughing now, but moments later,
Naomi threw a loofah at that woman's head.
Is this your daughter? Is this Miley?
Here's a very young Miley Cyrus being urged to show off her talent
by her father, Billy "Achy Breaky Heart" Cyrus.
  Let's look at Daddy.
  Hey, Miley, look in the camera.
Do your eyes one time. Do your eyes, Miley.
If my dad had that haircut, I'd be doing that face all the time.
Do your eyes! AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND APPLAUDS
Smells good!
Ahh, Hogwarts! Oh, no. I think that's Dover.
Go away! No boys here!
But that is young Daniel Radcliffe, before he held aloft his famous wand
in that nudie play he did. I think it was about a horse.
If you please, ma'am...
If you please, Aunt,
I am your nephew, David Copperfield.
Oh!
  Ooh!
  I've been very unhappy since Mama died,
  and my stepfather hates me.
  All right. Nobody likes a moaner.
But "ahh" factor aside, there's still one adage that always counts.
Most people don't know this, but Tiger Woods started out as a ventriloquist's dummy.
And he's an accomplished golfer. He wins tournaments regularly.
That guy's rubbish. I can see his lips moving!
Incredibly, Tiger here is only five years old.
  Tiger's no dummy...
  "Gottle o' geer."
  ..so he took up golf instead.
  He's five years old.
Tiger Woods!
Not only was this his first televised round of golf,
it was also the first time he reversed a golf buggy into a fire hydrant.
When I'm 20, I'm going to beat Jack Nicklaus.
Jack Nicholson? He's not even a professional golf player.
But if you're not blessed with real talent, there is another option.
And where better to do it than in the gladiatorial arena?
This one was in Birmingham, just off the M6. It's signposted.
Let's meet the guys. Tonight, Alex Reid...
Before he was Jordan's fella, Alex Reid was a person in his own right.
But in those days, he sometimes went under another name.
  Welcome to Gladiators, Alexander the Great.
  Of course!
Yes, that's what she said. And coming up now is a master class
  in bigging yourself up.
  I understand you're a bit of a star.
  Go and watch Sliding Doors.
  Can we see you in that?
  You certainly can.
  Really? Whereabouts?
In the bar, in the restaurant. Quite a big scene!
Quite a big scene, you say...
There's a waiter with a pineapple. That can't be him.
There's that waiter again. Is that him? Oh!
  I wonder what Gwyneth's saying?
  Me and Gwyneth are like that.
  Yeah. And then you wake up, right?
  No, really.
"What are you called on Gladiators again?"
Alexander the Great will seal your fate.
  His power will make you second rate.
  Whoo!
That is pretty impressive. He's bound to win now.
Alex powers up the Travelator. Magnificent contender!
Tops the hill from hell and finishes it off!
Yeah! Second.
Alexander the Great didn't conquer tonight, but I'm still happy.
How much have you enjoyed the whole Gladiator experience?
  I've just got one word to say. "Top banana"!
  That's two.
You've either got it or you haven't, and if you have,
then, flaunt it.
Babes! This is more like it. Ooh, I don't think much of her.
Hello and welcome to a brand new show, Babes.
It's not just a beauty contest. And our final contestant is Cat!
Oh, that makes more sense.
From that look, we can tell that Cat's got the claws out tonight!
We know you've got your claws out for Elliot,
but who would you really like to get your claws into?
  Reasonable question.
  I'd like to run my nails down someone's back,
  but I don't think it's yours.
  Well, that's him told.
Tough luck!
  They're all drop dead gorgeous, but we're going for Kimberley.
  Oh!
Cat Deeley lost the battle, but I think she won the war,
or the "phwoar", as they probably say on Babes... Oh, forget it!
Now that I broke it down for you, Matt will run it from the top.
Ready, Matt?
Here's Glee's Matthew Morrison strutting his stuff
  in this instructional dance video.
  Kick it! Huh, huh. Good.
FAST PACED DRUM MUSIC Kick it.
One more. Again.
Whoo!
Well, he's all right, but he's no Louie Spence, is he?
Louie's got charm, humour, grace... Whoa! Tiny red pants!
Squeeze it, Pats. Three. Four.
So many questions. Why is Louie doing a workout with Bianca?
Where's Ricky? And can those pants get any smaller?
Oh, yes, they can. I should've kept my mouth shut.
And one, two, three.
Four, five, six.
I didn't know there WERE smaller pants.
Oh, it's happened again!
Bit close to the edge there!
Two steps back, Louie!
I was only joking!
And here's Matthew Morrison's street interpretation
of the Louie Spence Pant Dance.
And four, five and six. Ahead, and eight.
Please welcome Dominic Littlewood!
Even in this early TV appearance, Dominic wasn't shy
about flaunting it.
  Good to see you.
  Your other half, the one you're trying to find,
  has a nickname for him, which is...
  Donkey Dom.
Because you're stubborn, or is there another reason?
There's another reason.
When my other half goes out with the girls clubbing,
  she wears as little as possible.
  What, less than Louie? Surely not.
  She flirts with all the fellas...
  What, more than Louie?
  ..dances outrageously.
  Show me what she does.
This is how she dances, Dale. RAUNCHY MUSIC PLAYS
My God!
  You loved every minute of that!
  I hated it.
  You are such a show off!
Talking of which, how's Louie getting on?
We're going to do some bums. We're going to lift our hips up.
We're going to squeeze.
Oh, now, that is just... That's quite hypnotic, actually.
Five, six, seven, eight.
We're going to open and close the legs.
One, two. Keep the hips lifted. Four.
Quite fancy an apple all of a sudden. Maybe a Cox's Pippin?
  Leave the legs together and push.
  Oh, this is a killer!
But it's good.
Let's move on to our next tip from the modern day career manual
of star making tips. Oh, dear. It's a simple one.
  Now, somewhere on this stage
is One Show presenter Alex Jones. There she is, with the hair,
I think.
  I wish that kid would stop coughing.
Thank you!
This is like a Where's Wally picture,
but with Christine Bleakley. She's here somewhere.
She's in a white shirt and a tie, so we should be able to spot her.
She's there, above the blonde one. I think that's her, anyway.
Stop zooming out! You're creating more of them!
Before she was Paloma Faith, she was salsa queen Paloma Blomfield.
  My name's Paloma Blomfield.
  That's her real name!
Do you want the truth, or something beautiful?
Once you're on and you start moving, it starts coming naturally.
It's almost like animals when they show off to each other.
  I like that aspect to it.
  I don't like to show off,
but I do a pretty mean salsa myself. Then I did some tortillas in it.
Lovely!
  Oh, it's Alex Jones again.
She took up the violin to get away from that kid having coughing fits.
Sadly he took up the trumpet, so there was no escape.
  Oh...
I see someone laid some flowers on the stage
so we can all remember this poor, dead song.
Ah, beautiful! But to really make a name for yourself,
you got to do more than just play a violin badly.
If you want to be a star, you've got to act the part.
Kara Tointon was terrible at washing clothes.
The colours ran, and her favourite top shrunk in the wash.
That's that, then! I hope she's got something else to wear,
cos there's not much else she can do.
  Is this really worth making a programme about?
  What can she do?
  Get a new top?
  What's the problem? Tight is cool.
She should stop being tight and just buy a new top!
Excuse me? This top's shrunk.
She keeps a bag full of smug looks for situations like these.
I washed it at 40 degrees, as the instructions say.
And I think you'll find I'm entitled to my money back,
And that thing with the hair and the pointy teeth is Jack Whitehall.
  Not that one. That one!
  His name's Cyril.
  He's a menace!
No, he's not! He's a rabbit!
If you don't give me that ball...
If there was ever an award for the most cockney child,
Sid Owen would have a mantelpiece full of engraved jellied eels.
  That's my ball!
  No, it ain't!
  Yes, it is!
  You bust yours!
  No, I didn't!
  That's my ball!
I'll have it in a minute! Now, shut up!
I want to go to the toilet!
As a child, Kimberley Walsh put the "loud" into Girls Aloud.
'I'm going to put Mummy into the dustbin.
'And Daddy in the dustbin, Steve in the dustbin,
'Jamie in the dustbin, Jessica in the dustbin!'
Danny in the dustbin... Isn't that just a list of members of Hear'Say?
Let it go! They won Popstars, but you did so much better.
'And then I'm going to play all on my own!'
  But even if you are bursting for the toilet...
  I'm finished!
..there's one piece of advice you ignore at your peril.
That's good.
That's the best Irish coffee you'll taste this side of Wicklow.
What's this? Is it an ad for some fancy perfume?
Oh, no   it's an arty film with Scott Maslen
  about love, romance...
  Oh, and diarrhoea.
  Excuse me, please.
'I couldn't believe it!'
HE GASPS Oh, man, that's raw!
What's he eaten   a Rubik's cube?
HE GASPS Why now?
If that clip put you off your tea, this next one will put you off fish and chips for life.
Viewers with a prudish disposition, and Alex Jones, look away now.
Looking mouth watering already
is the unfeasibly curvaceous Alex Jones from Wales.
  Are you worried about this game?
  Just slightly.
I think my bikini might come off.
It's flattened down your Welsh assets, hasn't it?
  Well, just a bit.
  Makes a change for you!
It's Phil into the water, with great gusto.
The idea is pretty simple. Alex is a fish,
but with clingfilm instead of scales,
so the young men have to fish her out, skin her,
roll her in egg, batter her, then put her on a table
with some big firm chips and giant peas. We've all done it!
Please be careful with Alex's bikini. Please!
Thank heavens, both girls come away de scaled but unscathed.
And any scrap of dignity they've managed to cling on to quickly goes
as they're rolled around in the first of the trays, which is egg.
Very different carrying techniques get the girls into the flour,
where they must receive a generous all over coating.
Kelly's the first out of the batter, and now Alex.
And England are right on their heels!
  The girls look more like mermaids.
  It's in this moment,
when the boys are stuffing their pockets with foam peas,
that Alex realised she needed a change of career. She also had egg in her pants.
I can smell the egg. It's disgusting!
Yes, so can I. How do you think she shapes up as a piece of fish?
I think she's well battered.
We'll add the laugh on later. NARRATOR LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY
Dressing up as a giant Welsh fish isn't for everyone. No, seriously,
it isn't. It's not all about how you look.
It's time to make all the right noises.
  Welcome to the Fun Song Factory!
  Have you just got up, Ozzy?
Aston, the back flipping king of JLS,
used to work in a factory for a big bear.
Polly, put the kettle on
Polly, put the kettle on...
He made tea!
We'll all have tea
Cookie, take it off again...
He got told off for making tea.
Cookie, take it off again
They've all gone away
  And he had a great day.
  I've had a great day today!
  That's good, Cookie!
  Very easily pleased in those days.
  Really?
  Before Xtra Factor, Konnie Huq worked in a meat market...
Roll up, roll up
Come along to Smithfield
..with a young Jude Law
and a room full of ridiculous cockney stereotypes.
This lot even turned the young Sid Owen away.
  No, it ain't!
  Yes, it is! You bust yours!
  No, I didn't!
Here's Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden
teaching other kids how to sing. This is bound to be good!
THEY ALL SING IN HARMONY The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music...
She owns that stage.
My heart wants to sing every song
  It hears
  Every song it hears...
She's made that song her own.
Oh, Amanda, you're just what this show needs.
I go to the hills
But if you are lucky enough to be blessed with the voice of an angel,
it's better to be seen and not heard,
so this is our next tip   get yourself noticed.
Remember Timmy Mallett? Course you don't! You're only 17.
But look who's sitting behind that turntable like a ginger Harry Potter!
It's Chris Evans! Look!
Remember The Bill? Oh, come on. It only finished a few months ago.
Well, look who's right at the back of this shot. It's James Corden!
There he is! Oh, he's gone again.
No, no, no. He's back again.
Alex Reid would call this being a male lead.
  I've just got one word to say   "top banana"!
  That's two.
Oh, now that copper's blocking him. He's probably taking his shirt off
and slapping his belly, if I know Corden.
Swatch set up a UK collectors' club last year.
Somewhere among these keen Swatch collectors is Welly Lollough...
Lelly... Her off This Morning. You know the one I mean.
There she is. Holly, probably Willoughby, about 13 in this clip.
I like it. It's different.
Is there a doctor in the house? No, but there's one in this boat.
Rowing four, Hugh Laurie...
You see what I did there? Because he's Dr House... Forget it.
This is Mad Lizzie. She got her name after she ate 45 boiled eggs
in one sitting. But behind her is Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood.
And this is a first, because, if you watch carefully, he smiles.
I know! Smiles!
Craig, of course, went on to judge other people dancing. Hmm!
This leads us nicely on to our next tip.
That's terrible!
Here's a young David Tennant in this '80s anti smoking video,
with his hands in his pockets. Then out of his pockets.
Then back in his pockets. He's time travelled his way
around the continuity department. On me head, son!
Oh.
After football, young David loves nothing more than a cigarette.
If it's good enough for Rooney, it's good enough for Dr Who.
I hope that's not your last. I'm dying for one.
No, I've got plenty. Take one.
Don't be miserable. Give your friend one!
  She doesn't want one.
  What's wrong with you?
Our cigarettes not good enough or something?
It's nothing to do with that. I don't smoke.
But as this unpopular, badly dressed girl no one wants to talk to proves,
  smoking is for losers.
  Please yourself!
  Right, guys?
  Come on!
  Aye, just a minute!
Well, I'm away now. See you later, OK?
So smoking's not clever or glamorous.
Which leads to our next career tip  
always present yourself well.
Oh, no! It's Alex Jones again.
The last time she lay down in the sun
she was covered in egg and foam chips, so she's come a long way.
  This is a kind of travel show, dating thing.
  .."cop off."
One of them is going to cop off with someone.
  ..Hawaii 5 0!
  I'll level with you.
When Alex is wearing a bikini, I don't really concentrate
on anything that's not Alex Jones in a bikini.
I've only just realised they're speaking Welsh!
  Dara O'Briain with hair,
talking Gaelic and...
  Did he just say... Hang on.
  He said it again!
It's a bit better, but it means the same thing, potty mouth!
I'm not sure, but I think this is Welsh too,
and that is Penelope Cruz in the eye patch.
One thing I am sure of is, that boat will never make it out of harbour,
even with that flag.
Quinta Marcha!
We'll hear loads more from Mother Goose during the show.
Oh, here's old potty mouth again. And I've seen that duck before!
Rubber ducky, I'm awfully fond...
Stuff of nightmares!
Today in the Shack, the guest is the President of Ireland,
Uachtarain Mary McAleese. If you'd like to talk to her,
  give us call on...
Hello. Is that the President of Ireland?
I'd like to make a complaint about Dara's language in the earlier clip.
Well, there's no need for that! Oh, they're all at it!
After all that, the most important thing
is to hit the right note. Oh, forget it!
  Hey, guys! What's up?
Now, who's this?
I'll give you three... Oh, you've already got it.
Yes, it's Lady Gaga before the hair, the costumes
and, indeed, before she'd written any songs.
  Do you guys like reggae?
"Anybody just like chatting about stuff? I haven't written any songs."
  You like Led Zeppelin?
  Yeah!
  This dude does.
This is Katy Hudson before she became Katy Perry
and then Katy Brand   not that one, the other one  
howling like she's just trod on a plug.
I struggle with fear a lot, because...
I kind of let myself struggle with fear,
and I found out this whole dramatic situation
where I was feeling, "If I don't get my little feet and my little hands
"and some courage, something will bite them off."
I don't know if you've ever had that feeling, but...
I bet old Russell would bitey witey your feety weety
if you left them dangling out the bed.
You don't have to do all that stuff so God can come to you.
He'll meet you later   honestly.
Katy used to be part of the God squad
before she started kissing girls and liking it.
A very similar thing happened to me, actually.
Here's 13 year old Leona Lewis, dressed like a comedy Frenchman
or a burglar, stealing the show with her lovely voice.
Did you see what I did then?
Don't you hate it when you get cramp in your microphone finger?
You've just got to shake it off, haven't you?
I believe
That the heart does go on...
Yes, I voted for her to win, and I want to marry her. What of it?
If you've tried all our tips and still can't see a way in,
hug a tree, become a vegan and wear shoes made of straw.
Yes, if all else fails, go green!
What Please Save Us The World means to me
is that, with one song, not only can grown up people change the world,
but so can an 11 year old kid.
Jennifer wants to save the world, and her career,
with this little ditty.
We are young
But our voices must be heard
The time has come
To hear the children of the world
And all that we are asking for
Is air that we can breathe
An ocean safe to swim in
And a forest that still has trees
Won't you please
Save us the world
Please
Save us the world...
Please stop us the song!
Time is running out
For kids like me.
It's supposed to be about saving the planet, not you!
The message here is clear.
If you want to save precocious little stage school kids,
always, always recycle.
So what lessons have we learned to get you through the interview
and onto the front pages of the glossies?
  Do whatever it takes to get noticed.
  Hey, Miley, do your eyes!
Don't be afraid to big yourself up. Throw in a few tricks.
  Always keep it clean.
  And above all, never act desperate.
  Oh, man, that's raw!
But before you employ someone to remove all your blue M&M's
and run a pure mineral water bath, make sure you know the rules.
  Cheryl will dance however she wants.
  We said we weren't going to do that!
  Sid Owen will always be a cockney...
  That's my ball!
  No, it ain't!
Aston Merrygold makes a cracking cup of tea.
But above all, if you do something embarrassing,
you can bury it, and no one will ever find it until years later,
unless you get really famous, and then we'll use it as inspiration
for future stars like you now, sat there in your pants and socks.
  I think she's well battered.
  So sing it,
shake it and let everyone know what you want.
I want to go to the toilet!
  One day you'll rise to the top of your game.
  Top banana!
Someone will spot your star quality and say you've got it.
I've got it.
To play us out, here's Dannii Minogue again,
with the Aussie Stig and what looks like Louis Walsh in a costume.
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Roger, kiss me...
Oh, it is Louis. He's saying he definitely thinks that maybe...
"Simon, what do you think? Because I think what you think. That's what I think."
That's it from me. Good luck on the slippery ladder of fame,
and I'll see you on the cover of Nuts in your best underwear.
Good night.
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Roger, kiss me
In other words
Please be true
In other words
I love you!
