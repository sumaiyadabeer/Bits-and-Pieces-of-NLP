She passed the water test, mate, she's not a sea ghost.
Tai, the ghosts have gone, it's been weeks.
The lagoon is finally running clear. You whipped Ragnar's butt.
I did, didn't I?
Chloe, this is Natasha.
She's spending the summer here as my lab assistant.
  Do you want to go diving tomorrow?
  Can I see the device?
We check it every day, make sure the green light's on.
That means it's doing its job.
My ghost form's returning. There's nothing I can do to stop it.
  Yuck!
  Want some?
No.
Hi, Dad.
What's that?
A whole lot of trouble.
  The device is broken, the pollution's back.
  How?
Well, looking at this, I'd say the pressure became too great.
A crack appeared in the casing and, Wham, the whole thing blew apart.
But you'll build another one, right?
ASAP. Natasha, there's a map on my desk, which shows where the rift is.
  Can you set up a centrifuge and then collect a pollution sample?
  Sure.
We'll need to test the toxin levels.
And now to tell Victoria.
If the pollution's back, are the sea ghosts back?
Worse. Is Ragnar back?
OK, Tai, focus.
Hard as you can.
And...go!
Natasha, sorry!
No, no, don't worry, it was completely inadvertent.
  What are you doing?
  Just testing the deck to make sure it's waterproof.
Yep, looking good.
The centrifuge isn't working.
  Have you seen your dad?
  The hotel.
OK, another go.
And...focus.
Stop!
Yeah, Tai.
See that? It froze until you were out of the way.
I think it did.
That's great, but remember, now the seal's broken, anything can happen.
  We have to be ready.
  The seal's broken?
You tell him. I'm going for a dive. Check things out.
Hey.
  What did you mean just then?
  Sorry, I've got to go.
The pollution's back?
But that means...
Maybe Ragnar, maybe sea ghosts.
No, not today.
Annual inspection.
The hotel AND the cafe, and there's a new guy doing it.
"Will require higher standards of
"cleanliness, hygiene and presentation."
And if we don't shape up, he could shut this place down.
Man, this things sucks.
And not in a good way.
  Mate, can you stop messing with the power?
  I'm not.
Oh, no!
We've got company.
  Argh!
  Argh!
Morning.
What do you want? Did Ragnar send you?
Ragnar?
Ugly guy, creepy skin,
lives underwater with the paranormal powers?
No, no, Ragnar's been vanquished, imprisoned in the coral.
He doesn't control us any more.
No Ragnar, that's good.
But still ghosts, that's bad.
Fascinating. A simple grinding device improved by
the addition of an electric motor. But I could improve it further.
No, no, no, don't touch anything.
That inspector could walk in any time.
I can't buy a new one of these, there's no more money.
It's the only thing that'll stop the pollution, and look,
the locking mechanism on the actuator has been ripped away.
Do you know what else is going to be ripped away?
My hotel if I fail this inspection.
So why don't you go and...fix the device?
Right, fix the device.
Good idea.
Got to think of a way to fix this device.
Hey, Dad, is there anything I can get you?
  Maybe to take away?
  The electrical components.
Electrical?
Who was that?
Me. I said I wish I could help.
Sorry. Frog in the throat.
Anyway, look,
why don't you take this on the house and go to that spot on the beach?
You know, the one that helps you think?
It might, you know, help you think.
Great idea.
Thanks, Robbo.
Yeah, thanks, Robbo.
Listen, I've got
an inspector coming today, so unless you're here to help...
What if I said I could make this do twice the work in half the time?
  Really?
  Applied electricity is my field.
Harnessing electric power for maximum good.
What about maximum suck?
Leave it to me.
I give up. This thing is a useless.
Fine, Abi, just give up.
We'll fail the inspection, they'll close the hotel, we'll
have nowhere to live, we'll have no money, we'll be out on the street.
Brilliant.
You sure you know what you're doing?
Recalibrating the impeller. Don't worry,
I pioneered vacuum technology...
in my weekends.
  And during the week?
  I worked on my long distance communication device.
It's still unfinished, but...
That would be the reverse switch.
You sure he knows what he's doing?
Hey, man, he's pretty switched on.
That was a joke.
Oh!
When's that inspector coming?
Some time before midday.
It's ten o'clock. We need a back up plan.
You are in breach of section 42B of the food safety regulations,
which means your licence is cancelled immediately.
Can you use your powers to keep the inspector a way?
  Keep him away how?
  Flood the road from the village or something.
It's so hot.
Must be some kind of heat wave, surely.
Even my feet are sweating.
My feet never sweat.
No, I don't feel anything.
Now,
the new induction loop should act as a multiplier effect on net suction.
Awesome!
Try with that orange.
Thanks, this is great!
You're welcome.
Yeah, that inspector can bring it, we'll be so ready.
  Need any help?
  Can you repair an electric centrifuge?
Almost certainly.
What does it do?
Well, you put the polluted water in then turn it on.
It spins the water out and leaves the pollution sediment behind.
It spins?
Well, I could fix it and make it go faster.
He's a local fix it guy.
  I wouldn't trust him.
  Alternating or direct current?
Alternating. I was checking the stator.
  No, the problem's the rotor.
  Do you need a screwdriver?
I really don't think we should...
Before, on the deck, I heard what you said.
There's something extraordinary about that coral rift, isn't there?
Wait, is that my hairdryer?
Ah, yes, that's what it is,
it's for drying hair.
I just need to borrow it.
You can use mine if you want, Megan, just let him get on with this.
  Look, he's...!
  Like you said,
your dad needs the centrifuge fixed expeditiously.
Quickly. So just give him some space to work. Go on.
See you.
Robbo, the ghosts are back. There's one upstairs with
  Natasha.
  It's all cool, he's helping us.
Ghosts don't help, they cause trouble, they come from Ragnar.
No, no, Chloe was right, Ragnar's finished. Kaput.
I mean, this fix it ghost is a real whizz.
If the inspector turns up whilst I'm gone, we're sorted.
What inspector? What inspector?
The new guy, he's coming to renew our cafe licence.
With a ghost hanging around? Where are you going?
Abi's, to drop this off.
They're being inspected too. Shouldn't be long. Bye.
Cutlery clean, check.
Shower scrubbed, check.
Ah!
Argh! Argh!
Argh!
Oh, no, no, no!
No!
Gloria, I've just got to...
  Oh...
  Oh!
  Ooh.
But you're stealing bits of everything.
What do you want them for?
To improve the lot of mankind.
Excuse me.
Robbo!
How's the rotating device going?
It isn't yet.
I'm just checking to see how Mr P likes his sampling done,
then I'll go get some water to test.
Electricity can do such wonders.
And not just with this.
It's going to change the way we communicate.
You wait and see.
  Has the inspector been yet?
  No.
  It's past 12,
maybe Tai did the job and delayed it?
Maybe the Sea Bor...
See ya, see ya, babe.
See you, babe.
Robbo, do you know what this ghost is doing?
Yeah, he's helping.
Oh, yeah, this is really helping.
Hey, Prof, what is this?
My great invention. Everything I ever did has led to this.
Wireless long distance communication using high decibel Morse code.
One day, every household will have one.
Vital information will be exchanged, disasters will be averted.
Distance is no longer a problem, you see, you just make the sound louder.
Wooh! Ha ha! Very good.
Oh, thank you.
First day on the job.
Didn't think to bring water.
Don't get these temperatures in England.
Running late. You understand your generosity will
have no bearing on my decision to close down your premises?
Good. Oh, the heat!
At least the inspector isn't here yet so things could be worse.
OK... So things couldn't be any worse.
Oh, look at the time. This place is a disaster area.
  Mum...
  Let's get all this mess hidden away before the inspector comes.
  Mum...
  Hopefully we can pull the wool over his eyes.
These petty bureaucrats aren't known for their brain power!
  Good afternoon.
Hello!
Apologies for my lateness and my appearance.
Still finding my way around.
Had some mishaps, strange occurrences.
The heat! It's just so...
I've heard that it does things to you, plays with the mind.
And that noise!
Oh, oh, I am so sorry.
Oh, no, this will not do.
Temporary licence.
I am removing one of your stars from your rating.
And the only reason I'm not shutting you down right now
is your previous perfect record.
Now, if you want your star back, you're going to have to work for it.
I'm in no mood to be lenient.
  That noise isn't from here, is it?
  No, no, no, no!
Because that would have closed you down quick smart.
Paradise Cafe?
One more place left.
They'd better be on their toes.
So this morning on the deck, I heard
Megan say cos the seal's broken you guys have to be ready for anything.
What did she mean?
What is that?
I'm not sure.
Natasha!
Oh! Oh!
Sorry! Sorry!
Not as sorry as I am.
I've been overheated, spilled on, splattered on, splashed on.
I'm not cut out for these tropical climes.
South Gloucestershire is looking pretty good right now.
Rain, snow, cold feet in winter...
And in summer.
  I'll be back.
  Sorry?
  For the inspection.
I'll be back. Not today, another day.
  Are you all right?
  No.
I'm going to the doctor's. They have air conditioning at the doctor's.
I'll see you again. Or not.
Glorious air conditioning!
Spilled on and splashed on.
Tai, you rock.
Now to get rid of this ghost.
I should have tried that.
What happened?
Look, the thing is, this
anywhere any time long distance communication thingy...
It'll change the world.
I think someone's beaten you to it.
'Hello, Island Taxis?'
'Hello?'
Astounding. Who has one of these?
  Everyone.
  'Who is this?'
Sorry, wrong number. Bye.
So much better than my invention.
  I've failed again.
  Again?
First I tried electric cables under the sea.
But that didn't work out so well.
So I thought, still use electricity but go wireless.
Now I find the job's been done.
Ah, well. Time to go then. Bye.
No, there must be something I can do, something
I can improve with electricity.
We haven't had our licence renewed yet.
The inspector's coming back any day.
This ghost has to go.
There is something you can improve. Socks.
We can never keep our feet really warm back home.
I mean, woolly socks are OK
but electric socks would have been awesome.
Electric socks, you say.
It's the little things that make the biggest difference.
  Yeah, but not here, it's way too tropical.
  No, you're right.
I need to do this in colder climes.
Finally, I can contribute with something that
no one else has ever thought of.
Electric heating coil, inductive capacity, the battery supply...
Wait a minute,
forget about electric socks.
What say I made an electric blanket? Yes!
London town, here I come!
What, another inspection?
But not today.
And we'll be ready. The main thing is he didn't shut us down.
  And it's all thanks to the Sea B...
  Natasha!
Hey, guys.
That noise has stopped, what was it?
  Fire brigade.
  Car horn got stuck.
  Tsunami warning.
  False alarm.
  False...
  Alarm.
Wow, anything could happen round here, right?
See you later.
She was asking me earlier about what happened on the deck.
  She was asking me too.
  She'll know we're keeping secrets.
We have to. If she ever found out
about the sea ghosts or that you were the Sea Born...
She would have her story. She'll tell the world.
Eurgh!
Oh...
Hey, hey, hey, look on the bright side, she didn't find out.
And the ghost... OK, a bit weird, but no harm done, eh?
  Cheers.
  Cheers.
  Cheers.
Aarghhh!
I am the fearsome pirate, Tiger Lily.
You know about that? Who told Natasha about the Sea Ghosts.
  She doesn't know.
  She can't know.
