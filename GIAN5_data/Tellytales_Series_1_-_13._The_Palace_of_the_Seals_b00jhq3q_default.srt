Let's go!
That looks heavy.
Wow!
I like that!
  This tale is called...
  The Palace Of The Seals.
Once upon a time, in Scotland, there lived a fisherman.
  His name was Ronan.
  Hello, Ronan!
The sea looks choppy.
Ronan was famous for being the best fisherman in the land.
Oh, what a lot of fish!
  One day,
Ronan threw his net out to sea.
Suddenly, he felt a tug...
a HUGE tug.
  He must have caught something really big!
  Pull, Ronan!
  Ronan used all his strength
to pull and pull the net out of the water.
Look what he'd caught   a beautiful seal.
  A seal?
  Ronan was very proud that he'd caught a seal.
Wow! What would everybody say?
Suddenly, the beautiful seal flicked her body
and the net slipped out of Ronan's hands.
  She escaped!
  Yes. But she swam away still covered in his fishing net.
Ronan was so disappointed.
Back on dry land, Ronan went to a tavern called the Fishy Tale.
His friends were very surprised when he told them about the THREE seals
  he'd nearly caught.
  He only caught one.
Yes, I know.
But Ronan thought it would sound even better
  if he said there were three of them.
  Ssh!
As Ronan finished telling his fishy tale,
in walked a man they hadn't seen before.
Oh!
Who was he, I wonder. Ooh!
The man asked Ronan
  if he was the famous fisherman who could catch seals.
  Ooh!
Ronan couldn't understand how the news had travelled so fast.
But, hey, he liked the idea that everyone was talking about him.
So he said yes, he was the famous fisherman who could catch seals.
The man was pleased.
He told Ronan that he worked for a very rich man
who wanted to speak to Ronan at once.
Ronan was thrilled. He agreed to go and see this rich man right away.
  But guess what.
  What?
  The rich man lived out at sea.
  Out at sea? That's odd.
  Yes. Ronan thought so, too.
The man said not to worry   Ronan could take them there
  in his fishing boat.
  Sounds a bit fishy to me!
When they had been rowing for quite a while, Ronan began to get scared.
The man told him not to worry   he would soon get a big surprise.
  Ssh!
  And what a surprise it was.
Suddenly,
the man pushed Ronan into the sea.
  Oh, no!
  Then the man jumped into the sea too.
  Oh!
But don't worry. Something amazing was happening.
Ronan was breathing! He could breathe underwater.
  Wow! Like a fish?
  Yes. And so could the man.
  Wow!
  Ronan and the man had turned into seals.
Together they swam deeper and deeper.
He wasn't scared. In fact,
he felt wonderful!
Down into the sea
He swam so easily
With a flick and a swish He swam around like fish
Yes, it was hard to believe That underwater he could breathe
He now knew how it feels
To swim and swim like seals
To feel well and truly free
Underneath the deep, blue sea
Another world, another place
He swam with a smile upon his face.
Finally, they came to a beautiful palace...
Wow! Look at that!
..and in they swam.
  Inside the palace was beautiful, too.
  Wow!
The rich man whom Ronan was going to meet
was actually the King of the Seals.
But, oh, dear, the King didn't look happy at all.
  Why?
  He was angry because his little daughter was trapped.
His daughter was the beautiful seal Ronan had caught earlier.
  She was still trapped in Ronan's fishing net.
  Oh, dear!
Ronan was the only one who could take it off. Ronan felt so sorry.
He took the net off at once.
The little seal was so happy to be free again that she hugged Ronan
and they both danced the magical dance of the seals.
A ah!
  Soon it was time for Ronan to go home.
  Aww!
They were now friends with Ronan,
for they knew he had learned his lesson.
Hooray!
Back on dry land, Ronan changed back into a man again.
He looked sadly towards the sea...
and caught sight of the beautiful seal.
She waved at Ronan, then disappeared under the waves,
  never to be seen again.
  Ah!
  He knew something else was true.
  What?
  He'd never catch a seal again.
The end.
I once heard a tale, a fishy tale Of seals that went for sail
Of a fisherman who one fine day Nearly caught a seal but it got away
The net got stuck and wouldn't let go
Till the fisherman freed it so
Next thing we know the fisherman, he
Was pushed into the sea
Then, shock, horror, yes, for real He had turned into a seal
Inside the palace on the floor
The sad, sad sight the fisherman saw
And trapped in his net, the princess seal so sorry did feel
As fast as a flash he set her free To swim around the deep, blue sea
That's the end of our fishy tale
Of the seals that went for sail.
