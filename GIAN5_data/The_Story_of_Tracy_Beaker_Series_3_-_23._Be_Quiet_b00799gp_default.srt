I can make my world come true All my dreams will see me through
  It doesn't matter What may come my way...
  No! No!
Believe me now I will win some day.
No! It's not a good idea. It's pathetic, like you.
Three foster parents in one day?
Normally, you can't find one.
It is an unusual idea.
We have discussed this. We need to make one big push for Tracy.
Tracy, PLEASE try and make a good impression.
Sometimes, I think you can come over as a bit...loud.
  I know that underneath you're actually...
  Louder!
Stop trying to be loud.
  I wasn't.
  You were.
  I wasn't.
  You WERE!
Tracy...it's worth a try.
We'll meet ALL the foster parents at the science museum.
I can't wait.
  What d'you know about nuclear physics, Trace?
  I'm not Trace.
Sorry...Tracy. They're doing a talk about the atom.
It'll blow your mind, won't it, Jemima?
  Dave's a physicist, Trace.
  Tracy!
My name is Tracy Beaker!
  Watch out, dur brain!
  Watch out, toilet brush!
"Dur brain!" Jake, I think she likes you.
I apologise for my son's behaviour.
I'm here to pay for any damage and clean up the mess.
Hey, nice clogs!
Has anyone seen my hair bobble?
  Hayley! Where did you come from?
  Nowhere.
You're so quiet...it's spooky.
  Thanks.
  Come on, Layla. Your lift's here.
  Bye.
Tracy, it's not your fault you dropped the nucleus.
She didn't have to throw the protons at the facilitator.
  Stick your protons up your nose!
  Hi, everyone. Having fun?
I've had more fun at the dentist.
OK, you two, time's up. I'm ready for the next lot.
I'm going back to the lecture.
He's very highly strung.
Tracy, what have you done?
What?
They're called Ron and Gwen. They're very nice.
They've got a caravan in Wales.
Tracy? Did you hear me? They have a caravan in Wales.
  I'm gonna go for a little wander.
  Hello, Elaine!
  Hello.
  Ron. Gwen. Hi.
You know, parking, Elaine... Parking is a science...
  You need to study it.
  Tracy!
Tracy...how are you, my love?
Let's take a look at you.
Get off me!
It took Gwen 13 times, before she squeezed the car into the space.
  Ron, Tracy doesn't want to talk about parking.
  No, I suppose not.
What about a spot of nosh, before we overexert ourselves, eh?
Come on!
Come on, Tracy.
Tracy!
  Tracy!
Can't beat brown sauce.
Elaine loves brown sauce. She's always having seconds.
Eat up, Elaine. We want to make a good impression.
You see, Tracy, I like the open air life, myself.
We've got a caravan.
Really? Would that caravan be in Wales, Ron?
As a matter of fact, it is. We keep it in a field near Ysbyty Ystwyth.
  Do you know Ysbyty Ystwyth?
  I'm not sure I do, Ron. It sounds fantastic.
She's lovely, isn't she? You'll be sorry to see her go.
She can't wait to get rid of me.
Come on, Elaine, eat up.
I think I need to go to the bathroom.
  I do hope you'll excuse me.
  Not on your own, you don't...
So do I.
She's great, isn't she?
Dreadful.
Pixie Boy to the rescue!
  Hey! You're a danger to traffic.
  She needs a bell or a bleeper.
All aboard to Quiet Town.
Ssh!
What's that?
Whoa! Hey!
Hayley!
What's all the noise?
I'm not quiet!
Ssh!
  Bye. Missing you already.
  Tracy!
  What?
  You were obnoxious.
I promise I'll be good with the next lot.
Can I trust you, Tracy?
Of course you can.
We need to give each other a bit of space.
'The universe,
'the cosmos, the night sky...
'the stars in all their glory,
'as you've never seen them before.
'Here we bring you a perfect view of the constellations of our galaxy.
'And brightest of all, the star system Beakerus,
'named after the great astronomer Tracy Beaker.
'Pale in comparison is Ursa Major, also known as the Great Bear.
'And there's Orion   the hunter.'
Hi, dur brain.
  What's your name?
  Tracy.
'Could Tracy Beaker report to reception
  'where your guardian is waiting for you?'
  Tracy who?
Tracy...Snodgrass.
Oh! Are you sure?
All right. I am Tracy Beaker. THE Tracy Beaker.
I ran off. They were snogging in the planetarium. It was disgusting.
Eurgh! Come on.
'The continuing adventures of...Volcano GIRL!'
We were worried sick.
WHAT were you thinking of?
  It was your stupid idea.
  Tracy, what are we going to do with you?
Kids, eh?
Let's grab a coffee. You look like you need one.
  I don't...
  Don't worry about them.
They'll be all right on their own. Come on.
  Hi, Layla. Good swim?
  Yeah. Great.
Thank you for the lift.
  We appreciate it, don't we, Tracy?
  Thanks. ..Come on, Jake. Come in.
  We'd better go.
  You've got to meet Jackie and Crash.
There's Justine   you'll hate her. Bouncer's OK.
Hayley is quiet.
Shelley's in charge. She doesn't know everything. Hi!
  Who's this?
  This is Jake and Tom. We met them at the museum.
  Elaine, you didn't take Tracy in a car with strangers?
  Well, it...
  Tom very kindly...
  I offered to give them a lift, after a coffee.
  Coffee? My, you have been busy(!)
  Well, quite frankly, Tracy...
< Volcano Girl!
I can be as loud as the rest. I can be noticed.
< I can be noisy.
  I can scream and shout! Volcano Girl!
  Excuse me.
< I can be as loud as the rest. I can be noticed.
  Hayley! What's the matter?
  I can be noisy. I can scream and shout!
I'm not quiet. I'm Volcano Girl!
You stole my bobble and said I was spooky.
You said I needed a bleeper or a bell. ..And you took my drink.
  Hayley, have we been ignoring you?
  I want my bobble back.
Can Volcano Girl chill out for five and take a vacation from eruption?
Marco!
Welcome to the wonderful world of Tracy Beaker!
