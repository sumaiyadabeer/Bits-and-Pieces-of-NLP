for democracy, we're going to put Good evening.
Our governments doing enough for the vulnerable in the big freeze?
Also, do you remember the 80s? The opening up of official files told
some memories. They tell us the thaw is on its way,
and in some parts of Scotland that's clearly true. But if we're
spared burst pipes and flooding, the next weather related crisis for
most of us will be the heating and fuel bills for this abnormally cold
period. Politicians across the UK are claiming credit and dishing
blame in respect of all sorts of benefits and payments, but the
bottom line for everyone is a much Older people are at the heart of
this issue. If you are over 60, you are entitled to the winter fuel
payment of £250. Over 80, it goes up to £400. The more controversial
payment is called cold weather payment. That is triggered when the
temperature in your area stays below zero for seven days. Plenty
of that recently. It has been increased from £8 a week to £25 per
qualifying week, but it is only payable to people who are already
in receipt of pension credits or equivalent social security benefits.
Scotland has as a result of its location are forced    of course
benefited more than other parts of the UK. The SNP have been calling
for the cold weather payment to be extended to more people, not just
the very poorest. And the Scottish Government has been promoting an
improvement in its energy assistance package, which provides
help for insulation and heating installation, for some locum at   
income groups. It hasn't entirely ruled out a version of the boiler
scrappage scheme. We are looking to see whether we should apply it. We
are providing free or discounted boilers for people who are fuel
poor, but if we can extend that depends on where we put our
priority. Our focus is on trying to help those people who are fuel poor.
All the parties are acutely aware that energy bills will concentrate
voters' minds with just months to     to the general election.
I'm joined now by the SNP's John Mason MP, in Aberdeen we have
Labour MP Ann Begg, and also in Glasgow Trisha McAuley who
specialises in fuel poverty issues for the Consumer Focus organisation.
Trisha McAuley, give us some idea, what sort of reports are you
getting of the problems people are having? We are getting reports of
real hardship. People having to make impossible decisions on a day 
to day basis to keep the house warm, to keep it at an acceptable what
level of once, to make decisions as to whether to put to a radiator on,
put the soup on the boil, or do both. Many pensioners living old
and large houses that have been the family for long time and are hard
to heat, and they are cold and damp. We get reports from people who have
been disconnected because they haven't paid their bills, they
haven't been able to afford it. Pensioners? Pensioners shouldn't be
disconnected because the industry has what it calls a safety net for
vulnerable disconnections. But some people do slip through and they get
through to us. It is still happening. Right. This is
get huge bills, not because they have got the bills. Yes. Basically
what people do is they self disconnect. They do not use the
heating, and they do not heat their homes to an acceptable level of
warmth to keep themselves healthy. And in effect they are self
disconnecting themselves from energy. People who do use... People
who need to use it more than others are stuck in the house. They have
got chronic illnesses or they are older so they need more heating.
And you do get disconnections and you get people with serious
problems. And what is your view of these two benefits that people like
that will get, the cold weather payments and the winter fuel
allowance? These are surely must help to some extent? They do help
to some extent, but there are better solutions to the problem. It
gets back to what I was saying, they are helping people out after
the event. They have got problems paying the bills and these help.
They are basically very much, it is like you are getting a handout.
Lots of pensioners will not take up pension credit. We know the take up
isn't good enough. People think asking for something extra special.
But we would like to see a basic recognition by the Government that
actually it is a basic right to have an affordable level of warmth
in your home, and to go back to the drawing board and start targeting
that and doing it and in a proper ,    to get this clear, because
this is a problem with elderly people, you are saying they may be
entitled to money but they are not getting it because they are not
claiming it. Yes. Because many of them think there is something more
of    morally questionable. Yes, they do. There are independent and
to not one to claim money.    they are independent. When they try to
claim money it is incredibly difficult. The forms that have to
be filled in, the call centres you have to go through. It puts people
off. There is so much more that could be done. The state knows
where every pensioner is, it wouldn't be hard to put a direct
mail in, or an advert in the newspaper. There is more to find
the people to encourage them to take it up. John Mason, what would
you like to see the Government doing right now? I think this was a
fix are to increase the cold weather payment and the winter fuel
allowance. Because that would make a difference now. They did increase
it, they travelled it. £8 up to £25 is absolutely dead.    they tripled
it.    it is absolutely terrific. But people are afraid to go out and
they have to heat their houses all day. Whereas sometimes they might
go at the library or go to clubs all do different things. There is a
problem because of the length of the cold weather. Ann Begg, is
their case for the Government stepping in and doing something   
is their case. I think a package explained what people are doing. It
has tripled the cold weather payment. The cold weather payments
are never get paid sometimes because we do not have the
prolonged cold spells. In Aberdeen there have been three payments of
£25 each. But what Trisha McAuley is suggesting that it is not enough.
At least in this case. I need to correct some of the
misapprehensions, and that is part of the problem why pensioners don't
claim credit because they are told it is difficult. The pension care
service to not have automated call centres. They actually do contact
every pensioner. They do a huge amount to try to get people to take
up their benefits, and sometimes people say they don't want it, we
have enough and we are not going to apply. It is unfair to criticise
the pension care service who have worked hard to... I am sure they
have, but wouldn't one simple... If we leave aside the levels of
allowance, it is the fact that in order to get these payments, at
least some of these payments, pensioners have to register for
pension credit. There surely must be some way of doing this so they
can get the money anyway? They do if they are in receipt of certain
benefits. They do not have to apply for the cold weather payment
separately. It is not a point. Hang on. The point Trisha McAuley is
making is that you do not get these payments unless you have already
registered for the pension credit. I am suggesting, surely an obvious
reform would be to give this to elderly people irrespective of
whether they have registered for pension credit. First of all
remember that the winter fuel allowance goes to everyone over 60.
Regardless of whether they on pension credit on not. They are
already getting to hand and £50... I understand that, it is the cold
weather allowance. But his only triggered when it is really cold.
We have to make sure it goes to the most vulnerable and those most in
need. In terms of pension credit, for the guaranteed credit, for
those who have police to apply for, the take up is 90 %.    believed to
apply for. For the savings could it, those who have a bit extra than the
It's not unreasonable to say, look, focus the money on those who needed
most. It might be crude, people not my dog register but using the
pension credit as a proxy for this seems that a bad way of doing it.
It's still a crude measure but yes, I wouldn't argue with that. What we
have to look that is what consumers are telling us. They are saying
they find it difficult to negotiate that maze. Lots of people have been
calling the helpline, I've seen it, the message is we've got from
consumers is they are finding it very difficult. I do agree, we need
to target it to people who needed most. The other thing we are
finding is, again, it's not those needed it most, but the people who
are just on the edge us who don't qualify. They don't get any help
whatsoever. They then get tipped into us. Its people on the edge to
it in that trap. If a lot of people are entitled to this and not
getting it, there is something wrong with the system. We need to
look at that automatically. seem to be suggesting that you
would like to see the winter fuel payments extended beyond people who
would apply, he would be eligible for pension credit, whether or not
they have applied for it. Yes, there are other people as well with
disability or other things. It's not unreasonable for Ann Begg to
say let's concentrate the money they have available on those with
the greatest need. We will have to why not the question   where is the
money going? Look at the money be found for the banks, look at the
money we are finding for nuclear weapons. Why can the some of that
money... Hall Barn, Alex Neal in the film    hold on, Alex Neal in
the film there, he showed at precisely the policy that Ann Begg
explained. Alex Neal said we had a fine and about of money    finite
amount of money. We want to focus it on the poorest. That is the
principal the British government is applying. The Scottish Government
has to live within the means it has. We have to widen out the picture,
to come and see the UK's Government's priorities are totally
wrong. I was just going to make a point that in 96 97 the Tory
government spend £60 million on helping pensioners with their fuel
bills. In this year, this government is paying £2,700 million,
£2.7 billion in it fuel payments. There is a huge difference in what
they're getting. Of course it's never enough. The stories that we
were told at the beginning of the package, these shouldn't happen in
the 21st century in the UK or in Scotland. It's wrong and we have to
make sure our pensioners get the money and the heating they need.
a regular basis our masters of government decided appropriate to
let us into the secrets of what they get up to behind the scenes.
But they only tell us 30 years later in case someone still in of
us can be held to account. The period of non disclosure is closing
   shortening. Today, Scottish files were opened from the mid 
1980s. Everything from AIDS to Piper Alpha to the Glasgow Garden
Festival, begging the question   Good evening, Scottish Local
authorities bowed to the Government's wishes over the
community charge. The poll tax was the product of Thatcherism,
although its genesis was very much in Scotland. The influence of a
Conservative government with patchy support in the north of Britain
provided the leitmotif to the decade. Margaret Thatcher was the
padded shoulders of the 80s, a style ominously coming back into
fashion in time for another at age of Toryism? The election of 87
brought a job lot of Labour suits straight off the peg, led by the
most resolutely unfashionable of them all. I'm not promising any
miracles. Today, government files were released on the 84 88 period.
Usually it takes 30 years. But not having been in power at the time,
the SNP sees no need to hide the secret dealings of Unionist
administrations. If the fashion was doubtful, this was a period when
Scottish Rocks made it big. thing that you can see in Scotland
in the 1980s was that there was a significant flourishing in popular
culture. Particular in areas like rock music and pop culture in
general, and the way they are connected in a complex way to
Thatcherism and the era of government, Labour's feeble 50. The
idea that the Scotland vote didn't matter. These were pre 
devolutionary days. The idea that Scotland didn't have its voice, and
therefore its boys had to be refracted through other things like
pop music and pop culture. We had everything, all the various
different bands representing Scotland. I think you take some
delight, Simple minds, we had a period of a famine, we had all the
big concerts for Africa being launched. Simple minds represented
Scotland on the Live 8 stage in a Philadelphia.    Live 8. Sky was
wondering if there ever be a bridge to replace the ferry. Glasgow be
keen    became a green place again with the garden festival by the
banks of the Clyde, Antolik was dug up and transplanted by the BBC.
Garden Festival, that was important for me because it's the year I
decided never to ride in a roller  coaster ever again! More seriously,
the Garden Festival was it really interesting period because it was
great fun. It was quite controversial, the idea that you
regenerate through pleasure and leisure and that this could provide
work. It was a radical idea and not a lot of people like it. They
thought there should be shipyards on that site. Nowadays it's taken
for granted that the creative industries are the future and that
leisure and tourism, you need a festival in the city every month.
It was also the period when a rush to exploit natural resources ended
in tragedy. We were learning how mad cow disease could infect some
humans, despite government denials. But there was no such official
restraint in warning us over AIDS. The virus can be passed during
sexual intercourse with an infected person. And as news comes this week
that Westminster will consider a minimum pricing for alcohol
following Sceux Gardens lead, it reminds us about Wolong national
hangover, which was another issues on ministers' desks 20 years ago.
We came full circle today when the SNP announced an end to the right
government being a manifestation of an early national steering is
I had a proper head of hair. I do miss the fact that at the time I
was in London working for the NME, and there was a really powerful,
but we stayed an awful lot longer than a weekend of the look at
tomorrow's front pages, starting with the Scotsman. It leads on
Haiti. Gordon Brown leads the call for help as the full extent of
Haiti earthquake horror it    unfolds. A test that can detect
Alzheimer's up to 20 years before any symptoms show has been
that or not. Haiti tragedy deepens as aid efforts are thwarted, bats
in the Times. The Independent, a picture of the tragedy in Haiti.
That's all from me this week. Glenn The thaw is upon us. It is slow at
the moment but it will accelerate in the next 48 hours. Friday will
be a great day, but the rain comes across in the north west of England
and that could fall as immediate ice on that ground. Otherwise,
weather. Cornwall does best of all. The southerly wind is nearly warm,
eight or nine degrees is quite possible. His reign is going to
really accelerate the thaw in Wales. In Northern Ireland, having had
rain overnight, the picture is already mild. There won't be much
snow left and I don't think ice is a risk. In Scotland, ice will be a
risk all night. Some snow will be added to the Highlands and the
southern Grampian is. The rain across the Pennines will leave a
