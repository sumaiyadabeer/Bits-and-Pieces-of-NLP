Tommy McCabe was my brother.
Your face is an absolute picture.
Eight years, four if I'm lucky.
So you are pleading guilty then?
I am guilty.
Your family will be waiting for you when you get out.
Is that what you want? All of us to be together, as a family?
That's all I ever wanted.
Hi. Dan!
No, no, I'm up.
Yeah. I'll be there soon.
It couldn't have happened at a worse time.
The article, I mean, not, you know, Michael.
The papers will find somebody else to go after sooner or later.
Hopefully sooner.
We've got someone coming in to discuss the practice today.
You're not letting the grass grow under your feet, are you!
I can't afford to, Gabe.
Did Leyla not mention it?
No. No... Well, I've not seen much of her since...
  Do you mind if I take this?
  I'm not keeping it for the scrapbook, if that's what you're asking.
Leyla's starting back at work today, maybe you could do the same.
Aye, maybe.
Good man.
That's me, all right. A good man.
Hello?
One moment, please. It's for you.
Hello?
Yes, speaking.
No, I don't have any comment to make!
Vultures! They make me sick.
The guy's just doing his job.
Well, he can do it without me.
  Did the boys get away OK?
  Yep.
Oh, Adeeb asked me to say he's staying late,
doing extra maths or something.
  Physics, but yeah.
  Knew it was something geeky.
Just leave it.
I had to take some money out of your purse...
for the boys' lunches and bus fares and things. Hope you don't mind.
No, no. Not a problem. I'm grateful for any help I can get today.
We're really pulling together, aren't we?
Yeah.
You're sorting the surgery...
and at home, we're one, solid, family unit
getting on with life, for my dad's sake. I mean...
that was the deal, correct me if I'm wrong.
No, that was...
That was definitely the deal.
Thought so.
All for one and one for all, eh?
Nicole!
No use crying over spilled milk.
Lenny, can I just, erm...
Have you... I was wondering, have you heard from Frances at all?
I mean, she left a note,
but it didn't really say anything, just that she was leaving,
so I've got her share of last week's takings here.
Maybe you could forward the cheque, if you know her new address?
Or if not, I could...
OK. Well, cheers.
  Is this going to take ages?
  I just need to get your details.
You know my details. You're married to my brother!
I haven't learned your hospital number off by heart, Scarlett.
I've been coming here long enough.
Look, I feel great. Can we not just skip it this month?
No way. I have to take your blood.
Nae offence, Tattie, but you sound like Dracula when you say that.
Why don't you just...take a seat.
Mr Anderson? What's taking so long? Where's my schedule for today.
The system wasn't backed up last night so it's doing it now...slowly.
  Why wasn't it backed up?
  I don't know.
Leyla. And now she's late, to make matters worse.
  I'm sure she'll be here soon.
  Good morning.
  Moment, please.
I do have an appointment.
OK, OK. Name?
Miriam Stubbs. Dr Miriam Stubbs.
You're Dr Stubbs?
The very same.
You're early.
Yes.
It's been said I make a habit of that, Dr Hunter.
Yes, Dan. I'm on my way.
All right!
  Hey.
  Gabriel!
I'll get it.
  I'm late already.
  Look, it'll only take a couple of seconds.
I don't have a second, not today.
Deals to be done, plans to be made. Dan mentioned it.
He was surprised you never said anything to me about it.
  It doesn't really concern you.
  You concern me, Leyla.
  I didn't mean...
  We have to sort out the surgery, that's all.
  Yeah.
Everything's moving so fast, eh?
Yeah. It is.
  Mrs Brodie?
  We're kind of in the middle of something here, pal.
Ian Millar. I just wanted a word.
Millar? Are you from the paper?
  That's right.
  In that case, you can have two words.
  Aye, and she disnae mean "no comment".
  I have to go.
  I'll drop this off later.
  Sure, sure.
You're the brother, right?
Well done, you. Well, at least you've got one fact straight.
It's news, Mr Brodie.
You're news. There's no point pretending otherwise.
Gabe...
Where's...
How...
What?
  What?
  Am I seeing things?
No, no. I don't think you are.
I'm going to kill Raymond!
  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean kill, obviously.
  Don't worry about it.
  Don't start, Dan. I know I'm late.
  And with good reason, I'm sure.
  Are you being sarcastic? The last thing I need is...
  This is Dr Stubbs.
  Mrs Brodie, I presume?
  Hi.
Right, that's me done.
Going to give me an appointment for next month, Leyla?
Yeah... Yes, of course.
Just give me a second.
A problem with the backup, apparently.
No, no, it's fine.
Done.
  Impressive. Pity you weren't here earlier.
  I can do this.
You have things to talk about, I think.
No, no, patient care first, practice business second.
Right, erm, Mrs Mullen, how about the...
4th at 9.45?
Certainly, Mrs Brodie.
Oh, Leyla!
  How are you?
  Me? I'm fine?
That's the spirit.
  They'll be wrapping fish suppers in it tomorrow.
  What?
Have you no' seen the paper, then?
Do you know, it's shocking how the papers crucify folk.
They couldn't unless the great unwashed provided the nails.
  Aye. Eh?
  Molly, have you got an actual appointment, or are you just on your paper round?
I'm just offering the lassie moral support!
How very community spirited of you.
And who are you when you're at home?
She's a doctor. Come on. Leave these poor folk alone.
I'm only trying to be neighbourly!
Well, she was a delight.
Shall we continue?
Let's do that. Leyla, can you bring the valuation report?
  Leyla? Is there a problem?
  Two minutes. It's at home.
You live within walking distance?
Just along the street. Won't be a moment.
Hello?
I'm really not interested in speaking to you, Mr Millar.
Please don't call this number again.
Unbelievable.
Millar?
A journalist. So called.
Yeah, we've had some at the school gates too.
Doing what?
Talking to me and Conor. Adeeb too, but not as much.
When did this happen?
On and off since my dad got arrested.
The boys didn't say anything cos they didn't want you worry
but I think you can handle it. You're a tough cookie.
Well, I don't want to be kept in the dark.
No, that would be horrible, wouldn't it?
Just imagine what all those awful reporters might do
if they knew everything.
Nick?
"Dr Death Wife In Sex Romps With Brother."
Stop it.
Why do they always call it a romp?
Is this what it's going to be like?
Angelic to everyone else, but trying to torture me?
That's about right.
Fine. You better get to school, then  
keep up your public persona.
Right. Yeah. Gotta study hard.
Are those my earrings?
Uh huh   I didn't think you'd mind.
I do. I don't want you going through my things. Get upstairs and take them off.
Is that what my uncle used to say to you?
Didn't end well, then?
Does it ever?
Suppose not. Listen, I wanted to ask you something.
No, not that.
Fire away.
How's Amber? I mean, how is she?
  What's it to you?
  Well, she's in jail, my brother's in jail,
and I just wondered if people, not criminals...
..how do people like that cope?
Fine. Far as I know.
As far as you know?
I don't visit. Her choice.
'Course.
I still send her stuff.
Right.
I'm still her father.
When she gets out, I'm still gonnae be her father.
This? This means nothing.
Family is forever.
Raymond!
Hold on.
  Raymond!
  I said hold on! I've really got to call Iona.
I think I can save you the trouble.
  What's going on?
  She says the deli's shut down.
Temporarily, aye.
Well, how did you not tell me about it?
  I didn't know it was going to happen.
  You own the place.
  Not any more.
  What?
  You've sold it?
  When?
It all went through yesterday
but I didn't expect the new owners to move so quickly.
What new owners? Is it still a deli?
Do I still have a job?
  No.
  No?
No. I mean, no, it's not still a deli.
It'll be like a wee supermarket, convenience store type of thing.
What about my job?
Yeah, I'm not really sure about that.
Raymond!
Tell you what, let me give the area manager a call.
Area manager? So it's a part of a chain?
Yeah. Dozens of shops all over Scotland.
They'll have their own folk!
Busy.
I bet he is.
Tell you what, I've got his business card here,
  why don't you give him a call later on?
  Gee, thanks.
You should've told her, Raymond.
  They're serious people, Eileen. They move fast.
  Sounds like it.
I've got a delivery coming. Give me a minute to deal with that
and I'll bring you up to speed, OK?
Can't wait.
So, did you find us OK?
I came by bus.
Helps get a sense of the area, sense of what's occupying the locals.
Right.
I live around here,
so getting a sense of the locals hasn't been a problem.
Yourself and Dr Brodie, both on the doorstep, so to speak?
So to speak?
Unusual in this day and age.
So you've mainly been a locum up to now?
Mainly.
Apologies for the minor delay,
I should have all the information we need, so shall we get started?
Love to.
That's the original valuation report
from when Michael and I took over the practice.
You should be able to see how the practice has expanded and developed
over the last two years.
I'm sure I shall.
Why don't you let me absorb?
If you don't mind me sitting in your husband's office, of course.
No, that's something I'll need to get used to, isn't it?
Possibly, yes.
Take your time.
I shall.
Lenny?
Lenny, can I have a word?
  What, what is it? Is it the boy? Is it all right?
  Aye, he's fine.
  Where is he?
  He's at nursery, where do you think?
Oh, aye, right. Do you want me to pick him up?
I'll do it, I'm only working in the salon this morning anyway.
I've had to drop my hours at the arcade.
That's why I'm here, just wanted to let you know.
You need to spend more time with the boy, it's important.
Aye, well, he's fine. Are you OK?
Aye, I'm fine?
Have you heard fae Frances since...
  Nothing.
  Nothing?
  People split up, Kelly Marie.
  Aye, but they don't just pack in their jobs
and disappear off the face of the Earth.
Maybe she wasn't the settling down type.
  Well, Cal will miss her.
  He'll get over it.
Seems like you have already. Anyway, I'll see you later.
So I got to thinking   after Christmas,
takings were down and I couldn't see the deli picking up new business.
Folk just don't have the money.
Is this you giving me a lecture on economics?
No, this is me saying I was all up for a revamp,
going to make the place more like a supermarket
when this company approaches me, first, out the blue.
Serendipity, that's called.
Yeah, well, then I got to thinking,
"Why don't I just take the money up front
"and let them take on the expense and the risk."
Decent offer, too.
  Wow.
  Wow, indeed.
What are you going to do with it? It's not the best time for investments.
No, but...
I thought we could maybe put it towards wee Stuart's future...
He could go to private school.
Well, I was thinking more like uni or a flat.
Why wait? We want to give him the best start possible in life.
Yeah, but...
Raymond, this might just be the best idea you have ever had.
  Sorry.
  Sorry.
You're forgiven, you've obviously got a lot on your mind.
I'm good at reading people.
Yeah, well so am I.
  You've got the word "creep" written on your forehead.
  OK, OK, busted!
I'm not trying to hit on you. I just want to talk.
You're a reporter?
  Uh huh. And I know a great story when I see one.
  Do you?
Come on   teenage runaway, dad in jail, keeping it together somehow.
Someone's going to make a movie about you.
  Well, see if they do, you can buy a ticket.
  I will, seriously.
See the bit where my dad kills a guy, that'll be brilliant, won't it?
Hey, you, leave her alone.
I can handle it.
She's a remarkable young woman.
You need to back off. Now.
I hope you're not threatening me.
You keep away from my family or I'll do more than that.
  You OK?
  You're not my family. Not any more.
  Come on, Nicole.
  You're nothing to me and you're nothing to my dad.
Hello, could you give me the number for Glasgow North prison please?
No, you can put me straight through.
Dozens of arrests. Some East End.
Mainly Southside, what does that tell you?
McCabe people.
  To a man.
  What about to a woman?
  Did they not nick auld Aggie while they were at it?
  Mrs McCabe is dead.
They found her body at some cottage in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, well, rot in hell, rot in jail, what do I care?
Lenny, these arrests, these raids, they've came out of nowhere.
Nowhere.
To me, that suggests somebody inside the organisation naming names.
Yeah, you could be right.
As your legal representative,
is there anything I should be concerned about?
I know there was never any love lost between you and Tommy.
No.
But if there were ever any brief,
mutually beneficial joint enterprises in the past...
No. Nothing.
Good.
Because it's my understanding that Donald is confident
  he can make this lot stick.
  Donald?
  Extremely confident.
Which is why I was so concerned.
You and I both know he'd like nothing better than to see you in the dock.
Right, tell you what, you go and speak to your people
in the fiscal office and the police. See if my name comes up at all.
You just said you had no McCabe connections.
Better safe than sorry, aren't we?
  Go on, off you go, go and do it.
  What about you?
I've got somewhere I need to be.
A few things to sign.
What do you think of our prospective partner?
Hard to say.
If she played her cards any closer to her chest,
she'd have her hands behind her back.
Do you think you could work well together?
  Beggars can't be choosers.
  We're not beggars yet.
  No?
  Dan, the ad's been online less than a week.
And how many enquiries have you had to deal with?
It's early days.
How many?
One.
And do you think being on the front page of the papers again is doing us any favours?
No.
  No. We need her, Leyla.
Yeah?
Perfect timing.
  Leyla will make you an appointment.
  Now would be a good time.
  Now is out of the question. Dr Hunter is busy.
  Posh boy? I don't want him anyway.
Dr Brodie's otherwise engaged.
You might have read about it?
Aye, so what, her auld man gets himself banged up,
I've got to suffer for it, is that it?
I'm afraid we don't have a locum today.
Well, get one. You a doctor, sweetheart?
  As a matter of fact I am, sweetheart.
  She'll do.
You can't throw your weight around, Lenny, and get what you want.
I'm not stealing your pocket money in the playground.
All I want to do is see a doctor, and if we're being professional about it,
I think you'll find it's Mr Murdoch, right?
Mr Murdoch, I'm not even permitted to look at your records.
If that's all that's bothering you, permission granted.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Perhaps we could have a very brief chat,
if that's all right with you Dr Hunter, of course.
Fine, if it gets him out of here.
So how would you categorise this episode?
Categorise?
Severe? Debilitating?
Well, I can still move.
That much was apparent when you bulldozed your way in.
I take it's a problem with your vision?
My eyes have been blurry all day
and if I stand up too quick, the room spins.
Have you been prescribed a course of injections yet?
  Yeah.
  How's that coming along?
  It's not.
  You're not taking them?
  Not religiously.
  I don't have you down as a squeamish person.
Have you ever spent much time around junkies, doctor?
My fair share, I suppose.
Does it not make your skin crawl,
you know, when you see them stick needles in their own arms?
Not particularly.
Well, it does me. Dr Brodie, he got that.
Dr Brodie is detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, unfortunately.
You're here.
I can't inject you, Mr Murdoch.
You're not my patient.
I'm no' letting that other clown dae it.
Nor should he.
You need to attend a clinic
until you're comfortable injecting yourself.
No. Too public. I don't like people knowing my business.
I imagine that collapsing in the street would draw more attention
to your condition than dropping into a clinic, but the choice is yours.
You on a go slow today, Zinnie?
Forgive me if I've got other things on my mind.
Missed a sale in town, have you?
Actually, I happen to be worried about my family, OK?
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.
D'you want me to serve?
Um, no. Don't worry about it.
I won't let it get me down.
  What can I get you, sir?
  G & T, thanks.
Sure.
You sound like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders.
You don't want to know.
Try me, I'm a good listener.
Quite an eventful morning, then.
I hope you've had enough time to process all the facts and figures.
I think so, but patient rosters, budgets, that's only half the story.
And you want the whole story, is that it?
Did you get my text?
I've lost my phone... Mislaid it, I mean.
Nicole, this is Dr Stubbs. This is my stepdaughter, Nicole.
Are you taking over from my dad?
It's a possibility.
I hope you'll be really happy here.
How kind of you to say so.
It's the way I was brought up.
  What did it say?
  What?
  This all important text?
  There was more press at the school today.
Conor's head of year said he freaked out.
Are they sending him home?
He wanted to stay. Football.
I'll speak to him tonight.
If you need some time now.
I don't. Thanks, Nic.
Just doing my bit.
And a very commendable bit it is.
We're all in this together.
She's what, 15?
A difficult age, even under ideal circumstances.
And our circumstances are far from ideal.
  Look, I'm monopolising your time...
  So long as you're not wasting it.
Sorry?
Are you still interested in the practice?
I'm interested.
Get out, beat it, do you not think this family have suffered enough?
  I thought this was a public house?
  We were only talking.
Just wait and see how it reads in that scummy newspaper of his.
Don't worry, Leyla, I've told him to sling his hook.
Your niece was painting a very positive picture.
Your paper refers to my husband as Dr Death.
I don't think a few kind words will make up for that.
Persecution is what it is.
  Hi.
  Hi. There's some soup left if you want some.
Actually, I've just had lunch with Delia McMasters.
That name rings a bell. She a councillor as well?
Town planning.
Really full of herself today.
Apparently, they've rubber stamped a new call centre on Bolt Street.
Nice to hear of something opening for a change.
Yeah. 300 jobs and you'd think she was responsible for every one of them.
Good news, though, eh? Folk need work.
Yeah, folk who'll be popping into the new supermarket
on the way in, and lunchtime, and on the way home.
Yeah, I sup...
The supermarket people knew about this, didn't they?
Probably.
That's why they moved so fast, before I could put the price up.
Looks like it.
If you'd told me you were selling I'd have spoke to Delia first.
Yeah, well... that'll teach me to do anything on my own.
Where are you going?
To pull pints. That's all I'm good for, obviously.
Here he is, the great "I am".
  I'm not in the mood, Bob.
  Not in the mood?
  You've got some cheek.
  I'm the one that's lost their job.
  I gave you the guy's number.
Aye, and I got through to him, finally.
"All applications will be given careful consideration."
I mean, I ran that place for years.
  Well, maybe if you'd ran it better I wouldn't have had to sell it.
  What are you saying like?
I'm saying that the world doesn't owe you a living, and I certainly don't!
What's up with her?
Him!
Oh, aye, I heard about what you done to that lassie.
You get on with your work, Scarlett,
unless you fancy looking for a new job as well.
Yes, sir, no, sir, three bags full, sir!
I didnae know the Oyster did deliveries.
We almost never do. Just for special customers who like to order, pay,
then leave the building and forget to come back.
That's right, so I did.
Can't have you starving, can we?
Sorry, I really need to get this.
That's all right. I'll get a plate. I bet Liz is a stickler for crumbs.
Gabriel Brodie.
Thanks for getting back to me.
OK, so now what?
I mean, what else can I do?
Aye, OK, I'll give that a try.
Thanks anyway.
Nae luck?
  Oh, aye. All bad.
  Who was it?
It was the prison.
Is your brother all right?
I mean, I saw the paper and that.
  I wouldn't know, Stella. He won't see me.
  How?
We had a bit of a falling out.
Right. I see.
Do you?
Not really.
No.
Gabe, I kinda need to get back to the cafe   are you gonnae have this?
I'll have it later.
Have it now.
Michael might be in the jail but you need to get on with your life.
I wish it was that easy, Stella.
Eh, it is. Just take it one bite at a time.
Right. See you later.
These are on me, no arguing.
Thank you, Scarlett.
Very close knit community you have.
You make that sound like it's a bad thing.
Not necessarily. May I speak frankly?
Please.
I'm not sure that living on the doorstep of the practice
is such a good idea.
That's the way Michael wanted it. He wanted us to be at the heart of things, a real presence.
There are pros and cons, I suppose.
I can tell you one pro.
I don't think that woman would be alive today if she was just a patient.
She was a neighbour and that made a difference.
I hope you won't take this process too personally.
It's hard not to. You're not here to analyse facts and figures.
You could do that anywhere. You're here to analyse me and Dan.
Do you blame me?
Not at all.
So how are we doing up to now?
Short answer is, "Remarkably well."
Unfortunately, the longer answer is required.
I was afraid it might be.
"Remarkably well, under the circumstances."
Yeah.
Mrs Brodie, anybody investing in your practice
would be taking an enormous risk.
Enormous.
Mrs Brodie and I had a very interesting chat, Dr Hunter.
Yeah, I kind of got that impression.
She's not interested.
I believe I said the business represented a huge risk.
Well, I'm not risk averse.
So you're in?
I feel there are some points need addressing.
Primarily, your standing in the community.
But we both live and work here. I think that demonstrates our commitment.
There is a total absence of professional distance.
You're too close in every sense.
It was Michael's dream to build something in the heart of the neighbourhood.
You're not in the heart of the neighbourhood,
you're in the eye of a hurricane.
  Leyla not around?
  She's busy.
I'll wait.
  It might be a while.
  Then I'll wait a while.
  She's in a meeting, it's important.
  Oh, if it's important...
They are talking about the future of this place, Gabriel.
It means my future too.
Well, what are you doing out here, then?
Gabriel!
Gabriel, please!
Sorry, I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
  I asked him to wait.
  This is not a good time, Gabriel.
Yeah, so people keep telling me.
Are you divvying up my brother's business?
  It's good to see you getting on with your life.
  Eye of the storm.
We're not getting on with our lives, we're fighting for them!
  Don't get superior with me, sunshine.
  Gabriel, please leave.
I'm sick and tired of people giving me the brush off round here.
I'll come with you.
Come on. Let's talk outside.
Sorry.
What's the matter with you?
I'm getting frozen out, that's what's the matter.
You, Michael, Dan even Nicole.
You're all deciding what happens next and I don't get a say.
That's just the way it has to be.
  Right.
  For now, at least.
Until I know how we're going to keep a roof over our heads,
until we're off the front pages, and until Nicole stops trying
to drive me insane, I can't think about anything or anyone else.
  I want to help.
  You can. You will.
Michael won't see me.
You phoned the prison?
Aye, nice young lassie told me to call back in a month.
Her name's Lorraine.
She says the same to me.
Believe it or not, your brother's not in any rush to see me either.
Look, I need to get back in there.
Is this woman going to buy into the practice?
I doubt it.
I hope I didn't, y'know, throw a spanner in the works,
bursting in like that.
It probably didn't make any difference.
Just let me know how it goes.
Yeah, I will, I'll call you.
  You'll need this.
  What?
It's your phone. I fixed it.
Thank you.
Like I say   I want to help.
'At home, we're one solid family unit. Getting on with life.
'For my dad's sake. I mean, that was the deal.
'Correct me if I'm wrong.
'That was definitely the deal.'
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
  'Please leave a message.'
Mr Millar, this is a message from Nicole Brodie.
I'm ready to tell you everything.
Can we get to the point, please? I take it all this analysis
is leading up to you offering less than the asking price.
I am prepared to pay the amount suggested,
I'll just need more for my money.
  What do you mean?
Are you serious?
I certainly wouldn't joke about such a thing.
Fine, well, the answer's no.
You know where the door is.
I'd be left with, what, 10%?
  Yes.
  You're not selling up Leyla.
You built this business, you and Michael.
And that, I'm afraid, is the problem.
If this practice is to be forever associated with Dr Death,
that won't do much for patient registration.
We've had a lot of support, actually.
Yeah? From people who think of you as friends, neighbours, yes,
but what about the bulk of your patients?
  Have there been transfers?
  A handful.
So far.
So that's your final offer, then?
  There are conditions attached.
  Such as?
If anything else occurs which brings the business into disrepute,
you walk. Immediately.
And who gets to be judge and jury for that, you?
I imagine that would be decided in the court of public opinion.
Look, I know it's a lot to take in.
I don't expect an instant decision. Tomorrow morning will be fine.
That's good of you.
We'll give it careful consideration.
Right, Madonna's watching a film   spill.
  About what?
  Why you're suddenly going to talk to that journalist.
You said they were all creeps.
Not all of them. How's my eye shadow?
  Good, yeah.
  He's bringing a photographer. I need to look really hot
if I want to get on the front page.
  Why do you want to be on the front page?
  Maximum impact.
  Is he going to pay you?
  You think I'm doing this for money?
I don't know why you're doing it.
I'm doing it because I want everyone to know what's been going on!
  Everyone.
  What do you mean?
I mean, my dad's not the only guilty one.
You're not making any sense.
You'll understand when you read the paper, won't you?
I don't really like this top. Can I borrow one of yours?
I think my stuff might be a bit small on you.
Then I'll definitely get on the front page, won't I?
I'll be two seconds, listen for Madonna.
  The nerve of that woman.
  I know.
Pompous, superior, manipulative.
Yes all that and more. I think we should take the offer.
  You're joking, right?
  It's the only one on the table.
You're sacrificing a lot, Leyla.
I don't think of it as a sacrifice if you don't have any other choice.
Hey, don't fill up on snacks. I'll sort dinner when Adeeb gets in.
You're welcome to join us if you want?
Thanks, but I'm seeing Kelly Marie. How are you, Conor?
How do you think?
He's had a rough day at school.
  I'll get over it.
  You will.
We all will. The press will find someone else to harass.
  You reckon?
  Of course.
  Not while my sister's giving interviews they wont.
  She's not talking to the...
She was on her way to meet some journo when I got home.
  What journo?
  I'll deal with it.
Hey, you look great.
Thanks.
If we weren't related, I'd be conned into serving you booze.
We're not related and I'd like a lemonade.
  Right, where is she?
  I don't know.
Your mum said she was over borrowing clothes earlier.
She didn't tell me where she was going.
I don't believe you.
Leyla, please, don't talk to my daughter like that.
I'm sorry it's just... Nicole's gone off with this journalist.
If she talks to the press
then Miriam won't want to buy into the practice  
neither will anyone else, for that matter.
What she can say that isn't already said?
  Leyla?
  What?
How bad is it?
Bad.
It's bad.
Zinnie, look I need to keep this number clear.
All right, yeah,
I'm on my way.
Wait, please.
No. I'm going to make this right.
You can't stop me.
I know. Can I sit down?
Suit yourself.
So when's the erm, the interview?
Any minute. "Dr Death's Daughter   Exclusive."
  Do you know what you're going to say?
  The truth.
About me? Gabriel?
About everything.
Fair enough.
I wont ask you to lie to protect me. I deserve whatever's coming.
Yeah, you do.
Just...
Just think for a second.
Think about what this will do to your dad, reading this in prison.
Think about the boys going to school.
Think about the press getting their claws into you,
finding out about Stevie, raking up the past.
It's not the past though, is it? You're still at it with him.
  I'm not. I haven't.
  I saw you today.
He had your phone, or did you leave it over at his place?
I dropped it in the street, he fixed it for me.
Look, Nicole, punish me all you like
but you'll be hurting your dad, Stevie, the boys and yourself.
Nicole, I think these are the gentlemen you're waiting for.
Something about an interview?
Thanks, I'll take it from here.
You missed your chance, pal.
You'll need to hack into my voicemails or something.
  Let me get your coat.
  I'm not staying long.
So why come in at all?
There's something you should know.
All right, here we go.
Nicole just came this close to telling the journalist all about us.
Imagine it. Imagine that for a second.
Sordid, grubby headlines.
  And all of them true.
  What?
  Everyone who read them would think we were disgusting.
  No.
  And they'd be right.
  Stop it, Leyla.
It wasn't like that.
It was exactly like that.
All right, I get it.
This is the bit where you pretend that you don't love me.
This is where I stop pretending I ever did.
You know, I know what's real and what's not.
Or are you going to say that you faked everything, then?
No, no, you're right,
the sex was real.
It just meant something very different to me.
Right?
Yeah, you were the one buying toy cars as little love tokens,
I was the one cleaning the sheets before my husband came home.
I mean, how romantic do you think that was, Gabriel?
The thought of it...
The thought of us...
..disgusts me now.
So...
..we'll be civil to one another. Polite in public.
But that's it.
I never want to see you like this again.
What's wrong? Can't trust yourself to be alone with me?
I can't stomach myself alone with you.
I'll get that, and one for me.
What are we drinking to?
Me, of course.
Even so, couldn't let this waste, eh?
Thanks, keep the change.
Well, here's to you cleaning up the mean streets of Govan.
Actually, we're celebrating my promotion.
Detective Chief Inspector.
That's nice. You'll be able to afford a half decent suit.
What I'll be able to do is send team after team of detectives after you, Lenny.
So what is it?
No matter how long it takes, how much manpower, you're gonnae get me.
Yes.
She gave up the McCabes, but not me.
Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, aye, you do.
You didn't smash any empires.
Frances gave you everything you needed, but she didn't give you me.
You've made my day, Detective Chief Inspector.
I'll have another one if you like,
or have you got to rush back to your task force?
Frances couldn't take the stand against you.
Not since she was sleeping with both of us.
Still, she was worth it, don't you think?
I really hope you're not harassing my client again, Mr Donald.
Not at all, Hamish. We were just chatting about a mutual friend.
Next time I see Viv, I'll give her your best, eh?
We don't need to worry about him.
Lenny, are you listening to me? It's good news.
Every single arrest is McCabe related.
They've got nothing on anybody else.
Our policeman friend gets his name in the papers and a promotion
but that's it.
Not quite.
  Sorry?
  All those arrests, half the city's up for grabs.
There for the taking.
Only by somebody foolish enough to go head to head with Donald.
Tell me you're not thinking about that, Lenny.
Lenny?
Head to head?
Nah, I'm going to bring him to his knees and I'm gonnae enjoy it.
Got a visitor for you. Everybody's favourite tycoon.
Have you got a minute?
'Course I have. I'm a lady of leisure now, aren't I?
Thanks to you.
Can we talk in private?
It's all right, Stella.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Are you?
Look, it's a big organisation, they caught me on the hop a wee bit.
If it's any consolation, I think I got burned on the deal.
It isn't.
  What?
  Any consolation.
Oh.
That wasn't just a job, it was a wee link to my sister.
I know, I should've thought of that.
  Shame you didn't.
  I'm sorry.
  So you said.
  Look, I'll give you an amazing reference,
you can even dictate it to me while I'm buying you a drink.
I'm fine here, thanks.
  Howdy, partner.
  What?
Should you not be at the arcade making me some money?
I couldn't give a monkey's about the arcade, mate.
Spoken like a real loser.
Don't mess with me Murdoch, all right.
Keep your hands off me!
Gabriel, enough!
Do you know who you're dealing with here, hard man?
  OK, boss, the boy's having a rough time.
  Yeah, life's a bed of roses for the rest of us, isn't it?
Put your hands on me again, it'll cost you.
Understand that?
Lenny will be desperate to fill the vacuum the McCabes have left behind.
  What the this?
  It's for protection.
  You get caught with that, you'll do double the time.
Get home right now.
  Screw you.
  Conor!
  You got a warrant?
  I can get one in under an hour.
I'll go 70 30, any deal we do thegither.
Some real money to be made.
Think about it.
