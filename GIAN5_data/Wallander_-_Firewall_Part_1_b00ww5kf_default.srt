This programme contains some strong language.
Shocking.
OK. Steady.
One, two, three.
Let's put a little squiggle on here.
  You once said no violence.
  Sometimes justice demands violence, Solomon.
Your family would have been proud of you. You know that?
And so am I.
Thank you...Father.
What do you mean Tynnes is dead?
He can't be dead, we need him, for Christ's sake!
Solomon, listen.
They mustn't get any information that'll put them on the right track. You understand?
They're too close now.
You do whatever's necessary.
Sonja!
Hi.
  Sorry?
  Er...she has escaped from the police.
  This girl?
  Yes.
That's good news, Solomon. Well done.
Find her. Call me as soon as you do.
She'll lead you to where he is. Be patient.
Kurt?
Oh.
Binkabi. Binkabi.
Oh.
'Father, I made a mistake. The police know about Barclays Bank.'
OK, don't worry. All that matters is that they don't find our centre.
That would ruin everything. If anyone even gets close to it...
..kill them.
'Hello, my son.'
Father, just want you to know they're searching his apartment again.
'Have they found it yet?'
It's not there. I've been there already.
'Don't worry, my son.
  'Just remember what we're fighting for.'
  What do you want me to do?
'We've crossed the line already. Trust me. The plan's got to change.'
'Hello, my son.'
They've found it.
'You've got to be fucking joking!'
OK. You know what to do. Do it!
You promised me it wouldn't come to this!
  'Sooner or later, everything comes to this.'
  OK, Father.
