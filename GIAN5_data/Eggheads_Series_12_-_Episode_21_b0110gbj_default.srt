These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain.
Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country.
The question is   can they be beaten?
Welcome to Eggheads, the show where a team of five quiz challengers
pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz team in Britain.
They've won some of the country's toughest quiz shows. They are the Eggheads.
Taking on our quiz Goliaths today
are Un Oeuf Is Enuf. This family team all hail from the town
of Bispham near Blackpool, certainly a place with a lot of je ne sais quoi. Let's meet them.
Hi, I'm Dave, I'm 52 and I have a joke and novelty wholesale business.
Hi, I'm Trish, I'm 48 and I'm a primary school teacher.
Hi, I'm Ian, I'm 56 and I'm a service engineer.
Hi, I'm Ray, I'm 27 and I'm an ICT teacher.
Hi, I'm Tom, I'm 23 and I'm a carer.
Welcome to you, Un Oeuf Is Enuf.
I don't think I'll be using your team name too often. I come over all Peter Sellers in The Pink Panther.
  But I'm guessing it's a reference to the Eggheads?
  It certainly is.
"Un oeuf" is French for "one egg" and we feel that one Egg is enough to beat all five of us.
We're going to give it a good go and hopefully...
  I know you're a family team. You must have got together on family occasions and quiz a bit?
  We do.
We enjoy board games and card games and Trivial Pursuit and we watch Eggheads religiously.
OK, Un Oeuf Is Enuf... Right. I'll call you "the challengers"!
Every day there is £1,000 up for grabs for our challengers.
If they fail to defeat the Eggheads, the prize money rolls over.
So, Un Oeuf Is Enuf, the Eggheads have won the last 14 games,
which means £15,000 says you can't beat the Eggheads today.
Who would like to play this?
  What do you think, Tom?
  Good luck.
  Do you want to go for that one?
  That'll be me.
OK, Tom, stay with us because you have a task before you depart for the question room.
Who would you like to play from the Eggheads? Choose one of them.
  What do you think?
  I'd like to play CJ.
OK, Tom and CJ, into the question room to make sure you can't confer with your team mates.
  So, Tom, would you like to go first or second?
  I'd like to go first.
Your first question. Which English musician, a member of The Move, ELO and Wizzard, wrote the song,
I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day?
I'm really not sure, to be honest. I haven't got a clue.
Whenever I don't know a question, I tend to just go for the middle one.
So I'll just have a wild guess and say the middle one   Jeff Lynne.
OK, Jeff Lynne... They certainly worked together at ELO.
But it's not Jeff Lynne. It's Roy Wood.
Roy Wood.
Not Jeff Lynne. So a chance for CJ to take an early lead.
The singer known as Sting was born near which English city?
I'm just trying to think of his accent.
It's not a Geordie accent, is it, so I don't think it's Newcastle.
It sounds more West Country to me than Liverpool.
I don't know. I'll try Bristol.
About 500, 600 miles out.
  Wrong. It is Newcastle.
  Oh, is it? Oh, dear.
So it stays all square. Nothing there.
No damage done. Tom, your second question.
What is the title of the song associated with Dean Martin that contains the line,
"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie"?
The next line in that song, I think, is "that's amore",
so instinct says I'm going to go for that one.
So I'm going to go for That's Amore.
I had to be careful reading the question. That's the first option.
I had to put a pause in there. But you picked it out   That's Amore.
CJ, George Gershwin's composition Rhapsody In Blue opens with a trill,
followed by a glissando on which instrument?
I think it's clarinet, but let me have a quick mull. It's not trumpet.
  Yeah, it's a clarinet.
  Yeah, we're hearing it in our brains silently.
Clarinet. So matching each other
with a wrong answer on the first one and correct answers on your second questions.
Tom, which influential American rock band, who had considerable success in the 1970s,
was led by the partnership of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker?
It's still before my time.
Again I really haven't got a clue.
I'll stick to my routine and go for the middle one if I don't know.
So, Boston, please.
OK, Boston, it's not.
If only your guessing had been to the right hand side.
It's Steely Dan. It's that side of it again.
So two unsuccessful guesses leave you on one
and CJ with a chance to take the round.
CJ, Tim Burgess found fame as the lead singer with which British indie rock band
who had their first UK chart single in 1990?
I don't suppose you can tell me what the title of that single was?
It's not Suede. James are certainly an indie band.
I mean, their big hit was Sit Down.
It might have been about 1990, actually.
I know it's not Suede and I know nothing about The Charlatans.
James, I think fits the bill in terms of time
and the description of the band. I will try James.
James...
No, it's not. It is The Charlatans,
the other one you thought, but didn't pick out.
So low scoring on the first three questions. They had multiple choice.
I wonder how you're going to do, now we've taken those choices away? Tom, it's Sudden Death.
Sisters Easther and Vernie Bennett with Kelle Bryan and Louise Nurding
were the original line up of which 1990s British R&B group?
Louise, if that is the Louise that's married to Jamie Redknapp,
it will be...Eternal?
I'm going to go for Eternal.
  Eternal?
  Yeah.
  Picking out Louise there...
Yes, it's the right answer. Well done.
Eternal. Well done.
CJ, which band recorded the original version of the song Everybody Hurts
which was re recorded in 2010 to raise money for victims of the earthquake in Haiti?
  That's REM.
  It is REM, yes.
OK, back to you, Tom.
In which Andrew Lloyd Webber musical does the character Norma Desmond feature?
I'm sure my other team mates know, but I really can't think. My mind's gone completely blank.
  Oklahoma.
  Oklahoma...
  That's a random guess.
  It's certainly a musical. CJ?
  Sunset Boulevard.
  Sunset Boulevard.
And your question, CJ.
Who had a UK top ten single in 1996 with Because You Loved Me
from the soundtrack to the film Up Close & Personal?
I think the film is Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer
and I think that most of the tracks on that were sung by Celine Dion.
It's the correct answer, CJ, Celine Dion.
Up Close & Personal, the song Because You Loved Me. Bad luck, Tom.
The way those fell... There was precious little contemporary stuff for you. '70, '50s, musicals.
CJ will be in the final round and you won't be, Tom. Could you both come back and join your teams?
Well, after a tight round there,
CJ won through, so one brain from Un Oeuf Is Enuf will be missing at least from the final round.
Our next head to head is Film & Television.
  Who'd like to play this?
  I'm going to take this one.
Ray, you've got it. Who would you like to play? It can't be CJ.
  Chris?
  Absolutely.
  I'll stick with Chris, I think. Yeah.
Let's have Ray and Chris into the question room then.
  So, Ray, do you want to go first or second?
  I think I'll go second.
Putting Chris in then.
And Chris, your first question.
The US TV series Glee is mainly set in what type of establishment?
This is quite enjoyable. You can quite get into it.
It's set in a school.
A school, it is. Yes, of course. A school.
Ray, which TV game show, first broadcast in 1979,
featured contestants trying to match their answers with those of six celebrities?
Right... I wish I'd gone first now.
I think I'm going to go with Tom's idea of going down the middle.
I'm going to go with Crosswits.
It's Blankety Blank, the six celebrities which was a definition
which was stretched at some points during its run.
Chris, who played Tom Chance, the title role in the 1980s comedy series Chance In A Million?
That was a strange series with Brenda Blethyn as his girlfriend.
It was Simon Callow.
Simon Callow... Yeah, Simon Callow, right answer.
So you do have a 2 0 lead.
The pressure is immense on you, Ray. You must get this.
Which film released in 2010 stars Steve Carell and Tina Fey
as married couple Phil and Claire Foster?
OK, luckily, I have heard of this one and it's not before my time.
I'm going to go, uh, Date Night.
Date Night is correct, yes.
Grabbed that and needed to, but will it be enough?
Chris, what is the name of the baby voiced by Bruce Willis in the 1989 film Look Who's Talking?
I've never seen it, but a voice in my head is saying Mikey. I'll say Mikey.
Mikey... Bruce Willis covering himself in glory as the voice
of the baby in Look Who's Talking called Mikey.
It is correct, Chris, which means you've taken the round.
Nothing you could do, Ray, having got that first one wrong. You won't be in the final round.
Would you both come back and join your teams?
The way it's going so far, guys, you might have to change your team name to Cinq Oeufs Are Enuf.
You've lost two head to heads. Let's stop the rot with our next one.
This is Politics. Who'd like to play this?
  Oh, Ian!
  Oh, Ian!
  Can he go again?
  I'll go.
  Bad luck, Tom. Can't play again. So, Ian, you're going to take it on.
Which Egghead would you like to play? Daphne, Kevin or Judith.
  How about Judith?
  Judith? Judith, please.
Judith, OK. Let's have Ian and Judith into the question room now.
  Ian, do you want the first set of questions or the second set?
  I'll go first.
First question then, Ian. For what does the letter M stand in the abbreviation MPC,
the body responsible for setting UK interest rates?
Interest rates... I wouldn't have thought it had anything to do
with Markets or Major, so...
I'll go for Monetary.
Monetary is correct, yes.
The full name is Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England.
Judith, based in the UK, the Bruges Group is a think tank
which is concerned primarily with which subject?
Oh, I'm not quite sure.
I don't think it's electoral reform.
I think it's either Europe or immigration.
I immediately thought Europe as Bruges is in Europe,
but I'm not sure that I might not switch to immigration.
  Immigration.
Immigration for the Bruges Group...
You shouldn't have switched. It's Europe. This is looking better
for Un Oeuf Is Enuf and for Ian.
You could take a 2 0 lead here.
The Stavisky Affair was a major political scandal in which country in the 1930s?
Stavisky...
You would imagine with that name it would be Russia, but...
No, I'll go for Russia.
OK, Russia, a major political scandal in the 1930s...
It wasn't Russia, no. Do you know, Judith?
  I think it's France.
  It is France, the Stavisky Affair.
The Stavisky Affair in France.
Judith faces her second question.
As they enter the House of Commons chamber, MPs traditionally touch which bit of the statues
of Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George for luck?
It depends how high up they're placed.
I don't think it would be their noses as they'd have to raise their hands
and it would be slightly cheeky.
I hope they're put high up on a plinth somewhere
  and they touch their feet.
It's probably to do with the height they're at. Feet is correct.
The feet of Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George.
All square as we go into a third question each. Here you go, Ian.
Signed in Mozambique in 2003, the Maputo Protocol was designed
to guarantee the human rights of which section of African society?
I've got a feeling it's the elderly, so I'll go for elderly.
  Elderly?
  Yeah.
  The Maputo Protocol is designed
to guarantee the human rights of women in Africa.
So a chance now for Judith.
Judith, which year's General Election is sometimes referred to as The Flapper Election?
Well, it's in the '20s because that's when flappers were.
Um, I think...
1929 would be something to do with the Depression.
I think it's 1923 after the First World War.
Other Eggheads, why "flapper"? How did that term evolve?
Originally, when women got the vote in 1918, they'd been 30 and over.
  I see.
  But about ten years later, in 1928, it was changed,
so women 21 and over could vote.
The younger women, flappers, a lot of them, so the 1929 election.
Yeah, the answer is '29, not '23.
  Oh, really?
  It was 1928 when the voting age for women was lowered
to that younger section of society as you mentioned there,
from 30 to 21. But we still haven't...
Why were they called flappers? We don't know?
I suppose it's just a frivolous kind of name
for dancing the charleston and that sort of thing.
Look at that, all square still and we go to Sudden Death again.
Ian, which candidate in the 1976 US Presidential Election was memorably compared to Bozo the Clown?
Um... What's his name?
I've...
I've no idea really, I don't think, so I'll just say...Ronald Reagan.
Ronald Reagan...
No, not Ronald Reagan.
  Do you know, Judith?
  Hubert Humphrey?
  1976 US Presidential Election.
  He was the President at the time, having taken over from Richard Nixon. He was?
  Oh, Gerald Ford.
The man they said couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time.
Judith, Robert Muldoon was the Prime Minister of which country from 1975 to 1984?
It's either Australia or Canada. My first thought was Canada.
Oh, dear, I bet it's wrong. Canada.
Wrong. It is wrong. And it wasn't Australia either.
  New Zealand?
  New Zealand, yes. Third go, yes, on that list.
We're not doing very well.
Ian, when Harold Macmillan sacked seven Cabinet Ministers
in the so called Night Of The Long Knives in 1962,
which Liberal politician said, "Greater love has no man than this,
"that he lay down his friends for his life"?
Oh...
My mind's gone blank now.
There's not many Liberal politicians at the time.
No, I can't remember.
  Judith?
  Jeremy Thorpe?
  Jeremy Thorpe.
Judith, what is the name of the Conservative MP for West Derbyshire between 1979 and 1986
who left the House of Commons and became a successful Parliamentary sketch writer for The Times?
I think that's Matthew Parris.
Matthew Parris is correct, Judith. You've won. You're in the final round.
No place for you, Ian. Come back and join your teams.
So the challengers have lost three brains from the final round. The Eggheads are all still there.
Our last subject before the final round is Food & Drink. Dave or Trish to play.
  What do you think?
  Do you want to go in the final round?
  Yeah.
  I think...
  What do you think, Ray?
You think I can do Food & Drink?
  I think he should stay to take the final.
  Take the final?
  Yeah.
  Shall I do Food & Drink?
  You'll be all right.
  I'll try Food & Drink.
  OK. Would you like to try Daphne or Kevin?
  It has to be Kevin, doesn't it?
  Everyone takes Kevin on at Food & Drink.
  It does, yes, playing regularly as ever on it.
Let's have Trish and Kevin into the question room, please.
Trish, let's get on with it. Would you like to go first or second?
I think I'd like to go first.
Good luck, Trish.
What name is commonly given to a drink containing the juice and pulp of fruit and/or vegetables?
Well, I think I do know this one because I've had one or two.
It's not smashie or slurpie. It's smoothie.
A smoothie, yes. Good start.
One to you.
Kevin, the producing countries of the so called "vodka belt" are grouped around which sea?
It would be the likes of Russia, Poland, Sweden, etc. It's the Baltic.
Yes, that's correct.
What type of liqueur is added
when making a traditional Black Forest gateau?
What type of liqueur is added
when making a traditional Black Forest gateau?
Black Forest... I don't think it's Triple Sec,
so either Tia Maria or Kirsch.
Um, I think, although it's not worked up to now,
I'm going to go down the middle and go for Kirsch.
It is the right answer, yes.
The answer is Kirsch there
in the Black Forest gateau.
Kevin, the noodle soup known as saimin is considered one of the main local dishes of which US state?
The noodle soup known as saimin   S A I M I N, all one word...
The noodle soup saimin is considered one of the main local dishes
of which US state?
It's all one word, is it? Right, OK.
Hmm...
If it had been two words, I would instantly have gone for Hawaii
because the make up of the population there,
they've had a lot of oriental immigration   Japanese and Chinese.
It could actually be a word that's more...
Because it's one word, it could be more North American Indian in origin.
Because it's noodles and you associate that with East Asian,
I'll play the percentages and go for Hawaii.
Playing the percentages correctly. Hawaii is the answer.
It's all square. Going well.
Trish, what is the Japanese term
for a sushi restaurant in which the sushi plates are placed on a rotating conveyor belt?
Well, I can't say I've ever had any of those dishes.
I don't think I'm going to go down the middle.
I think I'm going to go for gunkan zushi.
OK, gunkan zushi for one of these restaurants...
They are, in Japanese, kaiten zushi. Kaiten zushi.
So a chance for Kevin.
The tayberry is a cross between a blackberry and which other fruit?
  T A Y berry, isn't it?
  Yeah.
  I think it's the raspberry.
Blackberry and...no raspberries being blown at you
by the other Eggheads. Yes, you're into the final round. Sorry, Trish.
Going well there. You just didn't know your kaiten zushi from your gunkan zushi.
Would you both come back and join your teams?
This is what we've been playing towards   the final round which, as always, is General Knowledge.
But those of you who lost your head to heads can't take part,
so Trish, Ian, Ray and Tom from Un Oeuf Is Enuf, would you please leave the studio?
So, Dave, you're in the novelty items business. Is there much demand for whoopee cushions,
  fake dog mess?
  Absolutely.
It has not stopped at all since I started back in 1986.
Not personally, but I worked for three other wholesale companies first. It's surprising what sells.
What's your top seller then of those kind of items?
  I would suppose it's either the joke parking tickets or the imitation dog mess.
  I see.
  And you're also a bit of a comic yourself, a comic impersonator?
  Yeah.
  I used to dabble in a few voices.
  What's your favourite? What can you do?
If Clint Eastwood was here, he would say...
Well, Dermot, I know what you're thinking. Did you ask six questions or only five?
Being as this is Eggheads, the most popular quiz show in the world
and can blow your head to head clean off, you've got to ask yourself a question  
do I feel lucky? Well, do you, punk?
  I think you've got to ask yourself that. I'll put that straight back at you. Let's play the round.
Dave, you're playing to win Un Oeuf Is Enuf £15,000.
Judith, Kevin, CJ, Daphne and Chris, you're playing for something money can't buy, the Eggheads' reputation.
I'll ask each team three questions in turn, all General Knowledge, and you are allowed to confer.
Dave, is your one brain better than the Eggheads' five?
  Dave, do you want to go first or second?
  I'd like to go first.
Good luck, Dave. First question.
In the term "SWAT team", meaning a police or military unit trained for unusually dangerous situations,
for what does the letter S stand?
In the term "SWAT team", meaning a police or military unit trained
for unusually dangerous situations, for what does the letter S stand?
I used to watch the S.W.A.T show since it came on TV,
so I know it's not the first two. It is Special.
  Special Weapons And Tactics.
  Yes.
I can't give you four points for it, just the one. Special   correct.
Which football club was founded as Newton Heath LYR in 1878?
Which football club was founded as Newton Heath LYR in 1878?
  Daphne...
  That is Manchester United.
Newton Heath LYR, the founding team of Manchester United, yeah.
And it was Newton Heath LYR's colours
  that protesters against the ownership of Manchester United used.
  Green and yellow.
  One all.
Dave, the 19th century American manufacturer John Deere established a leading company in which field?
The questions are falling nicely. It's not textiles or munitions.
It is agricultural machinery.
A good one for you, a Canadian.
Plenty of Mr Deere's equipment there in Canada.
Agricultural machinery is correct.
There's a line in The Simpsons where they're criticising all the equipment
and they say, "Perhaps we should send John Deere a 'Dear John'."
Yeah, always The Simpsons. Will The Simpsons help you out with this one?
In the 1860s, where did the Morant Bay rebellion take place?
  Jamaica.
  Is it Jamaica?
It was a sort of... Yeah, I'm sure it's Jamaica.
It was not slaves, because slavery had finished by then,
but it was a workers' revolt.
  I am told it's Jamaica.
  OK, we heard that.
Yes, Jamaica is correct, Eggheads.
So, two all.
Let's hope the questions continue to fall well. Make it three with this, we hope.
In 2006, which member of the British Royal Family co founded the charity Sentebale
to help children in Lesotho in southern Africa?
In 2006, which member of the British Royal Family
co founded the charity Sentebale
to help children in Lesotho in southern Africa?
It's going to be a stab in the dark.
Um...
  I'll go with Prince William.
  Prince William?
  Yeah.
  For the Sentebale charity... It's his brother.
  Oh!
Prince Harry. Sorry, it's wrong.
Well, did Dave's luck run out there? Let's see how the Eggheads do with their third question.
The Tarpeian Rock was a steep cliff and place of execution in which city?
The Tarpeian Rock was a steep cliff
and place of execution in which city?
That was where traitors were thrown off in Rome.
In Rome, the Tarpeian Rock...
It's the right answer, Eggheads. You've won.
Well, Dave, it's always harder on your own, as I say there.
It has been done in the past and those questions fell nicely for you
until that one about Prince Harry, Prince William and Prince Charles.
  Have you enjoyed yourself today?
  I'll speak on behalf of the others.
  We have all had a terrific day.
  Some classic struggles in the head to heads.
  My boys did well.
  It could have been so different in the balance of team members in the final round.
  Yeah.
It may well have been "un oeuf" over there, but it was the other way round as it turned out.
Thanks for playing. The Eggheads have done what comes naturally to them. That winning streak continues.
You won't go home with £15,000. It rolls over to the next show.
Eggheads, congratulations. Who will beat you?
Join us next time to see if a new team of challengers have the brains to defeat the Eggheads.
