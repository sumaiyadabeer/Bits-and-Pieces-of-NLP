England's most successful off spinner in Test history despite his
side struggling against Indian on Good evening and welcome to the BBC
News. The former Radio 1DJ Dave Lee Travis has been arrested on
suspicion of sexual offences. The 67 year old was detained at his
the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. But police say the
allegations don't relate directly to Savile. Dave Lee Travis was a
regular presenter on Top of the Pops in the 1970s and 1980s and is
best known for his 25 year stint on Radio 1. Luisa Baldini reports.
That's The Rolling Stones... nearly three decades, Dave Lee
Travis was a star of BBC Radio 1. He worked across the station's
output, including the Breakfast show and hosted a programme on the
World Service. I am glad to have been a part of the... Last year,
Burmese pro democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi asked to meet him,
saying the show had given her a lifeline.
The 67 year old was arrested here at his home in Buckinghamshire at
7.45am this morning. The allegations do not directly involve
Jimmy Savile, but come under the wider scope of their investigation
involving adults. We have not heard from Mr Travis today, but he has
previously denied newspaper allegations against him. Police
launched an investigation when alleged victims started contacting
them after Jimmy Savile's crimes were exposed by an ITV documentary.
Dave Lee Travis is the fourth arrest prompted by Operation
Yewtree which is looking into offences relating to children and
adults. Gary Glitter, Freddie Starr, and Jimmy Savile's former producer
have all been questioned. Today, detectives revealed they have
identified 450 victims an increase of 150 in the past three weeks.
A regular host on Top of the Pops, tonight a repeat of the programme
from 1977 featuring Mr Travis was due to have been broadcast on BBC4.
The Corporation has decided to postpone it in the light of today's
arrest. Lord McAlpine, the former
Conservative Treasurer, wrongly accused of child abuse has told of
his shock and hurt over the false allegations which emerged following
a report on BBC News night. He said it was terrifying to find himself a
figure of public hatred. Lord McAlpine's lawyer says he expects a
compensation deal to be reached. He says he plans to sue other
broadcasters, including ITV, as well as many individuals who named
Lord McAlpine online and on Twitter and in blogs, adding it will cost
them lots of money. Newsnight never named Lord McAlpine
but that didn't stop a swirl of false accusations emerging on the
social network Twitter, even before the programme aired its allegations
about a former senior Conservative involved with child sex abuse. He's
now talked to the BBC about the damage that's been done. It gets
into your bones. It gets   it makes you angry. That's extremely bad for
to you be angry. It gets into your soul.
A week after its broadcast about abuse at this North Wales care home,
Newsnight issued a public apology, an internal report said it had
failed to carry out basic checks, like putting the claim to Lord
McAlpine. Of course they should have called me. I would have told
them exactly what they learned later on. What was that? That it
was complete rubbish. Now, after the allegations, the apology, and
the resignation of the BBC's Director General, come the
inquiries and the legal actions. It's expected that the BBC will
reach a settlement with Lord McAlpine. Lord McAlpine's lawyers
are also looking beyond the BBC to those they believe spread the slur
on social media, in particular on Twitter. They've asked experts to
identify every tweet, every re  tweet, even every deleted tweet
that put their client's name in the frame. Look, we know, in inverted
commas, who you are, we know the extent of what you have done. It's
easier to come forward and see us and apologise and arrange to settle
with us. He's referred to two public figures who drew attention
to Lord McAlpine saying he he has heard from George Monbiot
apologising but not from Sally Bercow. He is not alone against
arguing against trial by Twitter. The speed with which these
allegations can go sreurl is mass     viral is accelerated compared
with where we were before the days of Twitter and social media. Some
people have likened it to pub banter but I think that's taking it
too far. These are allegations that are published in writing. They are
in some cases Twitter account users have many thousands of followers.
The media regulator, Ofcom, is also looking at Newsnight as well as
ITV's This Morning, where Philip Schofield waved at the Prime
Minister a list of alleged paedophiles, he said he found
online. A move that drew hundreds of complaints from viewers.
Our home editor is here now. This could be quite a wake up call for
people who use social media, particularly Twitter?
relationship with mainstream media and social media has changed. We
have had a mainstream media that has, by and large, been affected by
the sort of legal situation, social, institutional conventions. It
doesn't always behave brilliantly but for the most part it's a
civilised sort of place. Then you have the online world, in
particular social media, where parts of it are like the wild west.
People don't behave to normal conventions. What we are seeing now
is it's like the railway has arrived in the wild west from the
big city. With that, the relationship has changed. People
are moving back and forward between these two worlds all the time. I
think it does change the relationship. For mainstream media,
it means they're going to have to think hard about everything they
say and do. I think for social media that's going to change,
because it's like the sheriff from the big city has arrived in the
wild west and is going to start to maintain law and order. That
relationship has changed. I think it will go further from that, what
this event today is, it's going to be held up as a moment when we
changed mainstream media, and we changed social media. Thank you.
Three people have died in southern Israel after rockets fired from
Gaza hit their apartment block this morning. They were the first
Israeli deaths since Israel killed Hamas' military chief in Gaza
yesterday. 15 Palestinians, mainly militants, but also children, have
been killed. Today, the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said
Hamas bears principal responsibility for the current
crisis. Wyre Davies reports on the escalating violence on both sides
of the border. This report contains distressing images from the start.
The body of a man held responsible by Israel for launching hundreds of
rockets from Gaza. Israel had tried to kill him many times before, and
yesterday they succeeded. At his funeral in Gaza Gaza today, the
body of Hamas' military commander was carried through the streets by
a passionate, vengeful crowd. These men are angry, determined to avenge
the assassination of Ahmed al  Jabari. Israel has already
threatened all Hamas operatives, junior and senior, to keep their
heads down in the coming days. The senior men are nowhere to be seen.
But already today the militants have fired hundreds of rockets into
Israel. Renewed attacks which Hamas today
sought to justify. It is the occupation that is fully
responsible for this open war it has started. It doesn't have the
will or the decision to end it. It will pay the price. This is
Israel's iron defence system but it couldn't cope with the sheer number
of rockets, dozens got through. Two women and a man were killed when
their house took a direct hit. This, just a few miles north of Gaza, but
tonight rockets were also being fired towards Tel Aviv, Israel's
biggest city. The Prime Minister accused Hamas of committing war
crimes. This is why my Government Government has instructed the
Israeli Defence Force to conduct surgical strikes against the
terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. And this is why Israel will
continue to take whatever action is necessary to defend our people.
There are indeed so called surgical strikes. This underground Hamas
launching site, taken out with pinpoint accuracy. But Israel's
been accused of killing innocents, too. This 11 month old died from
horrific burns when what his father says was an Israeli shell came
through the home. The father insists there were no militants or
missile sites in the area. We are civilians. Around our house, all of
them, is civilians. We don't know anyone is fighting, is in anything,
don't do anything. No one is firing. No one is resistance. All of them
is just civil civilians. Egypt is tonight reported to be trying to
arrange a truce. If that comes to nought, there are concerns that the
conflict will escalate and more civilians on both sides will suffer.
Tonight missiles have been fired from Gaza towards Tel Aviv. Katya
Adler is in Jerusalem now. How significant is this development?
Well, there were no reported casualties but it is hugely
significant. Israel's Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu,
launched his current offensive in Gaza saying he wanted to make
Israelis safer. Israel's military's been at pains to emphasise that it
has been targeting a med medium  range missiles owned by Hamas and
yet tonight these rockets reaching deeper into Israel, almost than any
other missile before launched from Gaza. So already Israelis were
feeling worried about their future, about a nuclear Iran, worries about
insecurities in the peninsula and Syria in the north. Now they're
hearing calls for a massive   Israel will feel forced to take

Eleven people died when the rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico,

who drink as little as one glass of wine a week could run the risk of
lowering their child's IQ. A new study has once again stirred the
debate about a safe alcohol limit for expectant mothers, as our
health correspondent Dominic Hughes reports.
The advice on drinking during pregnancy has shifted, a few years
ago it was no more than a small glass of wine a day. Then it
changed to no more than one or two drinks a week. Now a new report
says even that might pose risks. have good evidence that moderate
drinking can be harmful during pregnancy and it's best avoided.
Giving women the right advice on drinking during pregnancy has
proved difficult. Most people would accept drinking heavily is not good
for the developing baby. But evidence on the effects of moderate
drinking has been patchy. What are the details of this report? The
study looked at more than 4,000 mothers and children and some of
those mothers were found to be genetically less able to process
alcohol in their bodies. The children of mothers in this group
who drank as little as say one or two glasses of wine per week,
scored slightly lower on IQ tests than the children of mothers who
didn't drink anything at all. surprised at the level of damage
that you can do just by drinking a small amount, certainly throughout
the pregnancy. If you take such a responsibility to have a child, I
think it's very important to not to drink at least nine months.
Department of Health in England says it will always take note of
new evidence, so this report means the current advice to women could
change again. But some doctors say women shouldn't worry too much over
Be a bit careful about how much alcohol you take but if you have
had a drink, please do not worry that you have harmed your child.
This research seems to show that in some families, moderate alcohol
consumption can make a small difference in intelligence tests in
children but lots of different factors influence a child's

After a week of secret talk and closed door meetings, China finally
has its new leader who will run the huge country for the next ten years.
George Alagiah is in the Chinese capital for us now.
Hello from Beijing, where the man who will run this global superpower
was finally unveiled today. Xi Jinping will rule the country which
has a fifth of the world's population and could become the
biggest economy while he is in charge, but he faces huge
challenges, too. In his first speech today, Mr Xi admitted the
Communist Party is in danger of losing touch with its own people.
Welcome to the door of a new Chinese era, the Xi Jinping era,
the team and lead in charge of the world's rising superpower. Led by
Xi Jinping, the seven men will now rule over one fifth of humanity.
Incredibly, neither we nor China's 1.3 billion people know much about
them, what they will do for China's future. Immediately it felt
different. The Communist Party's new general secretary, more relaxed,
confident and plain speaking. The problems among our
party members of corruption, taking bribes, being out of touch with the
people, undue emphasis on formalities and bureaucratism must
be addressed with great efforts. Xi, on the left, has been groomed
for power. His father helped lead the Communist revolution and
observing it close up for decades, the American Sidney Rittenberg.
is not going to be a dominant leader like Chairman Mao. He would
have to create a consensus in the leading body and that will not be
easy to do. Mr Xi will have to share power with the other six men
elevated to the apex of the party today. Some are hardliners. Major
reforms seem unlikely. But change is exactly what many believe China
needs. This town was when Xi Jinping had his first important job
as a young official. Now economic growth is slowing and people's
demands of the new leader of rising. Zu Xin Schezuan is 69. He survives
by selling soap he makes at home. He wants Mr Xi to spend more on
health care and education, but it will require enormous investment.
Zong Qinghou remembers the young are Mr Xi and hope he makes use of
China's growing military. He should be prepared to fight our enemies
abroad. People may die but we should beat our enemies down.
Avoiding conflict with a rise in China is one of America's
priorities. Xi Jinping now controls the world's biggest army and a
nuclear arsenal. He is very candid. He is not somebody threw sticks to
talking points. He engages. He will be somebody that we will be able to
deal with in a future. China's new leader on his very first day is
already bringing a change of style. The unknown is whether he will be
able to bring a change of substance, too.
China has seen a remarkable economic transformation over the
last 30 years. Hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty.
But there are real fears that this miracle may not last. I have been
speaking to China's richest man who grew up in poverty. He told me the
gap between rich and poor is a huge problem and something the new
leadership will have to tackle. Guangzhou, a retreat for centuries
and home to a new kind of empire. This is the headquarters of the
Wahaha soft drinks company. Communism and capitalism sit side
by side. Zong Qinghou is worth up to $20 billion. This delegation is
from the faraway it Sichuan province. On both sides of the
table, they know that too many are missing out on China's economic
Miller    economic miracle. Lots are still poor,
only a small number are rich. The wealth gap is a huge problem
and has triggered social dissatisfaction. He grew up in
poverty, a rags to riches story if ever there was one. His first
business was selling ice lollies from a bicycle 25 years ago. Even
now, he eats in the staff canteen and lives on $20 a day.
Or I spend less than my workers. I believe in a simple
life. We give money to charity, so even though I am rich, I will not
be hated for it. The rich must earn respect. But as it turns out, the
frugality gene does not run in the family. We were told the
Lamborghini outside belongs to his daughter. The company has 66
factories across the country. This line alone produces 30,000 bottles
of tea every hour. Successful as Zong Qinghou is, his business
empire he epitomises China's mass  production model of economic growth
but there are limits to that. There will always be someone trying to
compete on cost, so now there are calls for China to get creative.

possible that the likes of Vega Wang represent a new generation and

London's triumphant Olympic opening ceremony, is warning that the
future of the theatre is at risk because of funding cuts across
England. The film director and producer says he worries about
where the next generation of actors, set designers and producers will
come from if the cuts continue. Will Gompertz reports.
The opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games, made in London,
forged in the regions. Danny Boyle was in London today to express his
concerns about the future of theatre in the regions. The theatre
is so quiet and gentle in the corner and it deserves to be heard
much more because it sustains local communities in an immediate sense,
which is very positive for local economies, but it also gives a
sense of belonging that can result in big expressions, like the Open
in ceremony. This is the main stage of the West Yorkshire Playhouse,
but not only had they had central government cuts but they have also
had local government cuts. Add to that the fact it is much harder to
raise philanthropic guests outside of London and you have something
approaching a perfect storm. The theatre's boss thinks Arts Council
England is partly to blame for investing too much in London.
should be more invested in the regions because the regions are
where the artistic practice is developing, and we can then pass
those creative people and those managers into London and the
commercial sector and the film industry. Her next production is
wind In the Willows. It needs to bring in some much needed cash
because the Arts Council says it will not be able to help. We do not
have spare money that we can either start filling in for local
authority funding or start moving money around the country, we are
just not in a position to do that. Pitman Painters is an example how
investment in local talent can pay dividends. It was originally
produced in Newcastle before going on to be a hit in Broadway and the
West End. The challenge now for local theatre is how does it repeat
this with less money? Time for a look at the weather
forecast. Nothing too dramatic but it has
