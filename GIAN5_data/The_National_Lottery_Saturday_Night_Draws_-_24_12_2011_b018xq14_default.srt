Rollover and here to bring us all some festive cheer, its Scott
Mills! Thanks Alan, welcome everyone to Lottery HQ and of
course happy Christmas Eve! I hope you're all ready for the big day.
Presents wrapped, turkey marinating in a festive jus and a large glass
of mulled wine in hand? Check, check and check. Well that's good
to hear Alan, but I was of course referring to our viewers who are no
doubt poised and ready to become last minute Christmas winners, with
tonight's draws. But before we get to that can I just say what an
amazing night last night! 25 brand new millionaires created all in one
evening with EuroMillions UK Millionaire Raffle. It must have
felt like Christmas coming early for all those lucky winners. And on
that note, I think it's time we made some more tonight with
Thunderball. Okay Alan, it's over to you. Release those Christmas Eve
balls please Matt. The machine is Excalibur.
Matched with the first 5 numbers drawn? Matt, are you ready for
tomorrow? Yeah, can't wait. Are we ready now? Yeah, we are
indeed. Good luck. Which is to be the first
one to appear tonight? There is the If you have won the first five, you
have won �5,000. However if you match one more, that
is �5 ,000, turning into �500,000. So, good luck. Here are the
games you help to fund thousands of good causes all over the UK that do
incredible work. Here is Alan to tell you a little more.
More than �27 billion has been raised for good causes since the
lottery began in 1994. Across the past year, it has raised over �30
million a week. National Lottery players raise �30
million each week for good causes? In 2011 over 19,000 grants were
awarded to a huge range of projects that make a massive difference to
people and places in your area. It has broadened his horizons and
learned him many new skills. Funding is awarded to all kinds of
projects, including arts, sports, heritage, health and Voloshin tear
projects. Every year, the National Lottery
Awards show the impact that the organisations make to the local
communities. This year was no difference.
It was great for the National Lottery to make this building
possible and of course to all of you who voted for us. Thank you
very much. None of this is done without you,
the National Lottery players. you, National Lottery! If you want
to know more about funding for good causes, go to the website and

the excitement that has been building, that is about to come to
a satisfying conclusion. It is time for Lotto! OK. Alan, a Rollover
font tonight. So, the most festive voice, how much is in the jackpot?
It's been estimated at a cool �6.5 million.
You can buy a lot of mince pies with that. OK, let's do this.
