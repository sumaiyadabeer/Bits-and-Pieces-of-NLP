Hello, good afternoon. You are watching the Sunday Politics for
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Coming up today: why a senior Yorkshire
Tory is fighting to give the authorities more power to monitor
our internet activity. And we find out wide two of our
councils have bend cost cutting measures are to share a chief 
executive. Our guest today is Meg Munn and
Kris Hawkins. We're going to kick of with this snooping around where
it the Government wants to give the authorities more power to keep an
eye and as on the internet. Are you in favour of this? It is difficult
to tell because they are complex. We need a balance between security
and liberty. We know that there are worrying crimes whether it is
internet crimes of child abuse or terrorism where we do need powers
to be in place but equally, because the Government has not been clear
about this, we have people worried about whether their privacy is
going to be invaded. Kris, some Conservatives on the right are
opposed to this idea, of weirdies stand? I think we have to do
something. The last piece of legislation was 2006, it was the
year before the iPhone came out. We now have over a billion people on
Facebook and a huge increase in information over the internet.
There are some really important issues around child protection,
fighting serious crime and defeating terrorism. This
potentially adds another arm to the police's resources. Opposition to
Davis. That some kit    but some police officers say that it will be
an important part in tackling online sex offenders.
This is discreet and I would rather do it indoors. This raid carried
out by Lincolnshire police this week was part of a national
operation to crack down on those possessing indecent images of
children. The Government wants to make it easier for up officers to
monitor suspected offenders. They want to stay one step ahead of
paedophiles. From my perspective as a police officer and an operation
or reader I'm welcome any greater powers and increased options around
this form of horrible criminality. As technology gets more
sophisticated, the criminals themselves who shared these
horrible images of children actually being abused, as they get
better, we need to get better. proposed communications data bill
would allow it the police and intelligence agencies to monitor
our internet activity including e  mails and social networking as well
as phone calls. Details would be stored for up to a year. However,
authorities would only be able to access the nature of communication
is not the content. Officials here at the Home Office say that
accessing communications data is vital, not just for apprehending
sex offenders, but also in the vast majority of terrorism cases. They
denied these new proposals are snoopers' charter, but others
disagree. The former shadow home secretary David Davis is a leading
critic of the proposals. He has been taking part in an on line
question and answer section with Web users who are worried about
their privacy. This gives a huge picture of people's lives. It is an
intrusion of people's privacy and will not actually help catch
tourism's    terrorists at all. If you are at terrorist, you get round
it with a pre paid phone, using internet cafe, you use a proxy
server. He used false credentials. This will gathered data on 60
million innocent people, not catch criminals, and that is why I am
against it. The proposals will be scrutinised by Parliament before
legislation is introduced but already the battle lines have been
drawn between those who believe any new law would help fight against
crime and those who believe it is a licence to snoop.
We have also been joined by James Baker from the No 2 IT campaign who
is opposed to this bill. You heard that from a senior police officer
in Lincolnshire. He says this new Bill will help them catch sex
offenders, Heidi who argue against that? If it was just about sex
offenders and tourists that would be one thing. If so, why does it
allow it provisions for the Government to snoop on us. This
isn't just a Bell about fighting crime at this is a Bill that will
please millions of law abiding citizens and the UK it under
unprecedented levels of surveillance without a warrant.
you heard there that this is not going to affect the content of e 
mails. Police officers cannot read the content, it is about the
communication and there are going and coming of those messages.
can access that through another piece of legislation. What this
bill includes is all of your browsing henge and    history and
anything that you've looked up. All of your information that we will be
accessible. That will be for hundreds of public bodies including
the food standards agency not just the police. Why do the food
standards agency need to know what I'm saying on Facebook? The
communications data includes all of their location of data. Every time
you move about with your mobile phone the Government will be able
to track where you are. To suggest that communications data isn't a
problem is very misleading. You can tell a huge amount from it. You can
build up a huge picture of people's lives. Technology is changing all
the time, don't they it crime fighting bodies have to stay one
step ahead? Nobody has been able to read every letter that you have
sent to someone. So to suggest that any piece of technology requires
this legislation is very misleading and what this Bill does his place
those forms of communications and a new surveillance powers. So if you
send a parcel now the Government will be able to snoop on that
information. David Cameron said that we were in danger of living in
a controlled state, why has he changed his mind? The Labour Party
were talking about her central database where all this information
was stored. At the moment most providers retain some of the
information that we create. Most of the information it be great. What
it there Government is suggesting, it is a draft bill by the way, that
the information is retained for 12 months. And if someone wants to see
the content of that they must go to the Home Secretary with the warrant
and she must then sign that of to get it that access. There is huge
amounts of data storage, it is about making sure that that data is
secure, not controlled by the Government or the police, it is
what the providers and it is at being asked to be retained the for
12 months. Meg Munn, the Labour Government was criticised for
trying to control many aspects of our lives. People do not want the
Big Brother state, do they? No they do not. I think what we're seeing
is the Conservative ministers are finding out that when they get into
Government and get into these issues it is not quite as simple as
David Cameron believed that in at 2009. It is a very complex issue
and one that, quite rightly James is setting out, needs to be looked
at properly. Parliamentary scrutiny of this is crucial. The key thing
that we would all agree on is that people should not just be able to
access this information. It should be on the basis of a warrant and
that should have the proper judicial oversight. A James, how
were you going to convince these MPs to back your campaign? Really
why would ask MPs and everyone else is to look at the warrants. Who is
signing of the warrants? Is that the Home Secretary or is it someone
independent from the Government? What we have said is that you need
magistrates and are just three there. The need to see whether it
is proportionate and whether it is a terrorist or paedophile case or
whether it is someone snooping into our private lives unnecessarily. It
is very simple, while money to look at how the access the data and what
permissions they have. interesting debate I suspect over
the coming months on this one. In order to cope with tighter
budgets the Government has been encouraging councils to share
services. Many areas serve    save taxpayers' money but in two
councils in our area at the abandoning moves to share a chief 
executive saying that the experiment has not worked.
These made history years ago when they were operated jointly. They
also shared at chief executive and a team of the most senior and
highest paid officers. But that between these two councils and that
relationship has fallen apart. That is despite savings of well over a
million pounds. The problem according to the leader of Richmond
share council is that it was not clearly hammered out how they would
do with their neighbours. politicians in our partner
authority felt that we were spending    he was spending along
with his senior managers too much time attending to business over
here in at Richmond Show. That is at the root of why we are at
looking at some other arrangements for a shared services. It has been
closely monitored here by think  tanks and pressure groups to seek
shared services as a major tool to saving public money. They have to
have a clear understanding of the division of hours. How many days as
a chief executive going to spend in each council. I think that has been
their problem in North Yorkshire. Other councillors that were
entering into these agreements will have to make sure that the
necessary arrangements are in place to stop these deals collapsing
completely. We started this in April last year. 100 miles south to
Chesterfield. Hear those last lessons have been learned. These
councils are meeting with the chief executive that they share. After
one year of this they cannot understand why more councils are
not going down this cost saving route. I think people are not brave
enough. I think they are frightened. It is a big step. It is a difficult
decision to make. You have to take people with you and you have to
entrust. People are frightened to go the extra mile. After the first
year at we have achieved practically �1 million worth of
savings. That is a million pounds that we are going to have to take
from frontline services. Around two dozen smaller district councils
around England and out sharing chief executive and senior officers.
That is fewer than might be expected with public spending so
squeezed. Here in Derbyshire it is a move where everybody needs to
know exactly what they're getting. Kris Hopkins, you are a former
leader of Bradford Council, is it reasonable for more authorities to
share back office services? It is not as reasonable, it is absolutely
essential. We should not just limited to councils either. Where
it is appropriate I think NHS chief executives should share between
councils also. There's a whole range of services that can be
utilised with one chief executive. The �1 million that they have saved
that they were talking about there. When you try to restructure her
daily services huge amounts of resources and less money is
available. It is really important that you find savings there. Being
clear about what you want to achieve and making sure that the
individuals are accountable is really important. We have to
explode those ways and I think it is working in one area and not
someone else. I am sure they will explore why it has failed and the
Wanderer dead. Cheeks executives earn much more money than most   
chief executives. Some more than the Prime Minister. It is
reasonable than? A what I think we saw their is whether the
politicians at the top can work together. It might just be that
those two areas were similar sorts of areas where it worked. I do
wonder whether the change of leadership at politically at the
top, if that were to happen, would be shared the same views. Or is
something major happened in one area at what they council be happy
to lose their chief executive to work for a long time in another
area. It is not straight forward but many things can be done. What
we really have to look that is where there are proper communities
of interest and for you can work together. I think Kris was talking
about the NHS. That begs the question of why under the terrible
reorganisation we got there we got more bodies with more leaders
rather than bringing services together when it does make sense to
have one leader. We will have to come back to that on another day.
A let us get more news from the rest of the week now.
Proposals to axe some of their Yorkshire regiments historic
battalions are being described as at done deal by some of the
region's MPs. Patrick Mercer says that their it cuts might be
confirmed in early July. Calls are coming for a cross party group to
challenge the Defence Secretary over the cuts.
More than 60 of his workers could lose their jobs in newly privatised
sections of Lincolnshire police. It comes just two months after 500 of
his staff transferred to another area. Over the coming years I would
be very surprised if there were not more job losses.
And this rail link was politely received through gritted teeth by
the Prime Minister. Well they at gut    Government go ahead well
with the high speed train? I grip over the enthusiastic endorsement
at the that is important to get on board this high speed rail
revolution. A will come back to high speed rail.
First, Kris Hopkins, you are a former member of the army. The army
cuts story, potentially a Yorkshire regiment losing its battalion, what
you know about that? The Duke of Wellington's Regiment is the third
Battalion. It is deployed in Afghanistan and have had some
serious casualties. There is a lot of people at home are very
concerned at this moment in time about the welfare of their loved
ones. I think the speculation and the guesswork that has been picked
out by certain individuals this week, I think, is fairly appalling.
You mean you Conservative colleague. I think there is a range of can is
derivative and other MPs who have spoken out. There are people
leaving their lives on the line at the moment. There are people
concerned about their loved ones. To put out this work and
speculation about hunches about something that might happen in the
future, that is not acceptable. I went to the defence secretary and
specifically asked him if the third battalion has been targeted it is
going to be axed. He said that no decision had been made about any
unit in the British Army. So to put this into this arena when people
are in such fearful situation for their loved ones at this moment. To
talk about speculation, will it go? That is wrong. And I am fairly out
raged about what has been said. Patrick Moser is not here to defend
himself. Meg Munn, can you understand the need for cutbacks in
the army? Of course every area of public service has had to be looked
at. As you will know the Labour Party has had lots of concerns
about the way the defence review was carried out in the way it is
going forward. As Kris Wright be said this is not something that
make a political party football at all. The defence should come out
and say exactly what is happening and what they expect to happen and
be clear about it so that people know where they stand. This is a
bit of a pattern where the information has not been picked out
in the right way in the first place and what you then see is their
Government running to catch up. That is not quite right. The
Government has said that it will issue in weeks to come clear lines
on which units will be removed and the numbers that will actually have
to be removed. It is the guesswork now when people at busy fighting
for at great cost at this moment in time. Those men are still extremely
brave and they are risking their lives. It is wrong to speculate.
that time we have left the high  speed train. The Prime Minister
is what we hear it will cost. Is it money well spent? There is a huge
dependency on the public sector in the further and North. The way we
change that is what better lines of communication and transport is one
of those. At the end of the day, there are hundreds of people that
are trying to get into a few seats. We're going to increase the
capacity and ideally we are going to speed up the process. More to
the point, will be spent a lot of money doing it which was under
local businesses. Money well spent, neck?    Meg? The governor needs to
set out its overall transport policy. How are we and goods and
services going to get around the country. It is not just about one
area of Transport it is about looking at all of them is. There in
a mess around airports. People need to know so that they can plan their
