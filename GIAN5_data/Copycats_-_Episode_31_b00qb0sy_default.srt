Wahey!
  Hello!
  Hello!
Welcome to Copycats, the game show where copying is good.
  Well, as long as you're good at copying.
  That is very true, Mark.
Yes, the aim of the game is to claim as many points as you possible can,
because only one family
can win today's special Copycat secret prize!
  Oooh!
  Ooh, indeed.
  Ooh, indeedy. Shall we meet the families?
  Let's do it.
OK, first up, we've got Andrew's family from Glasgow!
We've also got Georgie's family from Surrey!
  I like that!
  Fantastic!
  It's lovely to have you. Welcome to Copycats.
  Absolutely.
Andrew, as the head of your family,
  please introduce the rest of the gang.
  On my right here is Stuart,
  and he's a football fanatic.
  Ah!
On my left here is Ewan.
He's read over 500 books
and I think he's going to be the next world genius.
  Taking over the world, Ewan?
  Maybe.
On my right back here is my mum, Helen.
She is amazing at making meals, but hates water slides.
This is Alison, Ewan's mum.
She's always up for a laugh.
This is Justin. He's amazing at tennis and is very funny.
Good luck, Andrew's family. It's great to have you on the show.
Nice one. OK, over here, we've got Georgie's family.
  Georgie, introduce your team.
  This is my dad, Roy. He does karate.
This is my little brother, Sully. He does monster impressions.
  This is my friend's mum, Sue. She does a sad puppy dog face.
  Aw!
  Aw!
This is my friend, Franny. She does a mean hot dog impression.
This is my mum, Sarah. She sneezes like a duck.
Nice work! OK, first thing we need to do
is decide who will be playing the first game.
The way we're going to do that   Mark is going to mime something.
The first team to correctly identify what Mark is going to mime
will get to choose whether they play first or second.
  OK, do you know what you're going to mime?
  I do.
  Go for it.
Watch very carefully.
HORN BEEPS Oh! Andrew?
Weightlifting?
It is indeed weightlifting!
Nice work there, Andrew.
You get to choose whether you play first or second.
  What do you want to do?
  We shall go first.
  First! OK!
Let's play Copycats!
This first round is called Mime Time.
Justin, I'm going to get you to pick one of these cards.
You then have ten seconds to mime the action
for the next person and so on down the line.
Good luck. Close the doors!
Close the doors!
  Red, silver or blue?
  I'll go for silver.
  Silver.
OK, have a read.
OK, your ten seconds start now!
These are good. Good acting.
WHISTLE BLOWS OK, your turn.
Nice.
Take a good look, Alison.
WHISTLE BLOWS Alison, your turn.
Stuart's laughing. Ha ha ha! All right, Stuart, your turn.
Good.
This is good.
WHISTLE BLOWS All right, finally, Helen, your turn.
Take a good look, Andrew.
WHISTLE BLOWS All right!
For a maximum of 50 points, Andrew, any idea what Helen was doing there?
I think she could have been punching pads in different places,
  so, punching pads.
  A good guess, but not what we're looking for.
We're now playing for 40 points. Helen, what was Stuart doing?
I'm going to try playing table tennis.
He wasn't playing table tennis.
Stuart, what was Alison doing?
Swatting flies?
She was! Yeah!
Nice work!
  Well done, guys, you get yourselves 30 points!
  Yay!
Andrew's family did rather well there.
Good start, 30 points.
Sarah, put you at the beginning.
  Any good at miming?
  I'll do my best.
  The best of luck. Close the doors!
Close the doors!
  OK, Sarah, if you'd like to pick either blue or red.
  Blue, please.
OK, have a look at that.
Good luck, Sarah.
Your ten seconds start...
now. Open the doors.
  I think Georgie's got it.
Ha ha! Brilliant!
Keep watching, Roy.
This is good copying, guys.
Some excellent acting skills there.
Sully, for the maximum of 50 points, what was Roy miming there?
Eating hot chillies, peppers.
We are going to give you that!
It was actually eating hot food,
  and to be honest...
  Chillies are pretty hot.
They're pretty hot.
Congratulations, guys.
  You get yourselves the full 50 points!
  Yeah!
And that also means that you guys won that round,
so you now get to choose whether you play or pass on the next game.
If you do decide to do the challenge and complete it successfully,
50 points go to your family, but if you do it and you fail,
25 points go to Andrew's family.
  Georgie, pass or play?
  Play.
  They're going to play!
Georgie's family are about to play Basket Heads.
OK, this is the aim of the game.
The people on the podiums will throw a ball into the basket heads.
The basket heads will then walk on their skilts   skilts?   stilts,
  come over here to the big basket   hiya, all right?
  Hiya.
  Cool.
And you drop it in like that!
Now, Georgie's family, 50 points will be yours
if you manage to get 15 balls into the basket before the time runs out.
If not, 25 points will automatically go to Andrew's family
  for doing absolutely...
  Nowt!
Good luck, guys.
In three, two, one,
get throwing!
Yes!
Not bad, not bad.
Yes!
  Good shot!
  Yes!
This is excellent play.
There's no telling.
  Come on, guys!
  Come on, guys, come on!
Yeah!
Yeah! Nice one, guys!
Wow! This is excellent.
You're doing great! Doing really well, keep it up.
That's ridiculous!
Hey!
Yes!
  Go, go, go!
  Oooh!
Yes!
You're doing so well!
Oh, that one went straight in!
Come a bit closer, guys!
  Ten, nine, eight,
  seven...
  Go, go, go!
..four, three, two, one!
Yeah!
That was amazing!
Now, can I just confirm that one of these balls was thrown into it?
We can confirm it and I'm afraid it doesn't count.
So, from now on, 15 balls in the air, you guys get the 50 points.
Best of luck. One!
Two! Three! Four!
Five! Six! Seven!
Eight! Nine! Ten! Eleven!
  Twelve!
  Oh, no!
  Thirteen!
  No!
  Fourteen! That's it!
Oh, no!
You're having a laugh, aren't you?
Ah, guys, I'm so sorry. That means you don't get the 50 points,
but 25 points do go to Andrew's team.
OK, so the overall scores are
Georgie's team are on 50 points
but slightly in the lead with 55 points, it's Andrew's family!
This next round is called Quick On The Draw.
Yeah!
OK, this is how it's going to work. Helen, you will pick a card
You will draw whatever is on that card for the player next to you,
  and next to you and so on down the line. Understand?
  I do.
OK, close the doors!
Close the doors!
Helen, if you'd like to pick red, blue or silver.
  Silver, thank you.
  Silver. Have a look at that.
OK. Thank you.
Good luck to you. Your ten seconds start...
now. Open the door.
OK, Andrew, keep watching, mate.
Ooh!
Good copying so far.
OK. Stop drawing, please.
OK, now, Ewan, for 50 points, mate,
  what was Alison drawing?
  A pair of scales?
It's not what I've got on my card.
OK, open the door, please, for 40 points. Alison?
I thought it was a pair of scales, BUT I think it is a telephone.
  Yes!
  Yeah!
  Well done!
Well done! 40 points!
Close the doors!
Close the doors!
  Pick a card.
  Thank you.
  All right, the best of luck. You've got ten seconds,
starting from...
now!
Oh, good.
All right.
Take a good look, Sully.
Ah!
  Yeah!
  All right!
Sue, for 50 points, what do you think that is?
It looks like a supersonic ice lolly to me.
  But I don't think it's right.
  You're right.
It's not right. Sorry about that. We're now playing for 40 points.
Sully, what do you reckon Roy's drawn there?
Christmas tree.
That's not the answer we're looking for.
All right, we're playing for 30 points.
Roy, what has Franny drawn there?
Sand castle?
  It's not a sand castle.
  It's not. Sorry.
  All right, what do you reckon Sarah's drawn there?
  A mountain?
  It's not.
  It's not a mountain.
OK, right, we're playing for ten points.
Sarah?
A broken log?
It's not a broken log.
  Georgie, do you want to tell everybody what it is?
  Iceberg.
  It's an iceberg!
  An iceberg! Ah!
Well, sadly, you guys get zero points there,
and that now means that Andrew's family, you guys won that round.
So you get to choose whether you play or pass on the next game.
If you do the challenge and you complete it successfully,
50 points will go to your family.
But if you fail, 25 points go to Georgie's family.
So, Andrew, as head of the family, are you going to play or pass?
  We shall play.
  All right!
Andrew's family have decided to play Big Foot Bangers!
I know what you're saying here. I think, me, you, Ian,
could take over the world.
New duo, Mark and Ian. Has a nice ring to it, I think.
Stop messing about, will you?
  We've got a show to do.
  Ian!
Guys, this is how Big Foot Bangers works.
It's very, very simple.
All you've got to do is burst all these balloons
in the time limit using your big, giant feet.
  I hope you're proud of yourself.
  I am.
50 points are up for grabs if you complete the course, but remember,
if you fail, 25 points will go to the other family. OK.
  Three, two, one...
Get banging!
  Left foot!
  Eh, good start.
Yeah! Give it a bang!
Right! One, two, three.
Oh, easy, easy!
  Left!
  Right!
  One, two, three, left!
  Right!
  Right!
  Right!
Left! One, two three!
Good work, guys, good work.
One, two, three, right!
  Right!
  Left!
One, two, three, right!
Left, one, two, three.
Left!
One, two, three, left!
Right!
OK, here we go.
Watch out! Move back!
That's it! That's it!
Right!
  One, two, three, right!
  Come on, lads!
Yeah!
One, two, three, left.
One, two, three, right!
One, two, three, left!
Yay!
One, two, three, right!
  Right!
  Right!
One, two, three, left!
One, two, three, right!
  Nice!
  One, two, three, left!
One, two, three, right!
Nine! Eight!
  Come on, guys.
  Seven! Six!
Five! Four! Three!
Two! One!
Oh! Guys!
That was so close!
Two balloons left!
As I said before, you needed to get them all to get the full 50 points,
so that means Georgie's family get themselves 25 points!
OK. So the scores at the end of that round are
Georgie's team on 75,
but slightly in the lead,
Andrew's family with 95 points!
This is the Sound Round. Georgie, you're going to pick a tune.
You will then recreate it using this instrument.
  Yeah!
  That was really good! That was awesome!
  Go on, tell them.
  OK. Close the doors!
Close the doors!
Could everybody apart from Georgie please put your headphones on.
Georgie, I've got three cards here. Pick a card. Silver, red or blue.
  Silver.
  Silver. Take a look. Do you think you know that song?
  No.
  Don't worry. We're going to play it,
so listen to the melody so you can repeat it. OK? Here we go.
Have you heard of that before?
Yeah, you know it! OK, the best of luck.
You've got ten seconds, Georgie, starting from now!
I think Sue got that straightaway.
BUZZER Nice! OK.
NO SOUND Oh, gosh!
Keep going!
BUZZER OK. Sarah, your turn.
Roy, for 50 points, what do you think Franny was playing there?
Um...Happy Birthday?
It wasn't Happy Birthday.
We're playing for 40 points. Franny, what was Sarah playing there?
Um...Copycats?
  It wasn't the Copycats theme tune.
  But thank you.
  Sarah, what was Sully playing?
  When The Saints Came Marching In?
  It wasn't that.
  Unfortunately.
  All right, we're playing for 20 points.
  Sully, what was Sue playing?
  I don't know.
  No idea?
  No.
  All right, then, OK.
  We're playing for ten points.
  It was The Birdie Song.
  Yeah!
Well, eh, ten points are better than no points.
Close the doors!
Close the doors!
Could you pick red or blue, please, Stuart?
  I think I'll have blue, please.
  Have a look at that.
  Have you heard that before?
  No.
  That's OK,
because we're going to play it into the studio right now.
Do you know it now?
What a song!
  Good luck, Stuart.
  Thanks.
Your ten seconds start now. Open the doors. Headphones off.
Tricky one! Tricky one!
OK, Alison, have a good hard think. What was Ewan playing there?
I'm sure it's a theme tune.
  The Weakest Link.
  Unfortunately, that is not the correct answer.
Please open the doors, for 40 points, Ewan?
What was Justin playing there, mate?
  No idea?
  No.
  All right, mate, no worries. OK, open the door. For 30 points?
Hot Love, Baby, Tonight?
  It's not, unfortunately, sorry.
  No? OK, I'm not surprised.
  For 20 points?
  Star Wars?
Star Wars! It wasn't Star Wars.
OK, finally, for ten points, open the door. Helen?
I'm afraid I'm guessing too. Theme tune from Newsround?
It isn't. Stuart, please, tell us what the correct answer was.
Beat It by Michael Jackson.
Unfortunately,
  Andrew's family, you get no points for that.
  Never mind.
OK, the overall scores are:
Georgie's family have got 85 points,
but slightly in the lead with 95 points  
it's still all to play for   Andrew's family!
Oh! It's very close as we go into our final round,
Hamster Ball Havoc.
This is the big finale.
Whichever team has the most points at the end of this game
will go home with that fantastic family prize.
Ooh! Indeedy! Our families need to go through this obstacle course
as quickly as they possibly can   good waving  
but make sure that they don't knock any of these balls over.
Every time they do, 25 points gets deducted from their overall score.
100 points will go to the first team that cross this finish line.
Georgie's team are in the orange hamster balls,
  Andrew's team are in the purple balls.
  Good luck, teams.
Three, two, one,
go, go, go, go!
It's Georgie's dad, Roy, setting off first for the oranges,
and it's team captain Andrew for the purples.
There's not enough room for two balls through there,
and that's the result! 25 points off both teams' score.
Oh! And to make matters worse for the purples, Andrew is down!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Nothing in this race.
They cross together at the halfway stage on this first lap.
Georgie's dad's style is very robotic, I feel.
I agree, but quite effective, because they're still together.
Andrew just getting the better of that lap and hands over to Justin.
Roy finishes just behind and that's captain Georgie for the oranges.
Oh! And Georgie takes out that same pillar!
That's 25 points away from their overall score.
Justin trundling along nicely. Now, where will he meet Georgie?
Right there. Ouch!
Georgie pounding along the back straight, trying to make up time.
Justin flies around the pillars to hand over to Stuart for the last lap.
It's those dreaded pillars again!
Both teams take a ball out each.
Georgie finishes her lap
and that's Sully on the last leg for the oranges.
Stuart in the back straight, a big lead over Sully.
Bounce off time!
Oh, Stuart almost goes there. Can he stay on his feet and win the race?
Nearly there! Nearly there!
  Nearly there!
  He's almost there
and he crosses the line for a superb win for the purples.
  What a great race!
  Good race.
  Brilliant.
OK, right, Georgie's team, sadly, you guys came second in that race,
so you don't get the 100 points
and you did knock over four of the balls.
Those are 25 points each deducted off your final score.
That means that your final score is
zero. Sorry, guys. Sorry.
  It was a good race, though.
  Quite right.
Now, Andrew's family, you did win the race, so that's 100 points,
but you did knock over two of the balls.
So Andrew's family's final total is...
145 points!
Congratulations, guys!
Let's take a look at what you've won.
Extreme sports can't get any better
than this whitewater rafting prize for all your team.
Ride the waves on this white knuckle experience.
Nice one, guys. I'm sure you'll have a great time.
  It's the end of the show! Can you believe it?
  Oh!
  Bye!
  Bye!
Join us next time on Copycats!
