Do you want one?
Sure?
It's not so bad.
Something to look forward to?
Don't think about all the things you will or won't be able to eat,
think about all the things you'll be able to do!
But eating is my favourite thing to do!
You're a one. You know that, don't you?
That'll be Tibor.
He's forgotten I have the day off, and he's wondering where I am. Sweet!
Oh, hey. Sleep well?
Not really. I kept re working my piece in my sleep.
I'm so confused now, I can't remember what the real one's like,
and I'm not sure if it's any good.
  I'm sure it's fantastic.
  Well, anything's an improvement on the rubbish of day one.
You're really talented, you'll have more than made up for day one.
  You just need to put all your troubles aside and stay focussed for the next few days.
  Yeah.
If only English and media weren't on the same day I might have a chance.
  Same day? Nasty. When?
  Next week.
You'll be surprised what you can cram in last minute.
How do you think I passed my nursing exams?
Anyway, you'll have the place to yourself, peace and quiet.
Me and Jimmi are going away for the weekend, so be no distractions.
You're all right being here alone?
I'm almost a grown up, remember?
Well, it's not till Friday.
  Things might have blown over by then.
  Do you think?
If not, we'll just cancel.
No, don't do that!
Anyway, if I'm not back home by then, being here will
give me a chance to get my head down,
get some serious revision done.
I might be able to help you with that. I have a secret weapon.
Which is?
I'm not off until six, so it'll have to be a late one.
  Think you'll be up to it?
  I'm not having the operation today.
'Well, I know that, but maybe there'll be tests or something.'
They just want to go through everything now a date's been set.
I'm going to have to prepare myself now it's really happening.
It'll be over before you know it, and well worth it.
Can't wait to get you on that golf course.
You'll have to watch out, I may not be a fast walker, but I'm a fast learner.
You'll be fitter in no time.
  Slim and fit.
  Ooh! Can't wait.
Hey, I'd better get going.
Should at least leave on time, though Jim says the traffic's rubbish already.
I'll come round when I knock off.
  Good luck with the traffic. See you then.
  Good luck with the doctors. See you love.
I've got Mrs Taylor here. She's got a high temperature and chills.
  Should she call an ambulance?
  No! Tell her to come in.
  She's 91.
OK, I'll go and see her.
  What about Maria McCaughn at 10.30?
  Look, I'll probably be back by then, and if not, Freya can see her.
OK. Hello, Mrs Taylor...
Maria's dates have come through from the hospital for a gastric bypass.
It's ages since we put in the request, so I wanted to come in
so we could go through the procedure. Can you manage that?
Ugh! That's a hike.
OK, so we'll use the yellow Post its for media and the green Post its for English.
  And what about the pink ones?
  Ah. We'll see.
What we need to do is break your revision down into tiny, achievable segments.
So if we start with English, what area do you need to revise for first?
Probably Shakespeare. I can't get my head around Hamlet at all.
So how would you break that down?
I've got the past papers from the last three years.
OK, so we'll do a Post it for each past paper.
And then there's Donne and Webster.
OK, so a Post it for each poem, and a Post it for each play.
But just so I can see how it works, let's do some media.
What did you study for in media?
The exams are on television drama
and audience and institution.
How do you do an exam on television drama?
We have to watch a clip and then write about the cinematography, the editing, the sound...
So you get to watch Glee?
  I wish.
  OK, well write that down on the yellow Post its.
You'll feel less swamped once you've realised exactly what you've got to do.
Great, OK.
And then I will start working on the reward system.
You have lost a little bit of weight, Maria.
  Really?
  Yeah.
Around four kilos, which puts your BMI just under 40.
40 is the NICE guideline for this operation, so that makes you borderline.
Does that mean I won't be able to have the operation?
  No, not when you're so close.
  Oh, OK.
Have you been trying to lose weight?
Getting into training for after the operation?
  No, I've not been thinking about it. I guess I've just been busy.
  Really?
I would have thought it would have been on your mind, it's a pretty big decision.
You recently took your PSV medical to drive buses?
Yeah. I was a bit worried, but I got through it.
I'm hoping to stay on the buses until retirement.
Especially now Tibor's been transferred to your depot.
  Who's Tibor?
  My new man.
Well, your operation's been scheduled for the 24th so...
Look, as I'm sure, Dr Carmichael would have explained to you
there are potential risks with any operation.
What sort of risks?
Well, all surgery has risks, but the mortality rate...
Mortality rate? What's that?
The mortality rate is the death rate.
I could die?
No. It's very, very unlikely.
I know you can't believe everything you read online, it did say I could haemorrhage, or get a hernia.
Well, yes, those are two possible complications, as are anastomotic
leakage or stricture. That's when there's a problem
with the surgical connection between the stomach and bowel.
And there's also what's called dumping syndrome which means you could experience a rapid heartbeat,
cold sweats, discomfort, diarrhoea.
But these are only potential complications.
Yeah, of course, and you might not experience any of these symptoms.
But surgery is a major decision,
and in this case it is very much your choice.
Maria, are you 100% sure you want to go through with this operation?
  I do want to lose weight.
  But there are other options.
Been there, done that. Bought the T shirt.
You managed to give up smoking.
The patches really helped, didn't they, Mum?
Yeah, they did. If only they had patches for food.
Well, it would be easier than surgery.
And your weight has stabilised over the last few years.
I gave up on dieting.
And now you've gone and lost some.
Why now?
  You mentioned a new boyfriend. Has he made you think differently about yourself?
  He certainly has!
  I just wish I'd met him 30 years ago.
  When did you meet him?
Five months yesterday.
January?
Which is when you came in here to request surgery.
Really?
Are you doing this for him?
This operation will have effects that will be lifelong.
I'm worried that if you are doing this for the wrong reasons,
you'll regret it later.
I think the doctors are right. I DO need to think it through more.
You always give up.
I'm going to walk.
Jack!
Whoa! Steady on. You all right?
Yeah, it's just really good to see you.
So are you going to make me a cup of coffee or what?
  How did it go with Maria?
  Fine.
She's changed her mind.
What? Why?
She'd lost a bit of weight, and when I told her
that her BMI was under 40 she started to question the decision.
I went through the standard risks and potential complications.
She felt it was too drastic.
But I went through all of that with her last time.
Well, maybe it didn't sink in.
Some people don't face up to things until the last minute.
So did she understand that these risks were only potential?
The rates are very low.
Yes, I did. But it wasn't just her reluctance to surgery.
It's the commitment afterwards, the weighing of the food, the meal supplements, the processing.
If she's questioning things now, what are the chances she'd stick to post op programme?
But she was so decided before. She's been trying to lose weight unsuccessfully for ages.
  What was her weight loss today?
  Four kilos.
That could just be variance, and with her, the tip of the iceberg.
What made her change her mind?
  I sensed it was more of a case of her not being committed in the first place.
  You sensed?
She mentioned a new boyfriend that she got at the same time she requested the surgery.
So perhaps she felt insecure that the relationship wasn't going to go anywhere.
Now that it has, she doesn't feel that pressure any more.
Have you phoned the hospital?
No, I wanted to talk to you about what the protocol was...
OK, so don't. If she's flip flopping around, she could easily flip back at any time.
I don't want to put on any more pressure, but OK, let's wait and see what happens over the next few days.
Well, she seemed relieved to me, as though a weight had been lifted.
I don't understand why Dad has to take it so personally.
It's a pride thing. You made him look like an idiot.
But I wasn't in control.
If I was a drug addict or an alcoholic, he'd understand.
  It's not the same Immie.
  It is!
It's compulsive, like gambling.
I didn't want half that stuff I stole, some of it was complete rubbish.
Paperclips and pens, just cheap kicks.
Once you get away with it you can't stop.
But you got caught, Im.
By Brian of all people.
Brian covered for me, and let me believe I could blag my way out of anything.
What about Ryan? He tried to stop you, didn't he?
No, he just washed his hands of me.
So it's everyone else's fault?
No, but...
OK, take stealing that coat for Cherry. It was worth hundreds!
Why didn't anyone see that?
Because no one could believe it of me.
It made me feel like I was untouchable.
  Sounds like you really got off on it.
  Yeah, I did,
and in the end I didn't care if I got busted, because getting caught was part of the thrill.
Maybe I just wanted to cause a bit of trouble, get some attention.
Couldn't you just leave that to me?
Those security tags in your room   why did you keep them?
Just mementos, I guess.
You weren't leaving a trail?
Yeah, maybe.
Do you want another coffee?
Nah, I've got a deadline.
  The stupid young doctor confused her, made her think she's doing it for you.
  For me?
Because of a coincidence, because Mum met you around the time she went in
and asked for the operation, but she'd been planning it for months.
What are you doing?
  Phoning your mum and telling her I love her exactly how she is.
  No!
  She has to have the operation.
  Not if she doesn't want to.
But she'll die of a heart attack like Nan.
No, she won't, love.
You didn't know Nan. She wasn't even as fat as Mum is now.
And she died at 60. Mum's not far off that.
Maria's just had her fitness test.
Lucy, I really don't think you should worry.
The NHS won't offer it again.
You have to convince her to have the operation while there's still time.
It's your mum's decision.
But I tell you what I will do.
I'll buy her some golf lessons for her birthday,
encourage her to get out and exercise more.
  Golf!
  Yeah, so we can start walking.
And walking is the best exercise. She'll be fitter in no time.
Golf!
Your feedback is important, so don't just eat   taste!
I need to know all the faults
so I can make improvements before the fete on Saturday.
Now, who would like the first piece?
Me!
Just a small bit for me. I don't know where you put it, Cherry.
My dad used to says I've got hollow legs.
I used to have a rule that I was only allowed birthday cake on a birthday. Or special occasions.
Have you ever considered applying the same rule to biscuits?
Just a tiny bit for me, I don't want to have to go to the gym again tonight.
Women are so obsessed with their weight,
but fitness is a much better indicator of health.
Most rugby players have BMIs that are off the scale.
I'd much rather walk than count calories.
Or inches.
  I try to play five a side to stop everything turning to flab.
  Really?
Have you read the research going on lately about the role of genes and disease in weight gain?
In ten years time, they really might have that magic little pill.
Oh, well, but until then we'll just have to stick to the old "energy in, energy out" equation.
Or we could be more accepting of a variety of body sizes.
We're constantly chasing perfection, and the medical industry's partly to blame.
By that you mean what?
Well, I think doctors who practise plastic surgery should be struck off.
So you mean Daniel?
Botox isn't really medicine, is it?
Well, it's making people feel better about themselves. That's medicine, isn't it?
Plastic surgery should be restricted to victims of trauma
and people with extreme disfigurements,
not used for rich people's vanity or social prejudice.
Hi.
I want you to have a look at this chart of Maria's weight.
Does this strike you as someone who is in control of her situation?
Every single one of these dips is succeeded by overall gain.
  But she stabilises.
  But at an unmanageable weight.
Food can be addictive, just like alcohol or drugs.
  She gave up smoking.
  Maria had made a definite decision
about a lifelong problem, and it seems to me that you have naively discouraged her.
Did you make her feel uncomfortable about some correlation
  between gastric surgery and cosmetic surgery?
  I know this is not cosmetic surgery.
Or was this born of some feminist notion about body acceptance?
No, I can understand this is a health issue.
So this is your best medical assessment?
I had an instinct that her boyfriend was pushing her into it.
And what evidence do you have?
She seemed cautious, reluctant...
Seemed! Seemed!
Well. I don't trust your judgement.
So we're going to have to call them back in for another consultation.
  Just...
  Now.
OK, 4.30 is fine.
See you later, then.
  They want me to come in again.
  Why?
  To discuss the operation.
  Well, that's fantastic.
You know Tibor rang, said he'd bought me some golf lessons for my birthday.
I've been thinking, I'm done with dieting, but maybe concentrating on getting fitter
is something I could do, especially now I've got Tibor to motivate me.
But Mum, the doctors have rung you back for good reason.
They obviously think you need the operation.
We just have to go and talk to them.
Will you do that? For me?
Thanks for coming in.
I'm concerned that my trainee GP may have overstated the risks of surgery.
I knew there might be complications, but I didn't think it might kill me!
That is highly unlikely.
It's a bit like entering the lottery.
If you enter, the chances your number will come up are there,
but as we all know, buying a ticket only slightly increases your chances of winning.
Well, my number's never come up.
I guess it's only a small chance.
Tiny. And this surgery is going to greatly increase your chances of living a longer life.
There is a massive reduction in mortality, up to 90%.
So in the long run, the odds are really on your side.
See? I think Mum nearly had a heart attack just listening to all those complications.
My colleague was also concerned that
perhaps your new boyfriend had been pressuring you into having this surgery.
Well, he does want me to get fitter, so we can play golf together.
So was he involved in your decision to have the operation at all?
No. I think the timing was just a coincidence.
I'm sorry, love. We just got our wires crossed.
Your system is brilliant. I'm powering through the tasks.
  You should see all the pink!
  It worked for me, I'm glad it helped.
It has. And Jack came to see me too, which made me feel better.
'That's really good, Immie.'
Look, you really should take Jimmi away on the weekend for his birthday!
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Everything's going to work out, I can feel it.
Although Dr Wilson might have overstated the risks of surgery, she was also concerned that
you may find it difficult to stick to a dietary program afterwards.
I've been reading up on all the meal requirements, the small portions and cooking methods...
That's great.
But it is a big lifestyle change. You're going to need to be
really committed to make this operation a success.
I mean, for a start, you'll have to take some time off work.
  How long?
  A couple of months.
I can give you a certificate. You didn't seem to mind before.
It didn't seem to hit. But if it's part of the big picture...
You're going to be on a very restrictive eating program.
You're going to have to process all food at first in order to aid digestion.
Even in the long run it's imperative that you get your
proteins and nutrients in first, and your stomach is going to be so small there's no room for treats.
  Not even chocolate?
  Not for a long time.
Maybe years.
Where's the fun in that?
That's the point.
Eating is not going to be fun.
Eating is going to be primarily a necessity.
  Maybe you do need some more time to think about this after all.
  No!
This was all your fault.
Sure, this is difficult, but what are you offering her instead?
Another yo yo diet and some crappy motivational speeches
that will end in another ten kilos and an early death?
This was her last chance to overcome this, and you guys are doing your best to talk her out of it!
It's a joke!
Excuse me.
Well, your instinct WAS right. Ish.
I'm sorry, Lucy. I don't think I can do it.
I should have known you'd back out.
  I'm happy as I am.
  You're an embarrassment!
Don't you care how people look at you, what they think?
What they say behind your back?
Laughing at your rolls of fat and your waddle of a walk?
I don't care what people think.
What about what I think?
You're disgusting, and I'm ashamed of you!
Are you OK?
Are you ashamed about your weight?
Look, your mum, she's pretty healthy, all things considered,
and she seems happy.
  Is she happy?
  Yeah, she is.
And are YOU happy?
No.
Do you want to lose weight?
Of course I do,
but I'll try and try and end up like her.
Wait. No, Maria doesn't have to change in order for you to change.
I know that you and your mum have got a long history of dieting,
but there are other options.
Like what?
  Well, counselling for a start.
  Counselling?
Look, I'm a doctor, not a psychologist, but I suspect that you
working through your relationship with your mum is going to be just as helpful as counting calories.
Sometimes I resist something she's been eating for hours, and then I crack.
Having crap food around all the time just wears me down.
I hear you. It's like the biscuit tin in the staff room.
It gives me the evil eye every lunch time!
I've been thinking of moving out.
A mate's got a room going.
Well, that could be helpful.
And we could see what other help's available, you know, maybe make some calls?
You'll love it. It's about shoplifting, how it
becomes as compulsive as gambling. It's an insider's view.
It's based on my sister, but I've kept it anonymous.
Its really great stuff, you'll really like it. Ready in about an hour.
Great, thanks.
I'm really sorry, Mum.
I'm not ashamed of you.
I love you,
but I want my life to be different.
Here...
It's your favourite.
But I don't want any, OK?
I'm a bad influence.
Only in one thing, Mum.
In everything else, you're fantastic.
I'll take it to work, eat it for morning tea. When you're not around.
  Thanks.
  Maria?
  Are you ready?
  Certainly am.
Hi, love.
You know,
I think it's time I moved out.
You guys need your space.
Moved out? Why?
Helen's got a room going. It comes up next month. It'd be fun.
Thanks, Mum.
So when do I get to move in, then?
  'Hello?'
  Dad?
Dad, I'm so, so sorry.
I know I've made you look bad, but I really never meant to.
I should have owned up much earlier. But I love you, Dad.
Karen.
Dad?
It's for you.
  Hello?
  Mum? Dad still won't talk to me.
Oh...hold on.
Won't you talk to her?
Not yet, love, he's still angry.
When's he going to forgive to me?
I don't know, love, I don't know.
  Just do something, instead of watching the TV all day.
  I'm sorry.
Stop saying you're sorry!
I would like to request one of your taxis, please.
The name, Gladys Smith.
Your wife said...
  What did she say?
  She's just concerned.
So, what you think I'm nuts?
Oh, I confess!
