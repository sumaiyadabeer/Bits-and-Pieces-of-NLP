yourself warm and we will see you Good afternoon. Within the last
hour, police have confirmed that the landscape architect, Joanna
Yeates, was strangled. The body of the 25 year old was found on
Christmas Day. She'd been missing for eight days. Ben Geoghegan
reports. Joanna Yeates disappeared 11 days ago. Her frozen body was
found on a roadside on Christmas day. This afternoon following a
postmortem examination the police confirmed she had been murdered.
The pathologist completed his examination last night and
concluded that the cause of her death was compression of the neck.
In other words strangulation. Police believe her body had been at
the spot where she was found for several days. Officers were still
at the scene today looking for clues as to why she was killed hand
was responsible. Yesterday, Joanna's parents visited the site.
It was they who formally identified her body. Somebody out there does
know what happened to Joanna. Somebody out there is holding that
vital piece of information we need to help provide Joanna's family
with the answers they need and want. Ms Yeates lived with her boyfriend,
who reported her missing two days after she was seen alive. He is
being treated as a witness, not a suspect.
Robert Hall is in Bristol. Robert, what are some of the leads now that
the police there will have to follow up? Jane, we heard in the
press conference there are numerous lines of inquiry. They could be
grouped into three areas. First of all Joanna Yeates, her lifestyle.
Police would like to talk to her friends, other tenants in the flats.
Secondly, what happened on the night she disappeared? She went to
the pub, apparently got back to her flat at a quarter to nine. Was
there somebody on the street who saw suspicious activity? And
thirdly the route from the flat to the place where she was found. One
route takes you across the Clifton suspension bridge, with its closed 
circuit television cameras. There were a lot of motorists about.
Police are desperately keen to here from anybody who may have seen
anything. A man has died after armed police
stormed a house in Kirkheaton near Huddersfield to end a siege that
had lasted all night. Police say a 42 year old man had been shooting
at them from inside the property, and one officer had been wounded.
Fiona Trott is there. This incident may have ended eight
hours ago, but it has still brought this part of rural Kirkheaton to a
standstill this afternoon. Look how close it it was other people's
homes. They were telling us they were terrified by what was
happening last night. They've named the dead man as Alastair Bell. They
say they believe he was known to the police. Come to your door and
speak to the officers. You will not be harmed. These words made no
difference at all. This man hiding in the darkness locked the police
in an eight hour stand off. In this busy residential area no chances
were taken. All the emergency services were on standby, but just
after 5.30 this morning it came to an end. The 42 year old was shot.
Despite being treated by paramedics, he was pronounced dead. This
afternoon, the police have taken over much of the village. This
woman's house is still cord oned off. Just down there at the side of
our garden, down the back of the house and down the other side. I
was woken up at ten o'clock by a couple of taps on the window. I
don't know who that was or what it was. Then we heard five what I
understand now to be gun shots ring out. We thought they were fireworks
but they were definitely gun shots. My partner came out to see what was
going on. The next thing we know five armed police were lying in the
back garden. Another villager said he knew the dead man, named locally
as Alastair Bell. Something like this is going to shock everyone
really. He were well known. This investigation has been taken over
by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Its main aim,
to determine if the police acted correctly.
There are investigators here from all over the country this afternoon.
The officer who was shot is now recovering at home. He was lucky to
receive minor injuries. People here say when you look at the location,
they say it is lucky that this end to do so way it did. That it didn't
end any worse. The Government has been defending
its handling of the winter flu outbreak and denied that children
under five were excluded from this year's vaccination programme.
Labour had accused the Government of cost cutting and leaving young
children at risk following a sharp rise in the number of people
admitted to hospital with flu. The Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley,
says his decisions were based on independent medical advice. There
was never a vaccination campaign for seasonal flu for under fives.
Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Therefore there was
no campaign to cancel, so that's completely wrong.
A man and a woman have been remanded in custody after appearing
in court charged with the murder of a teenage boy. The 15 year old, who
hasn't been named, was found in a bath at a house in Newham, East
London, on Christmas Day. Eric Baikubi and Magalie Bamu, who are
both 27, have been jointly charged with murder. England are on the
verge of retaining the Ashes at the end of the third day of the Fourth
Test. Australia were 169 6. They need another 246 runs to make
Melbourne here's James Pearce. Outside the MCG there are statues
in honour of some of Australia's greatest players. If the current
generation was to hold on to the ashs the performance to match some
of these men's very best was required. First the Australian
bowlers had to bring an end to England's innings. A boundary from
Graeme Swann took the tourists past the 400 mark. By the time Peter Sid
el had polished off Anderson England were almost out of sight.
A foolish single ended with Philip Hughes out of his crease, and
England gifted its first wicket. Tim Bresnan is playing his first
match of the series, but his role has been decisive. Watson trapped
LBW. Then the key swaup of Ricky Ponting. His tenure as Australian
Captain should well be coming to an end. The home side had lost six
players are already conceding defeat and talking about their next
