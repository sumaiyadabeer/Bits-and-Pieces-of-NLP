Coming up: Land of the Giants. We speak to Nathan Brown.
Action from around 18 of the Super League. And we catch up with Steve
Prescott and his latest charity This club was established in 1864.
Now it is one of the giants among the Super League. The Challenge Cup
finalist twice in recent years, and now asserting themselves in Super
A very warm welcome to the Galpharm Stadium. Delighted to be here
alongside the Warrington Wolves. I have to ask you about your injury?
I jarred my back last Friday. I just didn't respond to treatment as
I would have liked throughout the week. I tried to train on Thursday
but it was not to be. Hopefully a week's rest and I will be ready for
next week. I know you would want to play in that one next week, one of
the games of the season. It is a massive game. Weeds becoming into
some great form.    Leeds. We need to consolidate our position in
second. It will be a great game to play in. An important game as well.
We will reflect later on the events on the pitch last night. When you
get 40 points and not play well, that must be a good omen? It is a
testament to how far the group has come. We won with 40 points. I am
disappointed with the manner in which we played, especially the
first half. We managed to get the wind.    win. There is plenty to
work on this week. We managed to get a win and we are happy with
extremely exciting game so far. The first 30 minutes of the first half
was all about Hull, but Huddersfield have come back into
their own. It is 6 18. I think they are just about to score... It is
very exciting here on the sideline. I will be chatting later on with
their head coach and also one of the injured players. It is all
going on! A very useful response, they are back in the game and we
will keep you up to date. Now, some action. Last night Bradford
entertained Richie and Warrington. Warrington are in top form.
Tony Smith can count on Gareth for a inclusion again. We have Mori,
Bridge and Westwood today. The Bradford Bulls have increasing
injury problems. Warrington on the charge early.
Hall and got won with a big tackle on him. Now Monahan of wanting to
get things moving from dummy half. WHISTLE BLOWS. Richard Silverwood
goes to the square. Checking for a possible obstruction. Was Steve
Menzies, hindered by Atkins? And the video referee says no.
Warrington on the board. It is wryly's 17th try of the season.   
Riley's. Bradford looking for a big response.
Carney closing in... Has he been Carney closing in... Has he been
able to get the ball down in time? He does not think so. Frustration
for Kearney. He is right. No try for    the Bulls.
Are a demoralising defeat for the Bradford Bulls just weeks ago.
Plenty of options, King is out wide... He squeezes in at the
corner, four tries in four games. Blistering form. Harrison's offload
was superb, really laid the platform for what was to follow.
The Bradford Bulls defence had no well here. Bradford on the ball for
the first time. Paul Sykes was wrestled to the ground. The ball
spilled loose and L'Estrange, from close range. Adrian Morley stands
his ground. WHISTLE BLOWS. Bradford New road, bridge in the tackle.
Whitehead stretching forward, he has got the ball away and the
Bradford Bulls score. Full marks to Eliot Whitehead for having the
audacity to get the ball clear. It win in a row over the Bradford
Bulls for the first time since the 50s. Briers continues his fine form.
Yet more tries in this topsy turvey game. David Solomon driving forward
through an excellent offload. Warrington are running amok,
driving forward through Solomona. Last strange, I got when N Hall
He has! How many times have we seen him do that? His third try of the
season. Just spotted the gap, and fired in. Warrington's lead is
eight points. Puts the kick through and it has bounced awkwardly for a
   Riley. Menzies takes what is on offer. A perfect start to the
second half. What a game this is turning out to be. Now Solomona.
The ball has been spilled. Looked along the line towards Halle. A
very good ball. Another try! Halle has scored it. Steve McNamara wants
to work the troops. A good break from Paul Sykes. Now, the chance to
draw level. Westwood, played well last week against France. As
Warrington look to put pressure on here. Reilly has scored a try out
of nothing. The Bradford Bulls just did not see him coming. Lee Briers
kicked through, hopeful and nothing more, but the bounce when the right
has plenty of support. It will be another try for Warrington. A
second in as many minutes. This time, Atkins. Two tries in two
minutes for Warrington. The Bradford Bulls are looking to hit
back. Steve Crossley trying to turn away. Here is Heath L'Estrange.
WHISTLE BLOWS. A try for Carney. Monaghan. Attlee is in with the
tackle. Briers waits on. Higham is at dummy half. Goes himself. That
could be a game at clinching try... He thinks he has scored. Clever
break again. Bradford's tired defence could not match him and
Warrington are on their way to a very important to point.    two
points. They have been far from their best. Sykes tries something
different. On it goes! Bradford rampaging here. Steve McNamara
looks on. Out it goes, the ball is lost. Was it stripped or spilled?
Halle thinks it was stripped away. Shows his frustrations. It has not
been the day for Bradford. Warrington have been far from their
best. They come up with the points best. They come up with the points
which keeps them in the top spot. We did say you didn't play at your
best but the fact that you can score so many tries means that
there is real confidence in the team. We made it very hard work for
ourselves. There were errors and we let Bradford into our half.
Sometimes you pay for those mistakes. We have got class and
confidence throughout the squad, especially now attack. A couple of
players scored for us. There were a couple of great passes. We can
attack well and get the points. You cannot maintain that same
intensity week after week. There has got to be an occasion where you
are not on top form. I don't know. I think if you listen to our coach,
and what is expected of us, we have to be our best every week. The
Super League this year has demanded the best every week. Sometimes you
do not get a perfect performance but you have to be somewhere near.
Let's have a look at Bradford. They desperately needed a victory. It is
just not going right for them at the moment. They seem to be trying
very hard. They have had a lot of injuries. It is quite important
that they stick together. There are a class side and working hard for
one another. When they miss an intercept or that kind of thing,
you take advantage. Definitely. Sometimes it all seems to go
against you. We capitalised on a couple of their mistakes and
managed to get the points. Next week is a big one?
Yes, a massive game against Leeds. They have been great form. It is
going to be a big game and very important for where we finish in
the table. You have made it clear that you will not be playing for
Warrington next season. Why is First and foremost, it is a
decision I have not made lightly. I have had a lot of thinking to do
about it. I feel at this stage of my career, it is time. I am at my
peak and I want to play every week. As I understand it, I will have to
fight if I had stayed for a place in the squad. I weighed it up and
decided it is probably best to choose my dream. I have still got a
lot of ambitions to fulfill. It is a great place to play and a
fantastic bunch of lads. A very tough decision to make.
It is probably fair to say not much will happen over the next few weeks.
This kind of situation developed towards the end of the season?
is something that I have had in the back of my mind and I thought
things may take care of themselves. I have to stay fit and play well.
Look after myself. Thanks very much for that. Let's go
back to Robbie. A remarkable game. The game has been turned on its
head. The first half was all about Hull FC. This half is about Bristol.
Their momentum is going in the way of Hull FC. As you can see behind
me, they are very pleased with how things are going. How would you
rate 2010? It has been a bit up and down. Obviously, to get knocked out
of the Cup early was disappointing after such a good run last year. It
is an important competition. The fashion we went out wasn't great.
But today, sides do get big scores. Perhaps the most disappointing
thing for me was losing the close games. Last year, we will now close
games.    we won our. In the past four weeks we have lost
to three of the top teams. We lost in key moments. We were not playing
quite well enough. After announcing your decision to
leave the club, has it had an effect on the squad? No, I think we
have played some good footy. Our effort hasn't been too bad. I would
like to think that it has not. Perhaps it had some small effect at
first. Brett Hodgson had a big effect early on. Maybe losing him
wasn't very good for the team but perhaps it was to be expected. I
like to think it has not had too much effect. Can you take this team
to Old Trafford and would there be a perfect end still time?    end to
your time? At the start, I said to the
chairman we have a squad capable of going better this year. It is clear
when he is out there what kind of team we are. Of course for a day he
has only played a few games but it is true that we have a lot of
enthusiasm and we did well. Ross has looked better. It is going to
be harder this year to win something because other sides have
improved as well. Wigan have the consistency and they are the team
to beat. And St Helens as well. Warrington is better. This year it
has been about having the right people on the field at the right
time. Winning enough games in between. With the right personnel,
we are in a better position to win something this year but you need
the luck as well. You're still fairly young. Can you
see yourself back in Super League? I spoke about it with my wife and I
would like to come back at some stage. Definitely when the children
are a little bit older as well. It is a competition I have enjoyed. It
is a great experience for me. To see all these fans from the other
clubs seeing their team's song. In Australia, we don't get that. When
you're a team is not there, you don't go. When your teams are
getting beaten, there is no singing. But it is different here. There is
a good vibe. There is a lot of support. We have had a great
experience. I would like to say I I have one of those players than
Nathan mentioned with me right now, one of the injured stars of the
Huddersfield Giants. David, what is it gonna be like losing a coach
like him? It is going to be a huge loss. He was probably the biggest
influence on my signing. I came here to play here because of him. I
was disappointed when I found out but it is one of those things.
Players and coaches come and go. You have to move on and see who's
gonna come next year. I am looking forward to seeing who the new coach
is. I'm looking forward to working with them.
How have you found the club? It has been great. The town is quite small,
smaller than when I come from. Sydney is bigger than this. I have
got used to the low atmosphere. It is quite relaxing. And the nice
weather is coming out. It is time to enjoy it.
How are the boys going? It is one of those games where we could do
little things better. But at the same time, there is a huge effort.
In the second half, they came from 18 0 down. Hopefully, they will
come away with a win. We need to get the win to get back on track.
Looking forward to coming back in about five weeks. Hopefully, I will
finish off the season. Enjoy the rest of the season.
An interesting situation developing. The Giants could take the lead if
they get this kick. They are in the lead. What a fight back. Some
decent games going on elsewhere. Salford 22 22 Castleford. Hull
Kingston Rovers are leading Harlequins by 36 6. Leeds over
Crusaders 20 18. When you lose somebody like Nathan it is a big
hole in this set up. Yes, it will be hard to cover him. My I think
with the coach of Nathan's calibre, it has put the club in good shape
for the future. It is a sign of a great coach to put in the
infrastructure in place and hopefully, when he hands over it
will be a smooth transition. They have come on leaps and bounds and
the last few years. And they lead this game. A remarkable fightback.
Whoever takes the reins at Huddersfield, they are going to
come to a club with a big heritage. Huddersfield is the home of rugby
league. Nd Giddens is there to meet the rugby league historian Tony
This is fantastic. You look at the trophies and the shirts and the
posters and the photographs of the legendary players. Give us the
history lesson. Why are we here? This is where it started. On 29th
August 1895, the leading clubs came together in the North of England
and decided they wanted their own game and forms a union which became
rapidly. There are a few myths. Was there ever a chance of
reconciliation between the unions? There were people who thought there
would be a reconciliation. But the Rugby Union was determined not to
compromise. Within a few weeks after the clubs met, the Rugby
Union banned for ever anyone who played in the League and they also
banned them from playing rugby union and anyone who had contact
with them. And it has not always been 13 aside.
It didn't start off that way. for first 11 years, it was played
according to rugby union rules. Other than the fact they allowed
players to be paid. Only in 1906 to come down to 13 in a side. And then
we had the rule about moving away from the rucks and the mauls. These
rules were around in the days of rugby union and they thought they
were developing rugby into its most modern and scientific form. That's
what happened. That was a small start of the beginnings of rugby
league. In a social context, how important did it become to the
North? It came to be a symbol of the North of England. It symbolised
a strong sense of community, fairness and it also represented a
sense that maybe the North was not getting a fair share. Maybe there
was some bias in the media. I think you can see that there is a great
phrase that is often used, you still hear it, it is the best in
the Northern Union. If you are the best player in the Northern Union,
you are the best player wherever. It also symbolised something much
more. It also meant that if you are from the North, it was going to be
the best. What it is the relevance of the
heritage museum? It is one of the most important historic sites in
British sport. Every rugby league supporter knows it was formed in
the George Hotel but can they sell where the Football Association was
formed all the rugby union association? That is because the
George symbolises something very important and powerful. It
symbolises how people came together to decide they want to the sport
that was the way they wanted it. It was a sport where anybody can play
it regardless of their background. It is incredibly important because
that is the message are rapidly. It is a game for everybody. We had the
England international the other day. It is a special year with the
anniversary of the first tour Down Under. Yes, it is the centenary of
the first tour of the British Lions to Australia. And New Zealand. It
is a fantastic occasion. The sport was born in the North of England
and to some extent it was restricted to north of England.
Here they were in 1910, when people did not travel abroad for holidays,
they were going 14,000 miles to play rugby against people they had
never seen before. They had never had any communication with them. It
is fantastically important and it is important for the game in the
North of England. It symbolises that rugby league can expand, that
it is an international game. It does have that future ahead of it.
We're here in Huddersfield. We are looking forward to the match. How
important are Huddersfield in the great scheme? Without Huddersfield,
rugby league would have been very different. It was the first true
grat super club before the First World War. That team was known as
the 'team of all the talents'. They brought people from Australia
and New Zealand. They established what we know as rugby league in
terms of bringing players from all over world to represent your town.
So you look back at the names of Wagstaff, Rosenfield, these are
names that are still known today. It really established what a rugby
league club could be. Huddersfield is always going to be one of the
most important clubs in the game and hopefully that is what they are
Here we have 150 years of rugby league history. 1001 stories about
the sport's pioneers, the great and the good, at the home of rugby
I urge any rugby league fan to go and see that. It is a fantastic
place. This place as well as one of the friendliest of rugby league
places you can imagine. At the moment it is turning out to be a
problem for Hull FC. We just saw a fantastic try. Hull FC have got big
problems. We also got a shock. At Headingley, Crusaders lead Leeds
26 20. We will put more flesh on to that in just a moment or so. One
man who is important to the Heritage Centre is old Crabtree.   
Earl. His grandfather's medal was there.
As we count down, you are not able to play against Hull FC. How long
will you be out for? It is one of those unfortunate things. I got
caught in a tackle. It hurt pretty bad. I tried to run it off, but I
have a torn ligament in my leg, but I will be back in a couple of weeks.
I will hopefully be ready for the end of the season.
Sum up, in your words, the season as a whole. I think so far, it has
been pretty disappointing. I think the fans would agree. I think we
are all a little bit disappointed, and how close we have been getting.
We have not been able to put it to bed. We know it is there it is just
not coming together. If we can click the final part of the season,
it could end up a really good season.
Do you like the kind of senior man role? Are you good for guidance and
advice to younger players? I am a calming figure. I would not be a
great captain. I'm not inspirational or anything like that.
I have a relaxed attitude. So if you want to calm your nerves, I am
probably your man. But if you what motivation, you might want to see
someone else. Do you get an extra sense of pride,
because Huddersfield is as important as it is? Definitely. For
me, it is massive. I am proud to know that these younger lads are
coming through the ranks. That is a big thing for me. I want to be
around Huddersfield. I have been a junior, coming through to Senior
level, and going through further than that to coaching level. It is
good to see these boys doing well for themselves.
When did you become aware that Rugby League was important in your
family? My grandmother passed down to some medals to me quite some
years ago. They were my grandad's. I do not think my dad was too happy
about it, I think he wanted them for himself. He knew I was into my
rugby anyway. I have got his winner's medal from 1931 at Wembley.
I have donated it to the Heritage Centre in Huddersfield. I can come
and look at them any time. He did not play that day but he has got a
winner's medal. So when you come to the heritage museum you see the
photos and stories from the newspapers, along with the other
bits of memorabilia. What goes through your mind? I feel a little
bit envious, to be honest. It is something I have set my head to, I
want to play in front of thousands of people, but I always want to win
something. It hasn't really come around yet. I am still waiting for
the day to win something prestigious. It is hard work. But
we are getting closer and we are getting better every year. I'm sure
it is just round the corner. If I just won one medal, I will be happy.
I suppose it is just a story he is not in the England squad? I think
so. On the back of his form as an impact forward, I think he really
caused the Australians and Kiwis some damage. He is a fantastic
player. That should be a definite goal for the end of the year. Is
there a feeling that there is a quality in the England squad to
actually go and upset the Aussies and New Zealanders? I think,
without a doubt. If you look at the squad Stephen McNamara just named,
it is overflowing with experienced and titled players. It is a great
chance to go on tour at the end of the year and put our best foot
forward. There is some exciting talent and we have players to pick
from in every position. It all bodes well for the future.
Our next game from last night, in Perpignan.
Wakefield are in freefall, one win in it. Wildcats coach could be the
next Dragons was it you believe what you read. Dragons looking to
press through here. Blanch has got the legs to do it. What a great
start from the Wakefield Wildcats. He races the full length of the
field. A super start for the visitors. Blanch, seldom caught.
His 8th try in nine games. He is in fine form. Can they back that up in
fine form. Can they back that up in the rest of the game?
Show what, and neat and tidy little run. Here he is in dummy half. It
out wide it goes. What a try! What a response from the Catalan
Yes, there's been a great turn out this afternoon. It is a very good
rugby league ground. Especially in the semi finals of the Challenge
Cup. A fantastic atmosphere. with this performance from
Huddersfield, is that what they need? Maybe, they have been a bit
down of late. A good win, and especially a comeback like this, it
is good for the team for the rest of the season. Here is a look at
some the games that have just ended. Quite a few close ones. Salford
against Castleford. A game of two halves. Castleford
just about avoided throwing away a 16 point half time lead. They
dominated the first half. There was a hat trick from Dean Withers.
Salford just offering one try. In the second half, Salford were
rejuvenated. They destroyed Castleford and ran in some good
tries. The try of the match was from Daniel Holdsworth. It was all
level and the game was on a knife  edge but Castleford recovered their
poise and Forster try six minutes from the end.    forced a try.
They fought their way back into red. Maybe Castleford deserved the two
points. The standby for what may be the shock of the season. Mark
Wilson has been at Headingley. The final score is 26 32. An
absolute classic game this afternoon. The lead changed hands
several times. When the rhinos went into the lead after three minutes,
you sensed that the floodgates would be open. But a penalty
narrowed that the gap at half time. The Crusaders came out firing after
the interval and it led to some points the board. The Crusaders
were not done and a penalty goal levelled things up with a 50m goal.
Delaney scored after a great move for with seven minutes to go, the
two teams were level. You felt that a drop goal was going to come. But
it was not to be. Vince manners crashed in into the corner. This
was Super League at its best. A That is a real turn up for the
books. But it is no surprise. We just have time to catch up with the
inspirational work that Steve got us doing. This is where 60 % of the
money raised by my foundation goes. The thing that really impresses me
is that he is a normal chap. He turns up and you don't know who he
is. When we give him the treatment, whatever side effects we may cause,
he still battles on. I was shown at the some real kind is when I was
first diagnosed. I got a lot of help. A lot of people from the
me a lot of kindness and I wanted to give something back. To help
other people is what I want to do. We got a grant and to get it we
could only get a third of the money so the other money is coming from
the money Steve has raised. All carried out the study, actually. It
is very important to help other patients. It is amazing what
Stephen and his supporters have done over last three years. What
they have done like walking along the Pennines and cycling through
France. They have done a brilliant job and raised over £75,000 for the
charity. It is brilliant. We are planning for next year now. We have
a parachute jump planned for the Grand Final. We are engaging the
sponsors. We are planning another boxing event at the end of the year.
We have been given a place the third. Hopefully it is going to be
in Leeds or St Helens. There are people approaching us as
well who are putting their own events on. They are much needed and
welcome. Today, we want to tell all the people who are part of the
Steve Prescott Foundation what we are doing. When they go out and
they get up early to cycle or run, they know what the money is going
to be used for. It means that hopefully in the
future they will be inspired to get up because they are raising money
to help patients. Steve is doing a fantastic job and we will keep you
up to date with the other thing he is doing. Mark your card for next
week. You can watch all the shows
throughout the week on the BBC iPlayer. It is worth checking all
the listings because with the World Cup entering the knockout stages,
Kingston Rovers beat Harlequins convincingly. And there is a belter
of a game about to start. We have Wigan playing. I think Wigan are
