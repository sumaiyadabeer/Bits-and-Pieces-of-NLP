La, la, la La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la La, la, la, la
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about
La, la, la...
What the...?
It's nothing to be worried about.
Mrs Richards, this practice has a highly regarded reputation for excellent patient care.
We have been a part of the Letherbridge community...
..for many years.
I can assure you, Mr Williams, that there is no danger of...
So rude!
That is the eighth this morning.
I knew it. Those letters have made things worse.
You were right.
Mrs Tembe, could you try and think before you speak?
What do you mean?
The word danger is not a good choice when people are so jittery.
  I was trying to make matters clear.
  I understand.
Perhaps you would prefer me to do something else, Mrs Parsons?
No, no. No, you're doing fine.
  Just, um, be a bit more positive.
Good morning, the Mill Health Centre.
I can assure you that the Mill Health Centre
is the safest place in the whole of Letherbridge.
Yes.
It's him! I knew he was behind this!
"Emergency. Which service?"
Police. I've got thieves on my property.
Sorry I'm late. It's all right. I've already seen it.
  You have?
  It was a bit of a shock.
Yeah, I can imagine.
St John's Wort. I swear by it. That and a bit of meditation.
I'm glad you're coping.
It's big news for now. Eventually, it'll calm down.
Eventually, it'll change. Just get on with...
Elaine.
I'd have given them a better picture, if they'd asked.
Ouch.
Right, start slinging this lot in the back of the van.
And watch out for rats.
What the...?
Mr Jones, any more of that and I'll call the police!
I've already called them. They'll see you off!
  Sergeant Hollins. Are you in charge, mate?
  Yeah, I am.
Get them off my property!
  I want them gone now!
  All right, calm down. Mr Jones, is it?
I'll calm down when you've arrested these thieves.
In my day, people couldn't take things from your garden!
I have a court order allowing...
And the police didn't just stand around and let them!
Go on! Go on, arrest him!
  Arrest the lot of them.
  We have every right to be here!
  You have no rights!
  Bill Trevor. Environmental Health.
This is my home! I'll live as I like!
What's it got to do with you? With any of you?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Put that down!
Mr Jones, this is a court order.
You have to let Mr Trevor do his job.
I don't believe this! I called you, now you join him!
  I'm joining nobody.
  Are you happy now, are you? All of you?
  In my day, I knew how to do my duty!
  Stop that!
But you have no backbone today!
I hope Elaine can cope with all this.
She looked fine to me.
Heston's late.
This show of his could not have come at a worse time.
  We can't blame him, he couldn't have known what would happen.
  I'm not blaming him.
But he knows how difficult things are.
I could have done with support.
  Well, we can hold the fort, can't we, Jimmi?
  Yeah, sure.
Mr Reynolds.
Would you like to follow me?
See? One down. Only a couple of hundred more to go.
Quisling! Turning on one of your own!
Get them to stand back or go home. They're making things worse.
  How long has this been going on?
  Don't ask.
But it ends today.
We're safe in here, love.
They can't touch us now.
I have had over 20 requests
for patient notes to be sent to other surgeries.
Really? Should we be doing this, then? It doesn't seem to be helping.
I agree. But we have had our orders.
Ah, good morning, Dr Carter.
Ah!
Dr Carter, what is it?
Hot drink. I need a hot drink.
Oh, my goodness! Dr Carter, come and sit down.
Imogen, pour some tea, please.
How did this happen?
No, do not answer that.
How was your dress rehearsal?
Do not answer that either.
That bad? We will not allow it to stop the show.
We will find a way.
Now, today, your voice needs complete rest.
Not a word until the start of the show.
What about his patients?
Oh!
Oh! Despicable!
What's got into her?
Oh!
Makes sense to me.
Here you go, one of Cherry's lemon teas
with a spoonful of Elaine's special organic Himalayan honey. Try that.
How's it going with your other patients?
Mrs Tembe's explaining to everyone before they come in.
Oh! She did tell me to let you know that your next patient is a Japanese lady.
She's here on holiday, but she doesn't speak much English.
Is there no other way?
We've tried every other way. This is the last resort, believe me.
What do you know about him?
  Ex navy. Lives alone. Keeps himself to himself.
  Anything else?
Just what the neighbours told me. He saw action in the Falklands. Got a couple of medals.
Also, years back, he used to do a lot of community work.
Drove a minibus for the day centre, delivered meals on wheels.
Did he? How did he get into this mess?
I don't know how it began,
but the complaints started coming in ages back.
Neighbours sick of the smell and the vermin. It is disgusting.
You've had it up to here with him, haven't you?
I've tried the sympathetic bit. All he does is throw it back at me. Sees me as his enemy.
If you ask me, he needs medical help,
but there's no chance of him listening. Stubborn old goat.
  Ah, well, shall we get on?
  Yeah.
I don't enjoy upsetting an old man, you know.
I'll, er, I'll call the locksmith.
I said the letters were the wrong tactic.
  It is not fair to blame the letters.
  What else?
The practice is all over the newspapers again this morning.
And that article won't have helped.
Dr Seductress draped all over Dr Death.
  I wouldn't go that far.
  I'd go further.
I'd say that article has done more damage than the letters.
Patients won't know whether to trust Elaine's judgement.
If she can't spot a murderer, how can she spot a disease?
You know that's how they think.
Elaine! Um...
We were discussing how many patients came in today. How about you?
Four. A couple cancelled.
  Hardly surprising.
  What, you've never had a patient cancel?
Well, of course. But not because they were afraid to come into the surgery.
Maybe I can help you with that.
Mr Leigh's ready to make a start.
I'll tell you what, just give me one more go. Just one more.
Mr Jones?
Mr Jones, open the door.
Mr Jones? Kenny?
Come on, open the door.
This is your last chance.
We don't want to damage your property, but....
Oh, come on, sir.
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey.
Can you believe it?
I fought for this country
and they can't even leave us in peace to live as we want.
How dare they?
How dare they tell us how we can live our lives?
They're nothing more than a bunch of vandals,
trying to break into a man's house.
Into his home.
Listen to me going on.
Keeping you awake.
Get some rest, my darling girl.
I put menthol in it.
Is it working?
Oh, breathe deeper!
That's it. I've tried everything.
Unless...
There is one other thing that I can think of.
It's the only thing left.
But I need your say so.
Mr Jones?
You lot make a start in here.
I'll check through the ground floor.
They won't get in.
I've made sure of that.
Kenny?
Kenny, listen to me.
You've, you've got to come out sometime.
  Take a seat.
  Thanks.
Miss York, do you want to come through?
Now I know how Kevin feels.
Look, if you want to take some time off...
Time off? Why would I want that?
Good luck.
The rest of the house is being cleared.
There's only this room left.
Get lost! Get out!
Come on, Kenny.
Go away!
Please!
Just...go...away!
A hem! My men should have clocked off by now.
Oh! You've been patient this long,
I mean, a little bit longer won't hurt, will it?
  Good man.
  Come on, lads.
Kenny?
You can't stay in there forever.
This is going to happen, whether you like it or not.
All right.
You can't do this!
Come on, Kenny.
Let me get you out of there so these lads can get on with their work.
Why don't you leave us alone?
All this upset over a pile of rubbish?
You all right, Sergeant?
  Don't come any further.
  What?
Keep your lads back.
  Do as I say, please.
  Yeah, OK. Come on, lads.
Take a break.
I'm glad this day is almost over.
So am I. Now I can go home and get ready for tonight. I'm so excited.
I hope they're be serving wine.
I do not know if I should wear my blue two piece or the dress I wore
to meet her Majesty and to watch highlights of the Royal Wedding.
That is the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth! Ehhhhhh...
Dr Carter, you can speak!
So I can!
It is a miracle. How can this be?
Alas, that must remain a secret between the healer and the healed.
I hope it was nothing illegal.
  Mrs Tembe!
  I resent that!
Ladies, ladies.
Imogen's dedication to the task has been second to none, bar yours. Thank you, Imogen.
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la...
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine...
Kenny...
Shh! You'll wake her.
You'll have to start talking to me. Tell me what happened here.
All quiet now.
Nothing to be afraid of.
Everyone's being very patient...
  Everyone?
  The medical examiner's here...
and a lot of other people who need to get in.
Now, they've agree to let me stay and talk to you, but I can only keep them away for so long.
Mabel's always had trouble sleeping so I sing to her.
You are my sunshine My only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey...
Kenny!
  It's her favourite song.
  They're going to have to take Mabel away.
No, there's no need.
I can make her better.
She just needs rest.
Don't let them take her.
I am so excited.
You would be.
Are you not excited, Dr Carmichael, at the thought of such a treat?
I can hardly contain myself(!)
  Jimmi, any sign of Elaine?
  No.
Does anybody want a drink?
Yeah.
Can you remember what this room was like before, Kenny?
  Eh?
  I bet Mabel kept the house spick and span.
I bet you could eat your dinner off the floor.
Yes.
Tell me what it was like.
Can you remember?
We had flowers.
All over the place, fresh cut flowers from the garden.
She could grow anything.
And the house always... had the smell of polish.
Lavender polish.
I... I said that she'd polish all the furniture away.
She laughed when I said that.
Polish and fresh flowers.
Sounds like my mum's.
What else?
Lace.
Mabel loved lace.
We had lace everywhere.
In the curtains,
on the backs of the chairs.
And?
And in the evening,
when the lamps...
..were lit, the place was aglow.
But nothing shone as bright as Mabel's smile.
It was like the sun.
Though...it never set.
And when she looked at me...
..there was such love.
Do you know what it's like to be loved like that?
You walk into a room and someone's face just lights up...
just at the sight of you.
That's a light that can't go out...
It just can't go out.
It just can't go.
What would Mabel say if she could see this room now?
I'd get a right earful!
What happened to her?
Happened?
Tell me. Tell me, Kenny.
She'll wake soon.
No...
No, she...she won't wake up.
And I think deep down, you know that.
Tell me how she died.
We took a picnic to the park...
..walked up into the woods afterwards.
Found the little bridge over the stream.
That evening,
she turned to me and she said, "Thank you".
I didn't know what she meant. Why was she thanking me?
She turned, and...
She said, "Thank you for being my Kenny."
And then...
Then, she went to sleep.
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take
My sunshine away.
She didn't go to sleep, look at her.
Look at her.
Oh...
  Oh...
  Come on.
Bill?
  Come on.
Come on, old man.
  Here you go.
That's right, come on. There you go.
  If you don't feel up to this, Heston would understand.
  Really, I'm fine. It's OK.
Better take our seats!
Come on.
What about Jimmi?
Elaine?
I'll catch you up.
  Let me know if you need anything else. Cheers, bye. Elaine?
  What have I done?
  What did I do?
  Let's take a seat.
  Was it because of me?
Poor Lauren!
I brought him to the Mill, I did this,
I brought him into her life...
Elaine, take deep breaths for me...
It's what I do,
  Harrison was my great achievement...
  What's going on?
I did this, it was because of me.
I pretend, but all the time, it's me.
  He's watching me and I can't get away!
  I've given her something for sleep.
  She should've taken time off.
  I should have not let her come.
  Don't beat yourself up.
It's my job to look after my staff and I'm not doing it.
You do just fine. Things affect people in different ways. You can't force them to accept help.
  I should have been more supportive.
  We can be supportive now.
Yeah...
I'm going to stay with her. How bad do you think this is?
Guilt, shock, fear... She's got a lot on her plate. It won't be a quick recovery, Julia.
  Wow, a rabbit. I love rabbits.
  It's Dougal.
Oi! Come here!
If you start getting into trouble, they'll take you away from us.
Is that what you want?
You've got big fat white spots at the back of your throat.
I'm 14 weeks pregnant, and I'm bleeding.
