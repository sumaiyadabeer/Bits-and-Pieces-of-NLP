64, 64 Zoo Lane...
Hello. I'm Lucy. I live at 64 Zoo Lane.
And I have some very special neighbours. Look.
There's one with a hump and one who can jump
And one who is... Well, a little bit plump
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Some like it hot and some like it chilly
And some like it both ways and that's a bit silly
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Some are friendly, some are scary
But one thing is sure, not one is ordinary
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
They're prickly and woolly and furry and slimy
Some are quite big and some are very small
And the last one's Georgina
Who's incredibly tall

  Bedtime, Lucy.
  OK, Mum.
Whee!
  Hi, everyone.
  Hello, Lucy.
  Guess what.
  What? What?
Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun, Lucy.
Yes! Except...
Except what?
Except for the rules. Our teacher has given us all these boring rules.
We have to walk in pairs and hold hands
and not forget our packed lunchboxes.
And listen to the teacher at all times.
  Oh.
  Oh.
  Oh.
  I see.
  I mean, how can a school trip be fun with all those boring rules?
Squawk!
Hi, Gunner. Nice to see you.
  Hello there, Lucy.
  Have you come with a story?
  Squawk.
  Yes, actually I have.
  Is it a story of a school trip?
Close, Nelson, but not quite. This is the story of a whale trip.
It was a sunny morning on Mossy Bay Island.
Hercule Moustache and Thelma the whale were on the beach, waiting.
Hmm, where are those puffins? Why are they always late?
I'm sure they'll be here soon, Hercule.
Good morning, Mr Moustache. Good morning, Thelma.
You were late again. Hmm! Well, at least you are here now.
Hello.
Hmm.
Ahem. No chatting when the walrus is talking.
No giggling.
And no bouncing!
Hmm!
Hmm. Today, we are going on a whale trip.
And you need to follow carefully the rules.
Also, it is very important that we do not lose anyone,
so I will count you, little puffins.
One puffin. Two puffin.
Three puffin. Four puffin.
Hmm.
Ahem. Look over there, little puffins.
An interesting wave.
Another interesting wave. And look, ho ho ho, this is fantastic!
Another one!
  What's that, Mr Moustache?
  Aha! That is Mussel Island.
Let's have a closer look.
Bla la la la.
Bla la la la.
Ha ha!
Bla la la la, bla la la, bla la la la, bla la la
Bla la la la, bla la la, bla la la la.
What shall we do with a grumpy walrus?

Early in the morning?
Way hay and up she rises Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises, early in the morning
Shave his moustache with a razor clam
Shave his moustache with a razor clam
Shave his moustache with a razor clam
Early in the morning.
No, no. I will not allow anyone shaving off my magnifique moustache.
Come on, little puffins. It is time to go.
One puffin.
Two puffin.
Three puffin. Four puffin.
Sail away, Thelma!
Now, we dive under the sea.
Yay!
'The puffins were amazed to see all the wonderful creatures
'at the bottom of the sea.'
Ah, no! Ah!
One puffin. Two puffin.
Three puffin. Four puffin.
This is an iceberg. It is a very big lump of ice and snow.
We need to be careful. No running.
Hmm.
'The puffins were very excited. They'd never seen ice before.'
'But it was getting late.'
Time to go home, little puffins.
Aw!
One puffin.
Two puffin.
  Three puffin.
  Wait!
Can I take this snowball as a souvenir, Monsieur Moustache?
  Please!
  OK. Now, where was I?
  You were counting puffins.
I was number three.
Ah, oui. Then you, little puffin, must be number four.
Sail away, back to Mossy Bay.
'But Hercule didn't realise he had left a puffin behind.'
  Oh, it's melting.
  Well, of course it is melting. It is made of snow.
Never mind, Jamie. Why don't we sing that sea shanty again?
What shall we do with a grumpy walrus?

Late into the evening?
Shave his moustache with a razor clam
Shave his moustache with a razor clam
Shave his moustache with a razor clam...
  Your turn, Lewis.
  Lewis?
Oh, no! How is this possible?
'Hercule realised they had left a puffin behind on the iceberg.'
  Quelle catastrophe! Turn around, Thelma! Quickly!
  All right.
Hold on tight.
Oh, no! All the icebergs, they look the same.
How will we find the little lost puffin?
It's that one! Over there!
  Lewis!
  Huh?
Hey! Do you like my snow sculpture?
  It's great.
  Super.
  Cool!
Ahem. Hmm.
Your sculpture, it is, ahem, magnifique.
And I am so happy to see you!
Way hay and up she rises...
'And then it really was time to sail home.
You know, the rules are there for a reason  
to make sure no one gets upset or hurt.
Or left behind on an iceberg.
But, Lucy, you haven't told us yet
Oh. You'll never guess. We're visiting...
  ..the zoo!
Sounds like you have a busy day ahead.
Good night, everyone.
Sweet dreams.
