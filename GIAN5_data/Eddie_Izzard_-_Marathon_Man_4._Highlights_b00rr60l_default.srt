This programme contains some strong language
Eddie Izzard is a comedian and happens to be a transvestite. He's definitely not an athlete.
But on 27th July 2009, at 47 years of age, Eddie decided to go for a run   a very long run.
His aim   to cover over 1,000 brutal miles around the United Kingdom, an incredible Sport Relief challenge.
I'm just some bozo who's saying, "I'm going to do this," and started running a couple of weeks ago.
I've run before, but mainly for buses.
He will run through England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland  
a marathon a day, six days a week, for eight weeks.
I'm interested in people. It's hopefully an adventure that can be fun.
But with little training, experience or preparation, this truly is a lunatic adventure.
If you carry on, you might not make it to the last day.
One man's mad struggle to run some of Britain's toughest terrain...
It's just me and my body, and "can I make it?".
..and attempt something truly extraordinary.
Contains some strong language.
Eddie Izzard is at the Olympic Medical Institute
First he meets Dr Mike Loosemore, a leading sports consultant.
Have a seat. Just tell me what you're going to do on this endurance event that you're planning.
I'm planning to run from...run round the UK.
I kind of think I should run.Yes.
I think I'm designed for running.
Sorry to go back, but as far as running is concerned, how much
actual running and training have you done up until this point?
I've done about two weeks' training. I did...
You're telling me you're not an habitual runner?No, no. No!
No, no.OK. And how long have you got before you do the run?
Going in four weeks on Monday.
Is that right?
For weeks on Monday, yeah.
Is this wrong?
Am I doing things wrong? You see...
I thought we had like nine months.
No, I don't want to do the nine months thing.
The Institute's director, ex Olympian Professor GregWhyte,
usually trains Britain's greatest athletes.
But in Eddie, he's got a 47 year old unconditioned comedian.
When he told me that he wasn't a seasoned runner, had very little running experience,
it becomes ludicrous, because what we have is only five and a half weeks' preparation.
He'll need to have superhuman stamina to rise to the challenge for Sport Relief, running 43 marathons,
a maximum of 30 miles a day, around the United Kingdom.
Running is healthy, it's very primal, it's what we came from.
And if it can help raise money for people who are still having a tough time,
then that will be a great thing. Really nice, really nice.
His route will take him from London to Cardiff,
Past Liverpool to Scotland, continue over to Belfast,
across Northern Ireland and finally head south from Glasgow back down to London.
It is a punishing journey, running marathon after marathon, day after day.
This is an incredibly difficult challenge, even for a seasoned endurance runner. Eddie isn't that.
Excellent, excellent, good lad, well done. Very nice indeed.
The results of the day's assessments are not good.
Although Eddie scored well on his fitness run that shows he has the
stamina of an average runner, his body is in poor shape, with limited balance and flexibility.
He also has a multitude of injuries and flat feet.
He's just not designed for constant running.
6am   the start of Eddie's incredible journey.
He'll be joined on his challenge by a sports therapist,
tour manager and a small film crew in a motorised rickshaw,
driven by Ted.
There's the option of... HE HONKS THE HORN
Oh, I love that! HE HONKS THE HORN
In five and a half weeks, I think we've managed to get him to the best physical shape that we can,
but it is only five and a half weeks
with a transvestite comedian who's neverhad any running experience, so...
Eddie wants the start to be low key.
A small support team from Sport Relief are waiting.
They're all relying on him to run as far as he can to raise money for the charity.
Yeah, my body wants to...
..evacuate its bowels a lot.
Here we go, kids. See you in 10 weeks!
To give Eddie a fighting chance, he has received pain killing
injections for his old injuries and orthopaedic trainer inner soles to help his flat feet.
Carrying a flag of the country he runs through,
only time will tell if his body can stand up to the gruelling pace of daily marathons.
This leg's talking to me a bit,
but you just have to ignore things.
I am testing what I can do, cos there are some people
who are brilliant sportsmen and they got up and were brilliant at six.
I was never brilliant. I was never brilliant at almost anything.
At everything, I've just slaved away and worked at and worked at.
People will look at this and think this is an impossible challenge. They won't be far from the truth.
The fact is that much of what these ultra endurance events come down to is attitude.
The desire to complete. And Eddie has that desire.
He really wants to complete this.
What I have spoken to the team about is trying to maintain this pace, maintain his focus.
That's the one thing they've really got to concentrate on is keeping him on track.
What are you doing? Just stopping for a sec?
I just want to get a Calypo, because...
It's very good.
Eddie seems to have forgotten he's got more than 1,000 miles to go.
Ignoring Greg's advice, he has stopped to do a little bit
of sightseeing at Virginia Water, a large lake.
You've got people picnicking.
It's nice. It's quiet and you've got water lapping. And is that a moorhen?
Two.
No, that's a duck. They're all ducks to me.
Greg will say, keep the place up. After a while, it's going to drive me mad.
That may be true, but maybe if I take my time, I feel like I'm on holiday. Oh, look, many ducks now.
Eddie has taken his time in the park,
confident enough to ignore the professionals and run at his own pace.
But he's still got six miles to go before he completes his first marathon.
He has no fear, because he's a transvestite.
When he walked in America in six inch heels and got
on the subway, you kind of lose the fear factor.
He is always wanting to push himself, I think, to find that fear.
And here he is.
At last, Eddie has finished his first 30 miles. Further than he has ever run before.
Now, champagne!
Down in one!
Cheers, Eddie.
Or two, maybe.Eddie celebrates his first of 43 marathons.
But by stopping, it's taken him 10 hours to finish and less time to recover before tomorrow.
Eddie keeps on running,
defying the experts to complete an extraordinary three marathons in three days.
But after covering 90 miles, the challenge begins to take its toll.
I haven't seen anyone for ages.
Everyone had disappeared, and I'd been running and trudging and having a bad time of it for about 10 miles.
I was really kind of pissed off off when I got to Devizes.
Come along! YOU'VE got to keep running!
Where you going?I'm going to Cardiff, then up to Belfast.
Cardiff? What's wrong with you?
What?Why would you run that far? It's good to run. It's for charity.
What? Cardiff   that's a long way to run.
Not just Cardiff, then all the way up through England
to Belfast, then across to Glasgow, Edinburgh, and back down to London.
Let me shake your hand, cos I think there's something wrong with you.
Thank you! I think you're probably right.You go and have some fun.
Eddie's ice cream van is already in Devizes, handing out free ice cream and raising money.
Do you know what I've done? Run from Trafalgar Square to here.
But this is great   thank you for building this town very quickly.
I should actually serve it. Does anyone want an ice cream? I'll make an ice cream for someone.
Eddie's getting carried away with the crowd
and forgets he's running a mega marathon around the UK.
Who's having ice cream?
He spends an hour serving ice cream and drinking beer.
Thank you very much.
Jo finally manages to pull him away from the crowd.
You all right? Eddie's got blisters on his feet  
an athlete's worst nightmare.
He's just got a couple of blisters now and he's got some pain on the arch of his foot.
So I'm just putting a bit of strapping around it here, to give him a bit of added support.
Without constant medical attention, his feet could become infected.
Eddie eventually decides to get on with the challenge,
but it's already 5pm, and he's still got another 13 miles to go.
He's chosen a shorter route to the finish, but he has no idea what the running conditions will be like.
The canal! Let's go down the canal.
Now we're going off road.
Soon, the path becomes too narrow for the rickshaw and support team to follow.
This means he is now out of communication for about the next 10 miles.
The only way to record his progress is for Eddie to use his phone to film himself.
I have to get to Bradford upon Avon before the sun goes down.
I'm keeping at about four and a half, five miles an hour, and this gravel is killing me.
Left alone and without the motivation of the rickshaw,
he battles to keep going and fights the excruciating pain.
Legs hurt,
feet hurt.
Am I crazy?
At 8pm and barely able to walk, Eddie finishes his fourth marathon.
Didn't know I was going to make that one.
Jo begins to treat Eddie's feet, but just removing the protective plasters is proving difficult,
as his skin is extremely tender.
One quick one, OK?Mm hm.
Ah!
Eddie's blisters are sacs of fluid caused by friction in his trainers
and aggravated by the rocky, loose surface of the canal path.
You can manage them.
They're much easier to manage when you're not doing an ultra endurance event, like Eddie.
Using a sterile needle, Jo begins to drain the fluid, taking care not to rip the skin.
It might just be that you have to put up with the pain on your toes for a couple more days.
If you can save my feet, then... I'll do my best.
Jo must prevent the blisters from spreading, to stop this becoming a challenge ending injury.
Eddie keeps running.
Usually, experts advise 26 days recovery after a marathon.
But Eddie defies the odds.
Running over the Severn Bridge to Newport, Wales,
will mark Eddie's 6th marathon in six days.
It's quite a thing.
It's an estuary, it's bigger than a river. It's bloody four miles.
He celebrates running from England into Wales
with his own personal flag changing ceremony.
Faced with the impossible task of another 37 marathons to go,
he focuses on the smaller challenge of climbing the mountainous terrain
of the Brecon Beacons, three marathons away.
But in Cardiff, on his first day off,
he's struck down with a fresh injury.
Wow! Arrgh!
Fingers crossed it's more that, and not ITB.
Why is ITB bad?
It's not(!)Tell me, I need to know. It's a long tendon.
There's not a great blood supply, so it takes a long time to get better.
Kim, a sports specialist, has joined for the day.
She's discovered that his IT band, a tendon runningdown the length of Eddie's leg is inflamed.
But the root of the problem comes from the blisters on his feet.
He's starting to drag his feet because he's so exhausted
and because his feet are hurting him so much.
When you do that, your running style changes,
your running gait changes, and you can start to get
aches and pains in your muscles and other various places.
With the pain increasing, his speed has dropped dramatically.
But Eddie prefers to keep running, risking further aggravation to his injury.
I am worried for him. Eddie seems to not want to walk a day.
And I think if he carries on running like this, he's going to burn himself out.
Come on.
Eddie crawls to his 7th marathon.
But the effects of running have taken their toll.
His IT band is worse and his whole leg has now seized up.
This is a very painful procedure.
A lot of people suffer from full leg bruising after they've had their IT band stripped.
Don't panic, that Eddie is like, crying.
But it's really, really good.
Aaargh!
One more, one more.
OK, OK. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
One more, one more.
OK, we're done, we're done.
Deep breaths.
When we came down, all of us,
the crew, everybody else, we were all sitting there, going,
"Oh my God, this is going to be horrific."
But then we all got together, had a little chat and said,
whatever happens, this is the day we really need to smile.
Don't matter how wet we get, how bad we feel, how cold we are
or how much we're missing home, we've got to really smile today.
This is...
day something or other.
No one is going to join me and run today unless they are mad.
On the positive side,
nothing...really.
Well, I've done seven marathons, that's positive.
Eddie trudges through the desolate landscape.
Every step, mental torture,
as he tries to ignore the pain in his legs.
But in Swansea, his luck finally changes.
This is what we want. This is summer.
Eddie has reached the Brecons. A huge achievement to run 200 miles in nine days from London.
But now, he must tackle the toughest terrain he has ever faced.He'll do a marathon today.
Why's that?He just won't let himself not do it.
They are famous for the military coming up here and people dying actually, from hyperthermia.
So they've got this mystique and a kind of scariness.
We've all been worried about him. There was a three mile hill that he had to climb
and, you know what? My car had trouble getting up it.
This hill has been going... for too long.
Probably at his weakest point, he was powering up this hill like...
I just couldn't... He just seems to be getting stronger and stronger.
The Brecon Beacons were going to be really scary.
When the weather went good, it eases it because you look around
at the hills and say, "Wow! How are these made? These look ancient."
At the reservoir, Eddie still has an uphill climb to the finish.
The hill just goes on and on and if I think about how far the hill is, then I start to slow down.
If I think about the end, I slow down.
I have to just think about something else and get out of it, otherwise you just won't make it.
Hello.
Bloody hell, guys.
It's really steep.
I'm going to throw it, OK?
I know, in the old days, before I started this run, I would have gone,
I'm not doing this. So I've changed my whole parameters.
The end! I can see the end!
Number nine.
Number nine. There's loads of flying ants!
Let's run from the flying ants.
Flying bloody ants.
I didn't ask for flying ants.
After yesterday's achievement
he is now determined to run 10 marathons in 11 days.
This is a big psychological time.
My body is actually getting better and acclimatising to running.
I am becoming this marathon man...
thing that I believed was out there.
I'd heard, talking to other runners, that you become a sort of machine.
And now the brain is linking up with the body saying,
that's what we're doing now. We're going to run all our life. It's just preparing for ever.
After yesterday's triumphant climb, the Brecon Beacons have only just begun.
Eddie has no choice but to take one road to the finish
which happens to be a gruelling ascent.
Run, walk or crawl.
Today I do ten marathons, come hell or high water, come rain or shine,
no matter what happens.
We'll do ten today.
To try and take his mind off the steep incline, he explains where his motivation comes from.
I came up with two lines as a transvestite, and they got me a long way.
Action transvestite and executive transvestite.
It sort of explained me.
I'm a transvestite but I will thump people if they give me a hard time
and I will run a marathon a day if I say I will.
You know...
..all the boy parts are boy, all the blokey parts I have
and then the girlie part as well.
I don't quite know why.
I don't at all know why,
but it's genetic, pretty damn sure.
And not my choice, just be truthful about it and get on with it.
People know I'm a transvestite.
Now they know what the action bit is.
The hills are relentless, but Eddie refuses to walk, determined to run at all costs.
I've never met someone so stubborn.
We're in the mindset that if he covers a marathon on foot every day
then that's a bloody achievement but...
Eddie is in the mindset that he wants to run it.
I think he thinks he'll be letting people down if he doesn't run.
Eventually, Eddie asks for the support team.
His body is broken.
There is some really bad terrain.
The hills coming up, Eddie, are awful. I'm not sure that it's worth doing it when you're tired.
I can't give up.
It's not giving up. Three miles from here.
If that's does me a marathon, I'll do that, then.
If that three miles takes you to the ridiculously steep hill that is like that  
you go down it and then up it   I'm begging you to walk it.
But once again, Eddie ignores the clear advice from the support team.
He continues to do it his way, and keeps running.
But it's not just Eddie who's struggling.
The last few hills up to Builth Wells,
the rickshaw had used all of the batteries we had.
It was looking like we weren't going to be able to actually catch the end of the marathon on the cameras.
The film crew got out and ran along with him, which is impressive in itself.
Builth Wells Running Club, and they were waiting for me and I'm so bloody slow they came to find me.
These are some tough hills. I'll carry the camera if you want to run on.
At the summit, Eddie completes his tenth marathon...
Please don't fall off.
..and decides to cycle into the local town to celebrate.
I should do this. This is good.
I liked making a bit of a rumpus, a bit of a circus coming to town,
because I grew up in Bexhill and not much happens in Bexhill.
It's Crazy Thursday!Yeah!
Eddie seems to have captured the hearts and minds of Builth Wells, drumming up incredible support.
People of Builth Wells!
I'm doing this for Sport Relief, it's a great cause. Thank you for turning out. Builth Wells!
Even dogs have turned out!
Eddie has run 277 miles in 11 days.
But he still has 890 miles to go.
I will finish, because I've decided
that, by hook or by crook, I will finish.
After a day's rest, Eddie keeps running,
and he's focused on the smaller challenge of making it to the Lake District, seven marathons away.
He has many happy memories of holidaying there as a boy,
and it's where he'll have his next day off.
He's going to spend a huge amount of time on the road on his own.
Being a competitive athlete, it is fundamentally miserable.
What he needs is support and he needs people around him.
But news of Eddie's mission is growing.
In Liverpool, 100 miles away, he begins to get much needed encouragement.
Go, Eddie! Go, Eddie! Go, Eddie!
Hi! I just think the word's out now.
I think we'll find as we go to bigger towns and cities
that more people know.
'I like doing one thing that does several things.'
Health, raise money, make an adventure, maybe inspire a kid.
High five!
I gave Eddie £2 out of my dinner money
because we don't need it as much as he needs it.
Two kids who cycled with me, and they kept saying
they wanted to go further, they wanted to go all the way.
Their mum has said, "Yeah, it's fine as long as they're safe."
We found two crash helmets.
We found two high vis jackets.
'That adventurer's spirit is great.'
That's what the country needs.
I thought, "If I was a kid, I would have loved that."
He's there. He's in a world of his won. He's not even tired.
Are you feeling tired? Yeah. I'm knackered.
Run fast for you mother fast for you father...
I'm going to tell my mum it could be the best day I've ever had.
The boys inspire Eddie to his 15th marathon.
He continues running his epic adventure
for another 50 miles to the Lake District.
This is a place that holds strong childhood memories for him
when he holidayed there as a boy.
Hell!
I thought it was the Lake District, not the Hell District.
He's also determined to finish today's marathon
to have a rest and play a special stand up gig
to say thank you to the public for all their support.
But as he struggles on,
a fan arrives in the most unlikely of places.
Eddie!
Hello.Hello.How are you?
I'm all right.
I was waiting for Dad to get showered
and he said, "I've seen Eddie Izzard run past."
"Go and run after him." I was like, "No, Dad."
He's like, "You're going to do it. Go on." I was like, "Oh!"
Six hours later, Eddie is left alone once more.
His route takes him around Lake Ullswater.
A mile from the finishing line, he spots something familiar.
Where are we, Eddie?
This is Ullswater.
This is the Outward Bound Trust entrance.
As a child, he came here on holiday with his brother.
It was a coming of age experience that made
a strong impression on his life.
I think it was the last time I did camping.
It's not exactly primal but it's getting back to that primal place,
which I just have missed.
30 years ago I was jumping in. I would jump in now but...
I've just run another mile!
Moved by his discovery, Eddie finishes his marathon...
18 marathons.
..and then returns to the lake he swam in so many years ago.
I need to put my legs into an ice bath,
up to a half an hour, not later than half an hour after I finish a marathon.
The freezing water will repair the damage he's done to his muscles after a marathon.
In the old days, at 7am when I was doing the Outward Bound course,
we jumped off this jetty into the lake.
And that was freezing.
As the present Outward Bounds class arrives at the jetty,
Eddie understands that this challenge has allowed him to
rediscover his childhood.
Well done!
This return rekindles old memories.
Finally, Eddie has a recovery day
and he can achieve his goal of performing an intimate stand up gig.
Hi. I'm a little exhausted, because I ran here from London.
They sometimes say, "Oh, you're jogging." And I go, "I'm not jogging. I'm fucking running!"
I've been meeting people, I'm trying to tap into the primal thing.
350 generations ago, we were hunting.
We know we're not designed for this...and a cake.
So I'm interested in us, ladies and gentlemen, the human beings.
The whole world, 6.5 billion of us.
I'm raising money for Sport Relief
and if you possibly could make a donation, um...
And I've met them on the road, ladies and gentlemen, and passed them,
and 99% of them are interesting, they blow their horns and wave. And 1% of them try to kill me.
I do have an image, which I'm trying to push away, of them just clipping me.
You know, "He was doing rea..."
You know, if they just clip me, that's it.
Bloody hell. One had a boat on it.
Bloody hell, that was scary.
See, if I step left, I'm gone.
Eddie has run another three marathons into the west of Scotland.
But he still has another 22 marathons to go if he's going to finish in London.
He must run along the congested A75,
With heavy lorries hindering his attempt to reach the port,
to catch a ferry to Northern Ireland.
But the conditions are deteriorating fast.
Running in this...
If I was crying, you wouldn't know.
Let's turn back.
Ha ha!
I've to just keep going through the rain, and on and on and on and on,
and then you can't think about it. If you keep moving, you keep warm.
If you stop for more than two minutes, you freeze.
It's not good.
And I don't like it and I want it to stop.
And then you can't see out of your eyes because the sun cream, which...
I have to put on sun cream in the morning, even though it's raining, in case it gets sunny.
That gets in your eyes and it's bloody miserable.
Ah, I can't even see now.
Bloody hell.
Eddie has been running for two hours and the rain is showing no signs of abating.
This is a single lane rode all the way to Stranraer with no pavement
and the heavy lorries to and from the port come perilously close.
I've seen so many dead things in the road.
A complete fox, his neck broken,
entrails spilled everywhere.
Ted got out and took the fox out of the road.
Yeah, instantaneous death.
Eddie has had one of his toughest runs,
but a break in the weather lifts his spirits to finish his 22nd marathon and on schedule to reach his ferry.
This last marathon today
takes me to Stranraer.
That feels quite an achievement.
To have finally got there, 23 marathons...
And that really is halfway.
For most runners, one marathon is enough.
But Eddie, an unfit and untrained comedian, has so far achieved the impossible.
He catches his ferry to Belfast and then runs his slowest ever marathon,
dragged to the finish by fellow runners.
Ah!
In the record total   about 12 hours.
Exhausted, he covers 90 miles in three days across Northern Ireland,
to Derry, Londonderry.
And I'm knackered!
He continues into Scotland, crossing from Glasgow to Edinburgh,
where press and friends are waiting to celebrate his achievements.
I'm coming along to remind people how hard it is.Right.
Although Eddie has run 700 miles,
he knows he's still got a long way to go.
He's on a tight schedule to complete 17 marathons,
462 miles to the finish, in just 19 days.
Given the difficulty of the challenge,
and where Eddie has come from,
if he makes this challenge, there's no doubt he will become iconic.
But the next three marathons are a lonely, excruciating climb
through the Scottish Borders.
And he's suffering from extreme fatigue.
I just know that over the top of that hill over there
there'll be another down, another up,
and another down.
But after two hours of running,
he finds a way of dealing with the monotony.
A 16th century castle becomes a welcome distraction.
The castle, aye, we shall storm it.
Welcome.Would you like to have a quick look inside?Yeah.
One of the last people who swept up here was her majesty, the Queen.
A really big moment. She was just hanging out?
He seems to have forgotten he's suffering from exhaustion,
and that he's only five miles into his marathon.
That's a blunderbuss there. For house coach.
Napoleon?Yes. Napoleon surrendered to an ancestor of mine.
Some of those walls are 13 feet thick.
Really?After 40 minutes, he's only halfway round the house
and it seems he could be here all day.
I think, Eddie, it's great that you're here.
I think that he would have reached a very senior rank in
the Army, cos he's a very talented, clever man
and the fact he puts on a dress would go down extremely well.
The Army, on many occasions, has its own comedy acts
in front of their own regiment.
Well, Captain, thank you.
OK.Appreciate it.Good man.
I salute him.
And you heard I was doing this? I follow your Twitter.Right.
So I thought,
"I'll come out and help you along a bit
"on the last couple of miles if you're getting tired."
No, it's great.
Andy, a soldier, lost the use of his legs
in a mountain climbing accident, after returning from Iraq.
He has covered 1,000 miles   the length of Britain   on his hand cycle.
You can do anything you want to do.
It just takes a lot of ingenuity,
normally some kind of specialist equipment,
and a lot of stubbornness,
but you can still go out and you can still do
anything you want to do.
Sooner than he'd like, he's back on his own and, with no towns en route
the last 15 miles will be a lonely battle.
It's difficult for Eddie,
because he has visions of popping off to see people.
What he doesn't understand is that he will get to a period of
time during this challenge where he can't lift his feet off the ground.
Really, what my job is to do, and the team I've handpicked around him,
is to keep him focused, keep one foot moving in front of the other.
The support team are waiting for Eddie at the finish, cooking him a steak dinner.
But seven miles away, steak's the last thing on his mind.
There are so many things that can go wrong
with ultra endurance events like this.
There's a huge number of psychological problems that these guys pick up,
to the point where they become so fatigued, they become delirious.
You see them drifting off the road. They do strange things.
Eddie finishes in 11 hours. He's a physical wreck.
Have you got steak? Yeah, we've got steak!
How would you like it cooked? Just stick it in my mouth.
It seems there's no way he can keep up this gruelling schedule
to make it to London in time.
That's the ice.
But he's not just suffering in the day.
If he's going to succeed at all, he will need to endure
a torturous 15 minute ice bath,
something he's had to endure every night.
Ice baths are very good.
Great athletes do ice baths so...
You can feel like a great athlete just by having an ice bath!
And er...
This freezing ice bath will help his muscles recover,
giving him a fighting chance of surviving the last 13 marathons,
to make a difference for Sport Relief.
Apparently, it's good.
Some people don't do it but, apparently, it's good for you.
Go on, Eddie!
A beautiful way to see your country. Life in the raw,
when you're on foot. You miss so much in a vehicle.
It's great, people are finding they're giving money.
It's an adventure.
Do you always last the distance?
No, a few times I've got out...
without getting too cold.
I don't know why. Sometimes it's colder than others.
But this night,
I would have got out.
I would have got out,
but you're here. So I can't get out.
I've just decided, I think I might have a bit of energy in the tank,
so I'm going to pick the speed up.
Come on, motherfucker!
Cake! Fucking move!
Oh, God!
Weee!
Pull the plug out. I'm trying to hold on to something.
Hello.Hello. Cheers. Cheers.
I just did over 22.5 miles
and I only came out to run about three miles,
then got caught along on the whole adventure.
Five more to go. Five more marathons. Only five more! A bagatelle.
Eddie's nightly suffering helps him run.
Eight marathons since Scotland and he's got five more to go.
He's racing to the finish,
as he's told the press he'll be in London in just six days.
But before he continues his challenge, he wants to visit
a Sport Relief project to see how the money raised will help.
Hello, hello.Hello. How are you?
I'm Eddie. Nice to meet you. I'm Eddie.
You're Eddie? Very good people.
Come and sit down.I will sit down.
I'm Colin.
Colin and Edward have Alzheimer's, a form of dementia which affects
over 400,000 people in the UK.
Some individuals can suffer from memory loss and problems with communication.
A lot of people have always thought it's an older person's disease.
Eddie was only 51 when he got diagnosed.
Eddie Izzard is just four years younger,
and while he's strong enough to run round the UK,
Edward struggles to live a normal life.
I can't read a clock now.
Me writing's gone.
Spells that are good and spells that are bad?Yeah, yeah.
It's a pain in't neck.
It's boredom that gets you.
Yeah.Cos you're used to working. You can't get a job.
Yeah, I thought my world had ended.
Can you imagine it?
You'll never work again.
I've worked all me life.
The illness took away Edward's independence,
but the Alzheimer's Society,
funded by Sport Relief, has given him advice and support.
It's the talking about it. I'm a transvestite.
I started talking about it and people went, "He can't be..."
It's a different thing, but it's the talking about it. Being open.
If you can help some of the others that's a bit worse,
cos that's what we do. We look after each other.
I'm glad you're fighting.
Very nice to meet you.
Don't you wear your legs off. No, I won't.
See you!
Inspired by the meeting, Eddie's more focused on his challenge than ever.
He's not content to run five marathons in six days.
He sets himself a new challenge
of completing the last day's marathon in his fastest ever time,
hoping to raise more money in the process.
What I need to do today, and tomorrow and the next day
and for the last five of these, is do not think about the end, really.
I've just got to go on and on and on.
By running so fast, he's pushing his body to breaking point.
Ah! Fuck!
No, that's not good.Oh, no!
Eddie's hurt his ankle and the more he runs on it,
the worse it seems to get.
I can put a compression bandage around it for you to run with,
but till the checkpoint, I want you to walk to the checkpoint, OK?
To the checkpoint? That's ten miles.
I know. I want you to walk to it.
If you carry on running, you might not even make it to the last day.
Is it worth it, really?
You think it's that serious then? Yeah.
Because if that goes, if that completely ruptures, that's it.
You won't even be doing your tour, cos you'll be on crutches.
I've got two more marathons before...
Not even a day off, but a day of not running.
That's nothing. It's only like 50 miles.
Think how many you've done.
He said to me, actually, in the van,
"Oh, I've done 38 marathons and nothing's happened.
"So I kind of thought I was a bit invincible."
But we've really shocked him into thinking,
"No, I am still a human and I have still got work to do."
But this is the biggest setback he's faced.
He knows if he can't run again, his chance of completing his
challenge and getting to London in time is over.
Well, I'll finish. I'll finish, come hell or high water, I'll finish.
At this pace he's in for a long night.
It'll take at least another four hours to get to Leicester.
Eddie's late. It's getting late. It's going to be our latest finish.
I feel really sorry for Eddie,
cos he's got a lot of miles to cover,
so he has to do a lot of running or walking.
But after 12 hours, Eddie emerges out of the darkness.
He's made it to Leicester against the odds.
I've decided to test it to see if it will work for tomorrow.
Thing is, if it doesn't work, I'm screwed.
He promised himself he would run round the UK and he cannot bear
to walk any more, risking his health and the whole challenge.
Only by running tomorrow will he know if his body will get him to the end.
I'm worried about being scared.
I'm scared of being scared.
If I start thinking, "This is going to be a problem," it could make it a problem.
He cautiously runs out of Leicester.
He knows if he's not careful, any step could be his last.
If I get it so I can't do the last day,
I'll lose it.
It's just, to go all the way round and not be able to finish
is, um...I just don't want to consider that.
Eddie's still under pressure to reach the finish.
He needs to run 100 miles in five days,
but his problems are soon put into perspective
when he's joined by a fellow adventurer.
The ankle's a bit weird.
You look terrific and you do so much good. You're the best.
You do more than if someone who
wasn't also funny and cheerful did it, because you spread the light.
Wow! Wow! You went round the bloody world!
That's right, but I was officially certifiable.
63 year old Rosie Swale Pope is a legend in ultra marathon circles.
She spent five years running 20,000 miles around the world.
I did it on a very low budget.
My husband had just died and I had not the heart
to go and see people and say, "Would you like to sponsor me?"
So I just used my savings, rent from the house and a small book advance.
And I just went and I figured I could just sleep in ditches.
I think the hardest thing was the fear of freezing to death.
The thing that keeps me going is the idea that I'm not going to stop
and I decided that at the beginning, like you did.
That's a beautiful answer.
My heart goes out to Eddie because of what he's going through.
It's just that he knows that he's doing it for a reason,
and I believe that Eddie's like me,
that if you're just doing it for your own personal self,
about how smart you'd be if you achieve a challenge, that's nothing.
Think of those children in Africa.
They've got everything that God gave them,
but nothing that people gave them.
Number 40!
Eddie completes his 40th marathon in one piece.
He tries to run as fast as he can to prepare for the final day.
But he cannot keep up the pace and struggles even to finish.
It's the final day of Eddie's incredible journey.
He'll be joined on his run by British Olympians and his trainer Greg Whyte.
Greg is worried that his attempt to run a personal best of under five hours
will be too much for his body to handle.
26 miles is still a long way.
The fact that he's already done 42 marathons
doesn't make any difference.
This is the fastest marathon I've run in my life.
This is one I can't really fail.
This one, we're trying to get the most publicity to raise the money.
This one I have get in five hours or just under,
so I can't actually muck it up.
Eddie will be followed by three rickshaws
which will attempt to film the whole race.
That's Thunderbird Three!
Take it a little faster?
Think of yourself like a metronome, doof doof doof. That rhythm.
And just keep it moving.
I'm very keyed up at the moment
and I have told people I'm going to do it, so it's out there.
The press are lined up there, so to get the most publicity, I can't be late.
Hundreds of people are waiting for Eddie at Trafalgar Square
and they're expecting a glorious finish.
But 40 minutes in, the streets become congested.
Hear that noise?
I don't know if that's good or bad.
And they're building up an impatient queue of traffic behind them.
I'm worried about this.
Just focus on what you're doing. Think about that metronome.
Everybody else can worry about the traffic.
If you do a normal marathon, the roads are blocked off,
there's no traffic, it's just runners and you're not even on the kerb.
Can you do this pavement?
You have to watch the kerb.
We're come down the pavement to relieve the traffic a bit.
It's very, very tight.
As the weather takes a turn for the worse, he loses the support of the Olympic pace setters.
Eddie, it's been a real pleasure.
All the very, very best. Thank you, man.
It's got to be the worst day we've had.
It's so bad, and he won't put a jacket on.
He's going to get bloody hypothermia.
After ten miles, Eddie arrives at a major intersection,
a maze of roads, and no clear route through.
OK. We're going down there, behind these buses.
Behind the buses!
We're on a big dual carriageway, over.
Agh, it's a mess.
Stay where you are.
We're not quite sure if this is the right route or not.
When the streets aren't cleared he has to negotiate pedestrians
he has to negotiate everything that goes on in London.
There?
Is it that way? OK.
Right, this way, guys.
The traffic jam costs Eddie precious time
and he's now down to just one rickshaw.
It tries to give chase on the pavement.
My time went right down.
I'm right on the edge of doing a five hour marathon.
When you challenge the body with 43 consecutive marathons,
things do start to go wrong.
My stomach is not feeling great.
13 miles in, Eddie has to stop. Constant running is playing havoc with his innards.
Any way I can use your loo?
As Eddie starts to fall apart, so does the last remaining rickshaw.
Axle's snapped.
I'm afraid that our rickshaw is out of the game.
By going off road, the rickshaw's wheel has fallen off.
Until help arrives, Eddie is running on his own.
I didn't know what was going on. I just remember,
"Keep going. I have to keep this pace up.
"Everyone has to find me."
Much of the time that he's spent doing this challenge has been
in the middle of nowhere, followed by you guys, in your rickshaw.
Now there's a huge amount of media that's on it
and he's said he's going to run a particular time
and that means he's got to hit that target. The pressure is on him.
The rickshaw is fixed and the film crew find Eddie waiting
at the new Olympic stadium in Stratford.
He didn't want to go further without the crew.
Well, look at it. There it is.
That whole place up there, regeneration.
We've got to go for it. Sometimes you just have to go for it.
And now I have to run like buggery.
The race is on.
By waiting, he might have lost his chance of breaking five hours.
He now has to push himself as hard as he can to make it in time.
So this is the last six miles.
Greg retires from the marathon,
with other runners taking his place to keep Eddie going,
but he's struggling to make up time.
So this it. Going over Tower Bridge. Running late.
I think we've got just under three to go and we've got half an hour.
I'm not thinking about anything. I'm just kicking it.
I'm just putting everything in it.
Whatever happens, I will finish this and I will try my damnedest
to finish this in under five hours and to get this to land perfectly.
This is the landing on the moon. This is D Day. This is it.
Look at the clock! Got 12 minutes!
12 minutes.
What he wanted to do was demonstrate that
not only has he run around the UK, but actually
he has run around the UK at a pace that people will respect.
You were never supposed to leave
Now my head's splitting at the seams
And I don't know if I can
I've come home...
I feel exhausted.
Eddie Izzard. Actor, comedian, now running legend.
He has run 43 marathons, 1,166 miles
and inspired millions of people around the UK
to rise to the challenge for Sport Relief.
It was rough.
I didn't make it.
Last word is, we started on a day kind of a little less rainy than this
and we wanted to come back on a bright, sunlit day
with the sun in the sky and children shouting.
But I'm going to sleep now for a week.
Morning.
We brought an ice cream van.
The best Magnum I've ever had, how about that?
