Welcome to the quiz show that demands perfection. Four contestants hope their knowledge is flawless
because one mistake could give the game away. This is Perfection.
Welcome to the quiz show where only perfect play is good enough.
Behind me are the contestants called the Usual Suspects.
In a moment, we'll find out which one has been randomly selected to join me here to play Perfection.
They'll then face a series of true or false statements. If I said...
..would you say that's true or false?
If you said "true", you'd be right.
Answering "true" or "false" might seem easy,
but if a contestant gets an answer wrong, their opponents join the game to capitalise on their mistakes.
So you know how the game works. Let's meet the Usual Suspects.
Hi, my name is Paul. I'm from Staffordshire. I'm an art teacher and this is my first game.
I'm Marc. I'm from Kingston upon Thames.
I'm an assistant programme manager. This is my first game.
Hi, I'm Jenna, I'm from Aberdare, I'm a lifeguard and this is my third game.
Hi, I'm Jane, I'm from Lancashire, I'm a housewife and this is my 13th game.
Welcome to you all. We now find out which one of you has been picked to play Perfection.
Jenna, you have been chosen. Please come and play Perfection.
  Jenna, welcome to the game.
  Thank you very much.
  Yes, I am.
  You look confident up there. It's more nerve wracking here.
  It is.
They're nice people, but they do loo intimidating up there.
Jenna, it's now you versus the Usual Suspects.
They're your enemies. They want to stop you from winning the prize fund
because your failure means the prize money rolls over and one of them could be playing for a bigger total.
Every game on Perfection is worth £1,000. The good news is nobody has won the past seven games,
so the prize fund currently stands at £8,000.
  That's a lot of money.
  It is a lot.
  What would you spend it on?
  First, I'd get a private jet home,
then after that, I'd have to treat the kids to a holiday to Florida.
It sounds a bit cliched, but it woul make their dreams come true.
You'll play three rounds, then a final. Each round that you achieve perfection makes the final easier.
But if it's less than perfect, the Usual Suspects can steal the round, making the final harder for you.
Usual Suspects, we switch you off, so you can't see or hear anything.
Each round consists of four true or false statements.
You'll only have 45 seconds and once you've given an answer, your first answer, it'll be locked in.
  Ready?
  I think so.
  Let's play Perfection.
Your 45 seconds starts now.
  I'd say "true".
  True.
  False. I'm sure it's the Sahara.
  False.
  It's false.
  False. And finally...
  I think that's true.
  True.
With loads of time to spare, you've answered all four statements.
  I've answered them all. I'm happy with that.
  Happy?
  Yeah, so far.
  Perfection, do you think?
  No.
  Which one are you worried about?
  I'm a bit dodgy with Bill Gates.
  I think he's older.
  Before we reveal how well you've done, it's time to bring back the Usual Suspects.
So, Usual Suspects, these are the four statements and next to them are Jenna's answers.
  Marc, has she achieved perfection?
  I'm not sure.
There's three that I would say were correct. The one I'm not sure about is Bill Gates.
  He might be a bit older than that.
  Do you agree, Jane?
  Yes, if I was to alter one, that would be the one.
Jenna, you need to have answered all four statements perfectly to have won the round. How many are correct?
  Yes!
  Congratulations, Jenna. You have achieved perfection.
What a fantastic start! Let's look at those answers in more detail.
A true statement turns green. If it's false, it turns red.
"Bill Gates was born in the 1950s." You said "true".
It is true. 1955, in actual fact.
  "The Kalahari is Africa's largest desert." You thought?
  The Sahara.
So you said "false" and it is false. Yes, the Sahara is the largest.
"Richard Curtis wrote Slumdog Millionaire." You said that was false. It is false.
Simon Beaufoy wrote the screenplay.
"A millimetre is one thousandth of a metre."
You said "true" and it is absolutely true.
Jenna, you've made winning the prize fund a lot easier and here's how.
Here is your final board. The six blank spaces need to be filled with subject categories.
Here are your final round categories, starting with Rappers,
going through Presidents and War Poetry to Mythology.
Because you won the round, you can choose two categories, so which two do you fancy?
None.
  I'll go with Oceans, please.
  Oceans goes across.
  And Paintings.
  Paintings goes across Thank you very much.
Usual Suspects, we'll see you in the next round. In the meantime, we'll switch you off. Away they go.
  Not happy with that board?
  No.
  Nothing you like?
  No.
If it was Rugby Players instead of Cricketers or Pop Music instead of Rappers, I'd be happy.
  Which ones do you really not want to get?
  Mythology would be rubbish. War Poetry would be rubbish.
I don't know why I've skipped Food Books. That would be rubbish as well
  You've made a great start.
  Luck of the draw.
Let's find out how it goes. Let's play Round 2.
Your 45 seconds starts now.
  True.
  True?
  True.
  True.
  False.
  False.
Oh, I'm rubbish at Shakespeare.
  I'd say "true".
  True. And finally...
  False.
  False. You've answered all four statements.
Once again, you see...
  What's going on with the face?
  I'm not sure about D, really.
I can't even think of the song I'm singing in my head.
Before we find out how well you've done, it's time to bring back the Usual Suspects.
These are the four statements and Jenna's answers. Paul, has she achieved perfection?
She's got a good chance of getting perfection. D is the one that I'm not sure about.
  Marc?
  I disagree with Paul.
Party Rock Anthem doesn't sound like an N Dubz song,
but I'm not definite on that.
Jenna, you need to have answered all four statements perfectly to have won the round. How many are correct?
  Oh, my God!
  Congratulations, Jenna. You have achieved perfection.
  Oh, wow!
  Check you out, as they say!
  Well, you know...
  Let's have a look at those answers.
"Manga comics originated in Japan." Of course, that is true.
"Gavin Henson was married to Charlotte Church." You said "false" and it is false because...?
  They got engaged, but split up three weeks later.
  Absolutely right.
"Cymbeline is a Shakespeare play." It is true.
"Party Rock Anthem was a UK No.1 single for N Dubz."
You said that was false and it is false.
  Yeah.
  ..were responsible for that masterpiece.
Jenna, as a result of that perfect performance, you've made winning the prize fund a lot easier.
The first two subjects were chosen by you and as you won that round, you choose the next two categories.
What do you fancy out of that lot?
  I'm going to go with Cricketers cos my sport's OK.
  Cricketers goes across.
And...Curry.
  Why not?
  And Curry goes across.
Lovely. Usual Suspects, no look in so far. Bit rough on you, isn't it?
  She's doing very well.
  She's doing well, unfortunately for us.
  Yeah.
I'll switch you off for now, but we'll see you in the next round. Away they go.
  You've got them worried.
  Yeah.
  Ready to play the next round?
  I am.
  Let's play Round 3.
Your 45 seconds starts now.
That doesn't ring any bells to me.
  I'm going to say "false", Nick, please.
  False.
I've got a doubt. There's something in my mind.
  False. I'll go with my first instinct.
  False.
  That's true, yeah.
  True. And finally...
  I'm going to say "false", please.
  False.
And again with time to spare, you've answered all four statements.
  Good, bad, indifferent?
  It's hard...
When you get something into your head, it's hard to battle your first thoughts.
Like David Beckham, something came into my mind that he did...
But I really don't know. I really... That's the toughest one so far.
Before we reveal how well you've done, it's time to bring back the Usual Suspects.
These are the four statements and Jenna's answers.
  Marc, has she achieved perfection this time?
  I don't think so.
I'm fairly confident David Beckham went on loan to Preston North End.
Before he broke in the first team, I think he went out on loan there.
  Paul, what do you think?
  Yeah, David Beckham played for Preston early in his career
to give him some playing experience.
But the other three I think are right.
Jenna, what's interesting here is that we have never had a player
get completely correct answers in all three rounds. If it happens here, you set a new record.
Let's find out how many are correct.
  Oh!
  Three out of four is not bad, but it's not perfection,
so you've let the Usual Suspects into the game.
Usual Suspects, you can steal the round. You need to change one of Jenna's answers, but which one?
  I think we'll go with B.
  Can we go with B, Nick?
Changing B from "false" to "true", leaving A, C and D as answered by Jenna.
Let's find out what the correct answers are.
"The Battle of Crecy took place in World War I." True or false?
False. It was in fact in 1346.
Way, way earlier. "David Beckham played for Preston North End." This is crucial. Is that true or false?
True. 1995.
"Dubai is part of the United Arab Emirates." True or false?
Yeah, it's true. You know where this is going.
"Anna Karenina is a book by Emile Zola." True or false?
It is false. Congratulations, Usual Suspects. You have achieved perfection.
Anna Karenina was, of course, by Tolstoy.
Let's see the final board.
Because you won the round, Usual Suspects, you can choose the last two subject categories.
  What do you think will trip her up?
  I don't know. Presidents?
  I was thinking Mythology.
  I think Presidents might be quite difficult for her.
  Presidents?
  Can we have Presidents, Nick?
Presidents goes across and we need one more.
  Mythology?
  I think so.
  And Mythology, please.
And Mythology goes in. We now know our six final categories.
OK, guys, time to switch you off for the final time. And away they go.
OK, Jenna, for £8,000, it's time to play the final.
Jenna, this is the all important final. If you achieve perfection, you could be leaving with £8,000.
If you fail, you leave with nothing which would be great news for the Usual Suspects
as one of them could play for a rollover of £9,000 on the next game.
  Ready?
  Yeah, I'll give it my best shot.
  Let's play the final round.
Jenna, here are your six final categories.
  You must answer all six statements correctly to win the £8,000.
  Yeah.
  There's no time limit, but once you've given an answer, it's locked in. Ready?
  Yeah.
  Good.
Let's reveal your first statement. Tell me if it's true or false.
I'm going to say... Oh, gosh, Ecuador!
  I'm going to say "true".
  True.
That means absolutely nothing to me.
Again...
  I'll go "true". It sounds nice together.
  True.
I should know this. I recently watched a programme about Ian Botham.
  I'm not 100% again. I'm going to go with "true".
  True.
I'd like to go if it is.
Again I'm not 100% at all, Nick, with any of these.
  It would be nice if it's true. I'll say "true".
  True.
Gosh!
I do believe that is true.
  True?
  Yeah.
  True.
Again I... That means nothing to me.
I've got all "true" on the board.
  I'll say "false", just to throw one in the mix.
  False?
  Yeah.
  Jenna, those answers are locked in. If there is one mistake, you leave with nothing.
  Yeah.
  Which ones are you unsure of?
  A, B, C, D, E and F.
That bad, was it?
Yeah. I don't know. "A" isn't too bad.
I was thinking Pacific Ocean, but then I'm sure that was Uruguay over on the Pacific.
Ecuador... Maybe "A".
The rest, I really wouldn't have a clue.
Let's bring back the Usual Suspects to see what they've got to say.
So, Usual Suspects, you can now see the final six statements and next to them are Jenna's answers.
You can't change your answers on your own, but if you think you've made a mistake, you can unlock them
with the help of the Usual Suspects, but at a cost.
Usual Suspects, I'm going to ask you to tell me how well you think Jenna has done,
if you want to help and how much it will cost.
  Jenna, who would you like to hear from first?
  I'll speak to Jane first.
You've done very well, considering the rotten categories you had.
There's one I would possibly change, but other than that, they seem all right.
There's a lot of money bouncing around here   £8,000. Would you come down for some money or not, Jane?
Um...
No, I don't think I would. I'm not confident enough in my own thoughts and answers.
  Who would you like to hear from next?
  We'll go to Marc now.
Hi, Jenna. There's a couple of questions that I'm unsure of.
Especially being the first game, I'm really not sure I could come and help you.
  Not for any amount of money?
  Not even if you offered me £7,000, I wouldn't want to.
  Ruling himself out.
  Yeah. Paul?
I think you've got four correct. There are two I'm unsure of.
But I don't know the answer to be able to help you.
I would come down for money to help you if I knew the answers, but there are two I'm very unsure of.
So none of you are prepared to come down? Paul?
  No.
  Marc?
  No, I don't think so, sorry.
  Jane?
  Not this time, no.
I'm afraid negotiations have been concluded by them. None of the Usual Suspects are willing to help.
It doesn't necessarily mean it's all over yet. £8,000 at stake.
Six answers away. Let's find out if you've achieved perfection.
  Are you feeling confident or not?
  I thought someone would come down.
  Especially with all that money.
  Yeah. Especially if they're unsure of two.
It's worth a shot. What's to say they don't get called up next time and the money goes?
Paul, which two did you think that you would change?
I'm not completely certain about "A"
and I'm not completely certain about the last one.
I've got a doubt about C as well. Ian Botham may not have done 50 Tests.
You might have changed A, C and F. Let's see whether you should have come down for some money
or whether Jenna's done it on her own.
"Ecuador is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean." You said "true".
If you're right, it will turn green. Is it true or false?
It's false, I'm afraid. You've fallen at the first hurdle. Pacific Ocean.
  You had a think about that.
  I did, yeah.
  And plumped the wrong way in the end.
That's one of the ones Paul would have changed. Let's push on. Perhaps you can achieve perfection at home.
"The Birth of Venus is a work by Botticelli." True or false? You said "true".
It is true. Absolutely right.
This was the next one Paul said he might have changed.
"Ian Botham captained England in over 50 Tests." You said this was true. Is it true or false?
  It's false. He was only captain in 1981 for a year.
  Was he?
  Yeah, not very long at all.
Maybe if Paul had come down and helped out, you might be in with a chance of the money.
"The Balti Triangle is a restaurant area of Birmingham." You'd head in that direction if it is true.
True or false? True. That's you off to Birmingham then!
My husband likes a curry, so I'll treat him there.
"Bill Clinton was US President for two terms." Is it true or false?
  Yeah.
  '93 to 2001, yes, it's absolutely true.
So we finally get to F and this is the other one Paul said he would change if he came down.
"Ares was the Greek god of war." You said "false".
Paul would have got you to change it to "true" and at this point we would be saying,
"So for a share of £8,000 for the two of you,
"is it true or false?"
  It's true.
  Oh, Paul!
The two of you would have been walking off with £8,000 between you. Paul, how are you feeling?
Gutted. Gutted for Jenna.
  £4,000 or £5,000.
  Yeah, I could have gone up to six.
  Could have gone up to six. There you go.
Usual Suspects, it is good news for you. The prize fund rolls over to the next game
where one of you could be playing for a total of £9,000.
Well, I wonder though, Paul? Was that your best chance to grab the money?
  Jenna, you failed to achieve perfection.
  Never mind. I had fun.
  I enjoyed myself.
  Unfortunately, you're going home with nothing. We've loved having you here.
  Jenna, ladies and gentlemen!
It's now time to meet the next Usual Suspect hoping to play Perfection today.
New Usual Suspect, please introduce yourself.
  I'm Helen from Derbyshire and I'm a trainee hypnotherapist.
  Welcome, Helen. No hypnotising the others!
  I'll try not to.
  That's definitely against the rules.
We now find out which one of you has been picked to play Perfection.
Marc, you've been chosen. Please come and play Perfection.
Marc, welcome to the game. Tell us more about yourself. Family, interests?
I come from Essex originally. I now live in Kingston upon Thames with my girlfriend.
I'm a massive Spurs fan. I play a lot of pool.
It's you versus the Usual Suspects. They were your team mates. Now they're your enemies.
Every game on Perfection is worth £1,000. Here's the good news.
  As nobody has won the last eight games, the prize fund currently stands at £9,000.
  Good number!
Nine is an awful lot of money. What would you spend the money on if you walked out with £9,000?
  A bit of travelling and pay off my overdraft.
  That's always handy.
  It's not so long ago that I was a student.
  So still paying off that.
Three rounds and a final. The Usual Suspects, we'll switch you off.
As soon as Marc makes a mistake you'll be back in the game.
  You can talk through your answers without giving away vital info. Ready?
  Ready.
  Let's play Perfection.
Round 1. Your 45 seconds starts now.
  I'm pretty sure I've seen a trailer for this. I'll say True.
  True.
  It's not. I did a chemistry degree. That is False.
  False.
I've not got a clue. Eamon sounds Irish, but de Valera doesn't.
  I'll go for True, please.
  True. And finally...
My birthday's January 31st and my sister's is February 6th. I don't know if it goes to the 14th.
  I'm going to risk False.
  False.
And with just a few seconds to spare, you've answered all four.
Good use of the time there.
  Happy with that round?
  I'll end up kicking myself if D is wrong.
I'm not sure. My sister's birthday is the 6th and she's Aquarius, but I don't think it goes to the 14th.
All right. It's time to bring back the Usual Suspects.
  They'll be able to hear you.
So these were the four statements and next to them are Marc's answers.
  Paul, has he achieved Perfection?
  I don't think so. I think D is true.
  Helen, what do you think?
  I think he's right.
  You do?
  I think the fourth one is Pisces.
Right. OK, Marc. A mixed bag there from the Usual Suspects.
You need all four correct to win the round.
Three out of four is not bad, but it's certainly not perfection.
You've now let your enemies into the game. Usual Suspects, you can now steal the round.
  You need to change just one answer.
  It's D.
  Because I am a Pisces.
  So D is true.
  Aquarius is before Pisces.
  Right, OK.
  It's definitely D.
  Can we change D, please, Nick?
  Change D from False to True, leaving A, B and C.
Usual Suspects, let's find out the correct answers. Green is true, red is false.
X Men: First Class stars James McAvoy. True or False?
Yep, it's true. Carbon dioxide is an element. Is it True or False?
  It is false. What is it, then?
  It's a compound.
  Exactly right.
It is a compound. Eamon de Valera was an Irish politician. Is that True or False?
Yes, despite your misgivings, it is true.
And someone born on February 14th is an Aquarius. True or False?
Absolutely true. Congratulations, Usual Suspects. You have achieved perfection.
The last day of Aquarius is the 19th.
Usual Suspects, you now have the opportunity to make Marc's chances that much harder in the final.
This is your final board. These blanks need to be filled with categories.
Here are your final round categories.
Formula 1, Royals, Wrestlers, Dickens and on to Explorers.
Because they stole the round, they choose two categories.
  Which two would you like Marc to play in the final?
  I think Eurovision would be a good one.
I don't think Marc's interested in Eurovision. I'd be surprised.
  Can we have Eurovision as the first one, please?
  Eurovision goes across.
  What about Explorers?
  Birds?
  And Birds, please, Nick.
And Birds goes across. Well done. You've won the first round. We'll see you in Round 2.
And away they go. With the Usual Suspects gone, are you a big Eurovision fan?
  Do you throw a party?
  When I was younger, I'd watch it with my mum every year,
but it's been going for many years and anything old I'd struggle with.
  Birds?
  I don't think it'll be the type of birds I know about.
So yeah... I shouldn't have said that.
  You'll get in trouble when you go home.
  Yeah.
  All right.
  It's only the first round. You still have two more. Ready for the next?
  I am.
OK. Let's play Round 2.
Your 45 seconds starts now.
  1700s. I'm pretty sure that is False.
  False.
  Yeah, I've been there, I think. I think it's True.
  True.
  I only know her as American. Can't think she'd be born anywhere else. I'm going to go with True.
  True.
And finally...
I'm pretty sure that it was a bloke, in which case that's False.
  I can't remember his name, but False.
  False. And with time to spare you've answered all four.
  That was a good round.
  Not too bad.
  You seemed very confident.
  You never can tell, though.
All right. It's time to bring back the Usual Suspects.
  These are the four statements With Marc's answers. Helen, is that perfection?
  No.
I think C's wrong. I don't think she was born in the USA.
Marc, the moment of truth. You need all four to win the round.
Yes!
Congratulations, Marc. You have achieved perfection!
Let's have a look at those answers.
Oliver Cromwell lived during the 18th century. You said False and it is false.
1599 to 1658.
The Lanes is a famous shopping area in Brighton. You said True.
It is, of course, true. Nicole Sherzinger was born in the USA. That is true.
  Hawaii. I think that's what you were thinking, Helen.
  Yeah.
Mary Tourtel created Winnie the Pooh. You said False.
And it is false. AA Milne is who it was.
OK, bad luck, guys. He did very well.
He shut you out and as a result you've made winning the prize fund a lot easier.
Two subjects already chosen for you, but because you won that round
  you choose the next two categories. What do you fancy?
  It's got to be Formula 1 and the Olympics, please.
Formula 1 goes across. And Olympics goes across.
I don't think that's any surprise to the Usual Suspects, who I'm now going to switch off.
  Away they go. Well done. Ready to play the next round?
  I am.
Good. Let's play Round 3.
Your 45 seconds starts now.
  He's clever. He's clever. I'll go True.
  True.
  True.
  True.
As a Spurs fan... Yes, I'm pretty sure they are.
  I think they're first cousins, in which case True.
  True.
And finally...
  She's got to have been beheaded. False.
  False.
And again with time to spare you've answered all four.
  Another good round?
  I'm pretty sure on B, C and hopefully D.
  A may be the tricky one, but hopefully quite good.
  Before we reveal how you did,
it's time to bring back those Usual Suspects. So these are the statements and Marc's answers.
  Helen, has he achieved perfection?
  Yes, I think he has.
  Paul?
  I think he's probably achieved it.
  I'm a bit unsure about D.
  Jane?
  I think he has. I think he's achieved perfection again.
I think the Usual Suspects think you've achieved perfection!
The moment of truth. You need to have answered all four statements perfectly to have won the round.
Let's find out how many are correct.
Just two out of the four! That isn't perfection.
As a result, your enemies are back in the game. Usual Suspects, can you steal the round?
  You need to change two answers, but which two?
  Michael McIntyre may not have been at Cambridge.
I'm pretty sure he's got Hurt Locker right. He will have seen that.
  And he knows his football. So shall we change...?
  A and D.
Can we change A and D, please, Nick?
A changes from True to False, D changes from False to True, leaving B and C as answered.
Let's find out the correct answers.
Michael McIntyre studied at Cambridge University. True or False?
False. He didn't go to Cambridge at all. He's just a bit posh.
The Hurt Locker is set in Afghanistan. True or False?
It's false!
Usual Suspects, you failed to achieve perfection. Can you still achieve it at home?
It wasn't set in Afghanistan. It was set in Iraq.
Jamie Redknapp and Frank Lampard are related. True or False?
Yep, they are cousins. You knew that.
Marie Antoinette died of natural causes. True or False?
False. She was, as you thought, executed.
Let's look at the final board. Four subjects   two chosen by the Usual Suspects, two by you.
As nobody won Round 3, we have two blanks to be filled.
You will take it in turns to choose a category.
  Marc, you get to choose first. Which one do you fancy?
  World War Two.
World War Two goes across. And, Usual Suspects, one category from you to make up the six.
  Royals?
  That could trip him up.
  Royals.
  Royals. Could we have Royals, please, Nick?
Yeah, Royals goes into the final. We now know our six categories.
Usual Suspects, time to switch you off for the final time.
  What do you make of the board?
  Not a massive fan of the Royal family.
All right, Marc, for £9,000, it's time to play the final.
Marc, if you can achieve perfection you could be leaving with a prize fund of £9,000.
If you fail, you leave with nothing, which is great for them as one could be playing for £10,000
on the next game. Let's play the final round.
Marc, here are your final six categories.
You must answer all six correctly if you want to win the £9,000. There's no time limit,
  but once you've given an answer, it's locked in. Ready?
  Ready.
Let's reveal your first statement. Tell me if it's True or False.
I'm pretty sure that this is Blue,
  in which case that would make A False.
  False.
They're big. They're big. I don't think there's a bigger bird that I can think of.
I'm going to have to go with True.
True.
I've heard of the circuit. I can't think of any other Spanish. Or is Interlagos Brazil?
  I think it's Brazil. I'm going to go False.
  False.
That would make 1996 the centenary. I think it's True.
True.
Never heard this before. Never heard this before.
There was quite a lot.
But they could have been the few lucky ones. That makes sense.
  True.
  True.
She certainly doesn't look it.
She must be getting on for around 30 odd. They were at uni together.
I don't think she looks it.
I'm going to have to go...False.
False.
Those answers are locked in. One mistake and you leave with nothing.
  Which ones are you unsure of?
  F is the one I'm really unsure of. And E could be anything.
  So E and F are worrying you.
  Probably.
  Let's bring back the Usual Suspects to see what they say.
You can now see the final six statements and Marc's answers.
Marc, your answers are locked in, but you can unlock them with the help of the Usual Suspects.
  This will come at a cost. Who would you like to hear from first?
  Jane.
I'm not sure whether you've got two of them right, to be quite honest. The rest look OK.
  Would you like to come down and help?
  I'd have to discuss it and pull it together between us.
  So there is a possibility?
  Yeah.
  OK. I'll go to Helen next.
  There's definitely one wrong. I'll help if you want.
  For how much?
  There's £9,000 in the prize fund.
  Three.
  You want £3,000.
  That's an interesting offer.
  I'll go to Paul, but might come back.
I'm not sure enough about some of them to be able to help. There's a few I'm unsure about.
  I couldn't come down to help.
  Paul's ruling himself out. Helen thinks you have one wrong.
  Are they telling the truth? Bluffing?
  How confident are you?
  I know for sure there's one wrong.   You definitely know the answer.
OK, I'm pretty confident on four. For £3,000, I'll make that deal.
  Yeah, I'll go.
  As quickly as that, negotiations have been completed.
Helen, for £3,000 of the £9,000 prize fund, please come down and join us.
OK, Marc, you asked Helen for help. It will cost you £3,000 of your potential prize fund of £9,000.
  Helen, you've forfeited your chance to play. The right decision?
  Yes!
Oh, you're very confident. Here are the final round statements.
All six answers are now unlocked. Which answers do you want to change?
The one I know for definite is F. Kate Middleton is definitely older.
That sets my heart a bit better. I'm happy to change that.
  Let's change F from False to True.
  OK, F is changing from False to True.
It's all your decision here. You don't have to listen to Helen.
  But you can have a discussion.
  Let's go through them. A was Blue.
  Definitely Blue.   I can't think of a bigger bird.   Ostrich?
But emus are huge. Remember Rod Hull? It was huge.
  But ostriches are huge, too.   Maybe...
Let's come back to it. Interlagos.
  Definitely that's false.   OK. And modern Olympics is 1896.
  Yes, I think so.   Do you know about The Few?
  No, I leave that one to you!   It could be the few lucky ones.
That makes sense to me. The few lucky ones who got away.
So let's go back to B. Change emu?
Emu or ostrich? Ostriches are huge.
  They're both huge!   If you were here and I wasn't, what would you go for?
  Emu.   You would have gone for emu?
  They're so big, both of them.   OK, stick with it.
  We'll kick ourselves if we change it.
  £9,000 at stake.
It might be ostrich, but we'll stick with those answers.
  Lock the rest of them in?
  Yeah, lock them in.
OK, the rest are locked in. £9,000 at stake.
£6,000 to Marc, £3,000 to Helen. Let's find out if you have achieved perfection.
  We could be totally wrong!
  If it turns green, it's True. If it turns red, it's False.
The boyband Five sang the UK's 2011 Eurovision entry.
You said False. Helen agreed 100% with you.
  You think it's...
  Blue.
  You think it's Blue.
You need this to turn red. Is it True or False?
It is False!
Yeah, it turned red because it is Blue.
Now this you ummed and ahhed about. The emu is the world's largest living bird. It might be ostrich.
You had a good think about it. You stuck with Marc's original answer of True.
This has to turn green to continue towards
that wonderful sum of £9,000. We haven't heard from you, Helen. What would you spend it on?
  I want to give my daughter money for driving lessons and help with my mum's care home fees.
Let's go back to it. The emu is the world's largest living bird.
You stuck with Marc's original answer of True. You need this to turn green
to be a third of the way to the money. Is it True or False?
  It is False.
  It's ostrich.
  Oh...
  I'm afraid the world's largest living bird is the ostrich.
  Ostrich!   Knew it.
Marc, Helen, I'm afraid you didn't achieve perfection, so you won't get the cash.
Can you achieve perfection at home? Let's run through the rest.
The Spanish Grand Prix is held at Interlagos. You said False. You think that is Brazil.
Is it True or False?
It is False and it is the Brazilian track.
The modern Olympics were first held in 1896. You said that was True. This should turn green.
  Absolutely right.
  I'm hoping this is wrong!
  If you can arrange that!
The Few refers to the men evacuated from Dunkirk. You said it was True.
You hoped it meant those who were rescued were the lucky few. Is it True or False?
It is False, so there you go. It's quite reassuring that it wasn't just that one.
In actual fact, it refers to the Battle of Britain pilots.
  "Never have so many owed so much to so few." They became known as The Few.
Yeah, it is True, so there you go. It would have been heartbreaking
  if you'd only missed out on that one.
  The ostrich!
  It's strangely slightly better.
  It is. I'm happy.
Usual Suspects, the prize fund rolls over to the next game where you could play
for a total of £10,000!
Marc, Helen, you failed to achieve perfection and you both go home with nothing.
I hope you've enjoyed playing. Ladies and gentlemen, Marc and Helen!
That's all we have time for. Please join us next time when our Usual Suspects play again
for £10,000, but remember on this show we only pay
