with the next The Record Review. These days navigating a difficult
market is harder than ever before. So do you go for the easy option
and go for a property with no work needed? Or do you take a chance on
a wreck with the potential to become your perfect pad?
I'm here too prove that buying a renovation project is the best way
of getting hold of your dream home. But I think today's property market
is full of great homes that are ready to move into straightaway.
It is our job to help house hunters make up their minds. Can I dare
today's buyers to take on one of my wrecks? Or will they play it safe
wrecks? Or will they play it safe and have one of my readies?
Today we are searching searching East Sussex, centre around the
ancient town of Battle. House prices are on the up rising
£335,000 that's way under the We're here to fin the perfect
family home for Jeff and Claire who works part time as cabin crew for a
long haul airline. They want to get their new lives in East Sussex off
They celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary and are desperate to
find a home to to call their own. They need help widening their
search beyond where they live, but with great property selling fast,
they have decided to call in the experts.
Who wants the do upper? And who The garden is not ideal in the
summer for them. It is on three levels.
I I would love a good sized garden with a plait level area of lawn
where we can kick a ball about. I think what will impress them is
land. I would like it to be big enough to
justify a ride on mower. I always wanted one.
That's that about? I want a ride on mower. I live in a flat in London.
I wouldn't consider an ugly property.
Bungalows turn me off. It would need need four bedroomed.
They want the lot. They want the lot in an expensive part of the
world, but they are mentioning the thing that is always going to hold
up property prices, good schools and the catchment areas and that is
going to stretch the budget. Especially when you are looking for
land. I would consider a wreck. First
Firstly, the potential gain that we might get in terms of value.
I would like something that's that's easy to move in. I try
really hard to makure make our lives as stress free as possible.
It is always the lady who has to bring it back to reality.
Claire will probably win because she is more sensible than I am.
I think you will win if Johnny can find something within budget that
would let me stay in this house while the work was done in the
wreck. Good luck! She looks like a hard task master.
Let's go. She certainly does!
Jeff wants a wreck and Claire wants a ready. They are looking for a
detached house with four bedrooms. That's close enough to good schools
for the kids. Jeff wants a big garden, big enough
for a sit on lawn mower. Claire wants something with kerb
appeal. And all that with a budget of
£650,000. Finding Jeff and Claire a ready is
one thing, but something that's going to beat what they have got,
that's going to be the toughy here. I love a challenge and can
understand why Claire wants out of rented and into a home of her own.
Getting a wreck with enough potential will come at a cost.
We have got a great budget, but massive aspirations for a new home.
By the looks of it, Claire doesn't want any piece of a wreck.
I can't help but think I am at a disadvantage on this one. Wreck
with enough kerb appeal to satisfy Claire are hard to come by, but I
can only show them what's on the market so for the first property I
am hetting out to Pett. This chase has a charming sleepy feel.
Unfortunately, there is no local school in the village, but it has
great access to this wonderful peb bli beach.
What about the house itself? right. All right. It is a modern
five bed house that's on the market for £585,000. That Jane, is £65,000
under budget. I know it is no oil painting, but that can be improved
on and on the the inside it would need work to bring it up to to
Claire's standards. What are you playing at? This house
isn't a wreck. She is not going to be knocking walls around, but it is
a big modernisation job. There are five bedrooms here and plenty of
scope for updating, there is two bathrooms and an en suite that
needs finishing off. But the reason I'm excited is the land. There is
is two ache acres and there is a riding school with a ride on lawn
mower Imagine your house has its long
sweeping drive, gates up here to keep the children in, stop them
wandering off and you could put your cars in this wonderful,
courtyard space. It is not the prettiest of homes,
but... The point of a is a wreck it is to use your imagination to have
this vision. I'm thinking more wood on the front of the house. Wooden
doors on the garage to make it look softer, maybe even make it more
contemporary as well with a traditional feel.
I think it has potential. We could do something with the driveway.
There is a nice centrepiece that we could work with.
Not a bad start, but you will be needing bigger reactions.
Look at the size of this living room.
That is a genuine Ingle nook fireplace. I am not asking to you
knock down any walls. This is a refurbishment project. So what do
you think so far? The rooms are a brilliant size.
They work for me. Even Claire seems excited about the
potential. Just you wait until they see the potential outside.
We are moving away from the house now. Don't Worry because we are on
your land! We could still be on your land
right down in that bottom paddock. That's your boundary.
Wow. Really? Is that enough for a ride
on lawn mower. A good area for the kids to learn
and explore and learn about nature. You could have family rounders.
It is Claire who needs to be convinced. What is going through
your mind at the moment? Seeing the land made me emotional, I think. I
always take the children out for the day so they can run around and
play. I wouldn't have to leave the house to entertain them. Can I
reign you in for a little bit? I want to bring you down to earth
with a bump. There is a lot of work to do here. Have you thought about
the practicalities of doing all that work when you have got a young
family? Because there is nothing structural that needs doing to the
house, we could potentially get a lot of decorating done whilst we're
still in the rental. Bearing in mind your budget of
£650,000, this is on the market at £585,000 and on speaking to the
agent he reckons they should be looking to settle at £550,000.
£100,000 worth of deck kating, I think    decorating, I think you
could get that done! Claire never had a new kitchen.
Don't underestimate us, Johnny, it will take more than a central
island and a new dishwasher to win Claire over.
There is not a huge amount of work to do.
You are talking new kitchen, new bathroom, new windows.
If we get ourselves three months where we are now, whilst the bulk
of it is done and finishing touches after that if that would fit within
the budget. I'm not scared by it. We need to
add everything up. Jeff is interested, but I'm
thinking Claire needs persuading. Believe me, Johnny, my female
intuition tells me Claire is not digging it. It is time to shower
something she can get really excited about. Namely, my first
gorgeous ready. For that, we're going to the
village of Fairlight less than a mile from the sea.
It has got a church and pub and a small Post Office that also acts as
a village store. It is only ten minutes by car to Jeff's work in
Hastings and six minutes to the local primary school.
The property itself is a split level house which is for sale at
£595,000. It has got five bedrooms, a beautiful wrap around balcony, a
pool, a private two acre garden and knock out views. That maybe Jane,
but they don't like their current split level garden. What makes you
think they will go for a split level house? You know how Claire
likes her houses to have kerb appeal. I don't think this is what
she is after. Well, let's see, shall we? How is
this for a grand entrance. Wow.
Marvellous gates. What are your first thoughts? I love the drismt I
love the    drive. I love the gates. House. Is it a house or a bungalow?
I'm hoping it is split level. I imagine there is another storey the
other side. Bingo. Jeff has got it. No, Claire,
it is not a bungalow, Claire. It is a hidden gem, you will see.
You have a great living room with fantastic views. Is this working
for you? The first impression is fantastic. Yeah, I really like it.
I can't wait to get outside. Yef is Jeff is loving it.
Claire has gone silent. I need to get her out on to the
balcony so she can check out the space the twins can play in.
This is just shy of two acres. view is beautiful. It feels like I
am on holiday, but I am not sure about the house.
I love it! What's not working for you, Claire?
Probably my first impressions of the front of the house.
Listen, why don't you head in here because this is the views you will
be waking up to every morning. This is your master suite with the
dressing dressing room and en suite. Jane, you are not giving up without
a fight, are you? I know what I'm doing. The master suite is my
knockout punch! How can one room change my mind?
You are feeling it now, aren't you? I love the view from the bedroom.
I have got a good feeling now. Look at the size of that shower.
It feels like I am on holiday. Like a lovely holiday home.
You are right. You are You are really pulling out
all the stops on this one, Jane, but can you persuade Claire?
think she is being persuaded? has got everything I asked for, it
is just on a split level. This afternoon I am going to have to
nail it. I am going to have to show them something more traditional and
layout. Maybe something close to Hastings
where the kids have something to do and maybe give them something where
there is so much room in the budget that Claire won't have to lift a
finger. She is going to be on board by the end of the day. Let's go.
Let's get to work. Right, it is every woman...
every man. For themselves. Claire likes things
to be just so and I don't blame her. I won't rest until I found a home
that's just right. I will have my work cut out finding
something that appeals to Claire's desire for good aesthetics. One
thing is for sure, if Claire liked the holiday feel she got in Jane's
ready, she will like the location of my second wreck. Hastings is a
bustling seaside town with no no opportunity for the kids to pick up
their bucket and spade. It is down the road from where they
live. I reckon they might like it. They will love the price too. This
detached house, just five minutes drive from the town centre is
£255,000 under budget. It is far from being a total wreck, having
been partially renovated already. Jeff and Claire can take over the
reigns and transform it into the perfect home without too much
hassle. It has four good sized bedrooms, a big family bathroom
with a roll top bath and has the potential to extend upstairs.
Whilst there is a small garden, the main garden space on offer is to
the front of the house. More front than Hastings Prom nand,
Johnny. We will see who has the last laugh when they see it.
The garden, this is her, what do you think? I don't think it looks
like a wreck. The garden is at the front which
isn't ideal. Is that it? It lacks kerb appeal.
I'm thinking car parking and gates so nobody can see into your garden.
You have got your back guard an the front.
I have an issue with the garden being at the front. Can you imagine
sitting here barbecuing, the barbecue would be there. It doesn't
sound like Claire wants an audience when Claire is flipping her burgers.
I'm flipping worried! It's bigger than I thought.
Can you see past the neutral to sell decor? It is a bit foggy.
I can, but I don't know if I can be bothered to. If it was beautiful,
on an amazing road, my mind mind would start start thinking this is
a lovely place. At the moment... You are not seeing it, are you?
yet. That's the sound of hope.
But that's not a happy face. Who is having the last laugh now?
Look, I am not suggesting you keep this as it is. Come to the garden
and I will show you what I had in mind. The kitchen isn't nearly big
enough for the rest of the house. My thoughts were because we had a
lot left in the budget would be to bring it out this way, some form of
glass extension and you have got a long, dining kitchen so you can
keep an eye on everybody when you are doing the cooking and when the
kids are out here playing. There is no point in going down this road if
you are not saying, "Yeah, we like the area. We like parts of the
house." The house next door. You would almost offer to paint it for
them just to make your outlook nicer!
I can see it is not for you. If I was a betting man I would keep my
wallet in my pocket. This viewing has gone gone down the pan.
Perhaps they would feel feel better about this house if they knew how
flush they would be after the renovations. A new kitchen would
cost £30,000 and plus £8,000 to convert the loft into a bedroom. It
is a massive £215,000 under their bulght of £650,000, I am getting
the feeling I'm fighting a losing battle here.
I am thinking Harold would have something to say about that.
One in the eye for me. There is not a single redeeming
feature. There is not a single shower!
I can't imagine it. I really can't. No, it's not for me.
Whilst you scuttle off to lick your wounds, allow me to put this house
hunt back on track. Your first wreck may have not hit the nail on
the head, but they did like the location. It is clear Jeff and
Claire judge with their eyes and not their wallets.
I want to show them something they can fall in love with straightaway.
Something with great kerb appeal that Claire loves so much and maybe
a house with a more traditional layout might help. I have gone back
in Pett to find them that perfect village home minutes away from good
schools and Jeff's work. They don't come more traditional
than this five bedroomed Edwardian house which has a large level
garden and stunning sea and country views. It has been extented with
the addition of a two bed annex the space is so versatile they won't
need to lift a finger. But it comes at a price though.
Actually it is on the market for £625,000. Still within their budget
at £650,000. Eat your words Johnny. Well, I think I may have saved the
best until last. Claire, you wanted a great area with a good school,
which is what you are getting here, but you also requested from the get
go, you wanted kerb appeal. You wanted something that looked pretty
from the outside. Are you feeling it? This is it. This is it.
I need to get through the door. It is a wow.
Yeah, I love it from the outside. It says family, doesn't it?
Repeat after me Johnny, this is it. A quick tour downstairs.
Kitchen/diner, conservatory on to the garden. Is this a big enough
living room for you? Yes. Yes, absolutely.
I almost like it so much I'm not looking properly. It has got a
lovely feel. It has connected with you on so many levels.
You are getting a separate annex which is here built on to the
property. It is two up, two down with the kitchen and everything in
that. It is a separate home essentially. Is this somewhere you
could feel like you could lay down your roots and stop forever? So far,
it feels like my dream, dream home. Yeah.
And you too? To get that reaction from Claire is fantastic. It is
what we have been looking for. You can't help it when you have
been looking for a couple of years and you walk into a place that just
feels right and you don't... can't afford this, can we? Well, I
have got to be honest with you, it is coming in quite close to your
budget at £625,000. Really? welling up now. I imagine admitting
such a disastrous defeat is upsetting, you might want to grab a
tissue because I think the best is yet to come. We are going to head
straight out into the garden because the garden has a view to
die for. Cool.
Wow. Sea views. Can you imagine sitting out here in
the morning on your decking? Yeah. Having breakfast with views like
that? I just love it. And very private.
My work here is almost done. If they can see the potential of the
attached annex I think I might have just cracked it.
Wow. My goodness.
It is a miniature perfect home, isn't it? If friends came, it would
be like a little holiday place for them. Finally, it is upstairs to
the to the bedrooms. Did you ever think you would be
lucky to have a house like this, seriously?
And there is no reason why they couldn't live in a house like this,
but it wasn't an easy road getting here, was it Johnny? No, we have
been searching all day to show Jeff and Claire the best properties
available so they can get out of rented and into a fab family home
close to good schools and with a big enough garden for the twins.
They loved the amount of land that came with my first wreck, but
Claire wasn't inspired of the prospect a complete overhaul.
Claire thought my first ready looked like a bungalow. It had a
pool and fantastic views from a gorgeous master suite.
My final wreck was a write off. I don't think Claire could get a
garden out the front out of the back of her mind.
No wonder they got so emotional in my final ready. Who could blame
them? It was a fantastic looking house in a great area with the
bonus of an annex. It sounds to me it is two against
one, will they go for my first wreck? Or my ready?
It beats my last place. I had views of a hedge!
She was almost in tears. I hear we have had waterworks.
Almost. Was it you, Jeff? Yes, it was.
Let's give awe chance to dry your eyes, shall we? The first house,
what do you think? It was the two acres of land that appealed to me.
It sounds like you are thinking fairly positively.
Speaking positively. It would have started as a project
and still been a project in ten years.
Then I decide to take you to something with kerb appeal and with
the same amount of land. Now your heart wasn't in that when you
started the property. The gates were fantastic. It seemed
grand, but more like a bungalow at first. But then I had a turn around
when I saw the garden. And the master bedroom suite. With
those doors opening up to that wonderful view.
You were on side at the start of that even though it was a ready. If
you have come round to it that sounds like a possibility.
Absolutely. We left there, clearly I went wrong.
Just so we know, when did you write that place off? When we arrived.
Walking up the garden. I brought you here. What are your
thoughts now? I still love the place. You are not sure now we have
seen the upstairs. I felt claustrophobic. Is it a balance
between heart versus head with the houses we have seen? Absolutely.
Maybe you should sleep on it tonight and get back to us on which
one you want to view again. It is all about my two readies, one
doesn't have the wow factor, but has the space their family needs
and the other has won them over on style, but it is short on space.
After a night to sleep with it, they call me and Jane with their
decision. We both fell in the love with house
number four particularly Claire as you know, but we we felt the
dimensions inside weren't suitable for us. We would like to go back
and see house number two, the one with the pool.
You liked it? It was a case head over heart really.
Let me know how you get on. We will.
past that bungalow feeling she gets from the front.
This is when I changed my mind about the property when I saw that
view. Gorgeous.
It is looking positive, Jane. what's the final verdict? Now I
have been to the bottom of the garden, I like it even more. If I'm
really honest with you Jeff, perhaps I still don't feel it in
the house, but as soon as I step out here, I just can imagine the
twins playing here. I was just about to say the the
same thing. For them to grow up with this, they would be more
rounded children. I think it is a home to be proud of,
but it is not from the front certainly, it hasn't got the...
Kerb appeal. The wow factor.
I I didn't sleep very well last night.
I think we need to have a really good good think about it.
Well, Claire never seemed totally convinced my my first ready and
they decided to go for a ready home they managed to find a few days in
Battle right at the top of their budget.
