Good morning it's time to get the stomachs rumbling, this is Saturday
Kitchen Live. Welcome to the show, cooking with me in the studio are
two of the country's finest chefs, first first from the depths of
Devon, and Elephant restaurant, Simon Hulstnoe, and from his two 
star mission Lens re fraunts the Gleneagles hotel, it is fairly
fairly fairly. What's on the menu for you? Grey
mullet, sustainable fish from Brixham, I'm going to do with clam,
tomatoes and spring onion and an orange and basil sauce. Cucumber
hearts and wild herbs. A light dish, I presume you're going stronger
than that from the Scottish roots. A roasted squab with spices,
confeet the leg, roast the breasts, some kale and wild mushrooms, some
ceps. We have Rick Stein and the Great British Menu, and Keith Floyd.
Spooks. Congratulations you have been
performing to people all yr life. But this is the one that has
brought to the masses. Spooks is such a flagship show for the BBC it
was a gift to come and join the team. We saw you on Robin Hood as
well? Sword fighting and as youing chaos. But this is something
different for you? Yeah, yeah, it is obviously spy work, which is
kind of fascinating, the more you find out, the more you get involved,
the more you go, God this is on a level that even I couldn't
comprehend at times, what they have to deal with. You are here to eat.
Our cooked food heaven and hell for you, heaven your favourite
ingrodent or nightmare ingredient food hell. So food heaven, if you
could pick anything? I'm a big fish eater, I'm looking forward to the
mullet. I love fish, Scottish salmon. You had to say Scottish
salmon! Keep them both happy. I'm cooking it. Green, kale, green
beans, spinach. You are almost getting through the menu. The zesty
orange sounds good. The dreaded food hell? I'm really not a fan of
bananas, that is unusual, but the smell and the texture and the
stringiness, it feels all wrong to me. There you go, salmon or banana
for heaven or hell. I have a pan fried salmon with coconut and mint
salad, there is some beans, it is served simply with a green bean
salad, slices of coke cut, a mint coriander and a spicy chilli jam.
Who do I have to bribe for that one. I have ban nan and cuss standard
start,   banana and custard tart. Ban nans on the bottom of a custard
start, and then a dollop of clotted cream. That is a heart take on the
plate. You don't watch this show! You have to wait until the end of
the show to see which one it is. We have our Saturday Kitchen viewers,
who got with you? My daughter Georgina. You have four choices?
I'm the favourite. You are the only daughter. Has some of your
experience in cooking, you are a serious cook, has that rubbed on to
your daughter? Hopefully not, I'm not the best. I actually, it is as
quick as I could be, and it is really just what they want to eat.
They are not put off food for the rest of their lives. Including
frozen pizza in the microwave? grew up thinking I didn't like
pizza, I thought that is how it tasted, soggy on the outside and
frozen in the middle. I have done her a favour. You are here to learn
and ask as many questions as you like to the guys, you get to decide
what Lara will be eating at the end of the show. If you want to ask
I will be asking you whether you want food heaven or help. Cooking
first is man who is lowly becoming more famous in the home town of
Torquay than Basil Fawlty, for all the right reasons. Great to have
you back in the show, on the menu is grey mullet. Flat head mullet,
grey mullet, silver mullet, whatever you want to call it. It is
great alternative and they go up 2  3 kgs. I will do tomato hearts,
3 kgs. I will do tomato hearts, cucumber, orange and basil dressing.
You are going to give me that to do. I'm going to cut the spring onions.
I learned something new today, Torquay, the English Riviera.
have palm trees. There is two people who didn't know that. It is
lovely down there. It is not like Nice, but it is nice enough for me!
It is a good job you are a cooking. I have the lovely side of the
tomato seeds, they are usually wasted, but they pop in your mouth
in the dressing and it is lovely Tell us about the restaurant. It is
split into two? The Phantom Menace itself, we have a bround floor  
the Elephant is split in two, we have a first floor brasserie,
sustainability is a big thing, on the first floor there is the fine
dining restaurant, the room, which we have a mission Len star for, and
hopefully still will in a couple of weeks. Do you want this trimming up.
Can you just take the skin properly off there, it is my name on the
dish chef. Nice steaming pan, little bit of
olive oil, skin side down. Lovely. Do you use much grey mullet in
Scotland? Sea bass!'S Two star. It is a cheap alternative. You do use
it? We use it on the menu. What have you done with the tomatoes.
Deseeded them, and kept the seeds back. And I have these cucumber
hearts, I will use an apple corer, using the seeds rather than the
flesh itself. What took you down to the river era   rifer? My dad's
from down there, so I went back down, it has everything for us,
just a bit too far away from London. I'm draining the spring onions, I
will grill these off in the gridle pan. Just to get a little bit of
colour. To be honest, you have your own little microclimate down there?
It is, we're surrounded by Dartmoor, so a lot of the heat we lose,
Dartmoor gets all the snow and wind, when it gets to us it's all chilled
down really, it is quite nice. is nice, I fly over it a bit.
you, is it? It is me, buzzing around. I thought it was. I could
smell the aftershave. Thank you very much.
Call the number if you want to ask a question.
Sam has his last recipe on Saturday Kitchen! That will be on the
website. Are you putting the liquid in there.
White wine going in there, I will cover that with mother plan to let
it steam through. I will put my onions in there with them. Just the
hearts again. Once my clams are cooked I'm going
to use a little bit of a juice to make the dressing. Would this be in
the restaurant or the brasserie? The brasserie. We use a local farm
and we get all our nice vegtables in season from them. These are the
sort of things that we have all the time on the menu. A lot of people
panic when they are cooking this and keep turning it over? Just once.
And I will let it get cooked on the one side, put more oil in and let
the residual heat of the pan cook through that. The fish carries on
cooking all the time. It is all about timing, really. So the next
thing is I will make a dressing. All the dressing is the orange
juice, and reducing that down. It is going to have a little white
wine in there. It is short on there. A little bit of sugar. Depending on
what your oranges are like, if they are too sour. All I'm going to do
is put olville oil in. The clams are cooked, can you take them out
of the shell. I will take a little of the clam juice there. Take them
out of the shell? Lovely. You have a lovely stock there which you can
use it. I prefer mussel stock to clam, it has a cleaner flavour to
it. Pouring some olive oil on to that. You got these little bits of
shallots? They will go through there as well. Nicely cooked. All I
need then is a little bit of basil to finish the dressing. We have got
a Riviera down south, is there one in Scotland? We just have a big
playground? You do, fantastic up there. Have you never been to
Inverness, it is stunning. Have you ever been to Inverness. I have, I
flew over it with James! We have our clams. We're just going to
dress the plate. These are red spring onions, slightly different.
They do lose a little colour when cooked. Same sort of flavour.
will put the clams in now. Bit of olive oil in there. Clams in there,
I will put the oranges around the plate. Drop the basil in there.
fish is ready for you. Spoon's on there. I strust you! Trust me!, as
you threw it on the plate. These have just been warmed up, the
cucumber has a lovely flavour when hot. You just use the centre and
the seed part? We would use the rest of it in the restaurant for
different things, for this dish for just that. I will put the clams
around the outside and then add all these nice colours as well. We have
the lovely base is the seeds of the tomato. All those nice little bits
and flavours. It is so nice to use these, a lot of people would throw
them away? Throw them in the stock. We have the heritage tomatoes, it
is more of a warm salad, there is the warm dress, the clams around
there, and the oranges. It is a Riviera style dish. Talking Riviera,
you have what looks like a harvest festival now. We have lovely rocket
flowers, they add pepper and colour and love to it. These are flors
from the broccoli. We have the borage, which has cucumber flavour.
That is great. It is wood sorel, a nice sour sort of crab apple
flavour. Remind us gain? Grey mullet, orange basil dressing with
cucumber hearts. There you go, that is the first one.
Can I TUC in. Yes, first time you have   Tuck in. Yes, the first you
have had grey mullet for breakfast! It is used a lot in Indian cooking,
not as much here? People are scared of a name, people go for the red
mullet, people use the silver mullet and flat head. The zest of
the orange is really great with it too. I'm going to pass it down.
Otherwise it won't go any further. It all works really well, all the
flavours the cucumber, the orange, the basil and tomatoes. We need
wine to go with this. We went to the West Country. What was chosen
I'm on the decks of the kingdom of Brunel's magnificent SS Great
Britain in Bristol, I'm heading off into the city to find magnificent
wine would to equal the dishes. Simon's mullet is a brilliantly
original and skillfully assembled dish, full the bright but subtle
flavours, the challenge is to find a wine that compliments the
stronger flavours, like the orange, without overwhelming the delicate
ones, like the mullet. We need a white wine. One grape variety that
combines the exotic with subtley is the Handpicked Viognier. You could
go for a scented fresher style like this one. I have chosen The Bernard
Series Viognier. Some white lines like Sauvignon Blanc are about
tangy and freshness, but Viognier is different, it is more mouth 
coating than mouth water, sometimes it means it is too much for food,
you have to choose it with care, like this one.
Because, yes, it is scented and succulent, which will work really
well with the orange and fruit in the dish, it is also balanced and
fresh, which is what we need for the cucumber, the tomatoes and the
basil. Finally it is just delicate, and not domineering in any way, the
gentle delicacy of the mullet and the clams won't be overwhelmed.
Simon here is a beautifully scented and subtle way   wine for this dish.
It is going down a treat there, it is not coming back. We are not
getting any, what do you reckon to the wine to go with it? It is bang
on, nail on the head with this one, works perfectly. A lot of the wines
are not particularly matched with food, but this is good for on its
own. A really good aftertaste. haven't tasted any of it yet, I'm
assuming you like it girls? Really nice. Delicious. What do you
reckon? Fantastic, summer on plate. And a great wine to go with it.
Join us here at the chef's table some time in the series, all you
have to do is write to us with your Later on Andrew has a glorious game
recipe to show us, remind us what it is? Roasted breast of squab with
confeit leg, some curly kale, and some Scottish wild mushrooms.
Scotland on plate. Let's head to India for the seafood odyssey with
Mr Rick Stein. He starts off in a busy fish market. For once you will
be glad there is no such thing as   smelly vision!
I love going out and searching for all the great dishes around the
world, I like to go to harbours and markets, it is a bit like the
search for the Holy Grail, or the seafood Holy Grail, if you like.
Cooks should be a bit like magpies, travelling the world and picking up
things they really love and cherish, like this prawn caldene. What I'm
looking for are local dishes without finesse, but full of
honesty and freshness, that come from places that haven't been
messed about with, so the food remains as unspoilt as they are.
I have been here about three or four times to Goa, and I have been
with Jill, my wife and my three boys, the first time we came the
boys were frankly shocked by all of this. Particularly this fish market,
which us just smells a bit tough, really. I was thinking of a way of
trying to make it easy for them, I remember this film we really liked,
Monty Python and the Holy Grail, there is a scene in the medieval
village of extreme squalor, but also lots of colour, where there is
a cart going through "bring out the dead", I was reminding them of it
and it was a joke. It worked, they began to see what it is all about.
It is about real life. In the west we sort of, I think, slightly don't
want to know about the unpleasant scenes that you see here. And we
hide it all. But here, you see everything. You see terrible
begging scenes and terrible squalor, but you also see this exotic colour
and smells, and the bishop here are just dead fresh. The only smell
here is of fresh fish, actually. But it is a hit hot. I just sort of
think, this is what you really want. This is what cooks really want. We
want supermarkets, we want markets like this, nature, warts and all.
Wouldn't it be great if we could just buy a whole shark, like this
blue fin shark, perfect for my next dish.
This is shark vind will you, this ain't the sort of   the most
important thing in a vindaloo is the paste, and the most important
inveedent in the vindaloo paste is the onion, which we roasted in the
tandoori oven this morning. Straight into the mortar, sugar,
not a lot because of the onions got most of the sugar, then cumin
seasoning, about a teaspoon, and cloves, about a teaspoon. It is not
measuring exactly, I sort of know, I don't measure my life in coach
fee spoons.   coffee spoons! Tam Mir rain, and cinnamon   tam Mir
ran, and cinnamon steps. These are dried red chillis and gives a deep
red colour, I have soaked these and put them into the mortar. And
grated ginger, making it easier to grind in the mortar, finally a good
chalk of glarlic. The glarlic in geo  the garlic is really fiery in
Goa, it is pungent, quite unlike the ones in Europe. I love the
mortar and pestle. You hammer down the pestle to get everything
chopped up finely, then you start a grinding motion. Of course you have
spice grinders at home, but one of the things the Indians say, that
when you grind spice slowly, you get better flavour out of it
because it doesn't overheat as it does in a high speed grinder. And
though I have a mortar and pestle at home, I use the spice grinder
sometimes. On a perfect Indian day it is real therapy. It is a bit
course, but I like it like that. I used to think there was tomato
puree in pastes like this, but it is all the colour of the wonderful
spices. Now to start the finished dish, in there goes a couple of
handfuls of red onions. We need to brown those off really well, the
thing about the vindaloo is it is a dark, brown, reddy colour. It is
the silly thing about the cooking, is onions need to be nice and brown,
you never get the taerst otherwise, it is one of those cases where you
don't soften onions and throw something else, it is where you get
the lovely burnt onion flavour. Then the tomatoes go in and it
cooks down to a paste. Now for the vindaloo paste, in it goes, all of
it. That looks good, stir it into the tomato and onion. Look at that.
Really rich, deep red colour. Just right for some shark. We need a bit
of water just to let it down a bit to add the fish, about half a pint
of natural mineral water in Goa. That is just about right. Now we're
ready for the fish. OK, so here we ready for the fish. OK, so here we
have the shark. Lovely pieces of blue shark, you get spark very
easily in supermarkets back home these days, and fishmongers, you
could use sward fish, tuna or monkfish for this dish. Actually,
if you don't like fish, you could also use pork, I shouldn't say
this! I have four chillis which I have seeded, I pop those in and
cook the fish for ten minutes. The final thing is some vinegar, this
is always a vinegary sauce, not he cansively, but just gives it a
little freshness at the end. I will try that now with a bit of
fish. I have a' done it, I think I have,
  I've done it, I think, but David the director, I said please don't
ask me to offer it up to locals, it is so embarrassing, everybody seems
to do it on tele, they will say, yes, very nice. But actually, it
really is good. I think they would be pleased with that.
Rick's series about great local dishes. We have a wealth of them in
the UK. I have been to Ireland this week, and you can't travel to the
emerald aisle without this stuff. That famous Irish stout, because we
work for the BBC we can't pronounce what it is (Guinness)! I can only
do it once, that goes in the pan, with chicken. We will pot roast the
chicken. Hot pan on the stove, we will get is nice and hot. Brown off
the chicken, this is a perfect dish for tomorrow. A whole chicken, in.
We are going to colour that, just slightly. We are going to pot roast
this at the same time. Some of the stout, stock, a little onion, I
will make a as you out of cabbage and potatoes. Ireland potatoes,
potatoes and more poet it atoes. potatoes. Where were you in
Ireland? BallyClaire. The weather changes like you wouldn't believe
it, one minute it is this and that. Great hospitality. Not about me,
this is about you. Spooks conglat gratlaigss on the new series  
congratulations on the new series. This is the last series? Yes, it
will be the last series of Spooks. We are going out with a bang. And
the writers and cast have put together a really good final six 
episode arc. Tonight we see the possible tragedy of one of our
beloved spies, and you know, typical Spooks fashion, a lot
happens to put us all at risk, really. This is tomorrow night?
Sunday night, 9.00pm. We are going to chop it up, something different
for you, because looking back at your career, I mean, theatre is a
huge important part of your life, particularly when you were younger?
When I first graduated from drama school I got into theatre and was
fortunate enough to kin of   kind of keep getting job after job and
job, it was aamazing at the time. I would go back and do for the right
project. Working at place like The Donmar Warehouse have been
extremely influential in my career and me meeting some great people,
working with great creative teams and directors and cast. It was the
National Youth Theatre? Music theatre. That is sponsored by Lloyd
Webber? It was, and Prince Edward and the Prince's Trust also, there
was such a wealth of talent in that youth theatre. The year I was
involved, the few years I was involved we had people like sherd
Dan Smith, and Tom Chm betters..   Sheridan Smith and Tom Khamenei.
Tom Chambers. Put it in the oven there, I poured
the stout in there and it reduces down with the glaze. My brother in 
law is a really good cook he will expect me to do something along
these lines and I will take notes. We have had several actors and
actresses and they have goth gone straight into television. But the
theatre must be great grounding for TV work? Absolutely, whichever way
you do it. I just love being a part of live theatre, that collaborative
process, and the rehearsal process you get to go through. But TV
brings a complete low different, it is a completely different way of
working. Is it because you can make them make the character your own on
theatre? You literally, for two  and a half hours or however long
your piece is, you roughly have control of your journey, your
character's journey, even though you have obviously had a rehearsal
period, and it is collaborative, for what you do in the two hours
you are in control of it. If you shoot a TV show, and it is not live
like this, you give of your scene in many different ways, and then
you kind of have to let it go, it is in the hands of the editor,
director and the producers, you have to make peace with it and give
it into their hands, and the finished project is the director's
project. They sit there and having a bacon sarnie the producers, he
spends half the day tweeting and going on Myface, or whatever it is?
A collaboration of Facebook and MySpace, I like that. I stupidly
breakdanced last week, it is all over YouTube. Now I need to get you
to sing at some point today. not making that mistake again, they
were all tweeting, or whatever. MyFace. As well as Spooks, we have
seen you in True Blood, this vampire thing? It is an amazing
cult television how sho that HBO creates that has become an
international phenomenon. At the head is Alan Ball, an international
writer and produce he, who created pieces like Six Feet Under and
American Beauty, that film. It was thrilling to go and join such
massive TV show, I joined for the series three, and series four,
which series three is currently airing on Channel 4 right now. So I
kind of amon every channel. Everything at the moment. Is that
normal, does everything come at once? I think, it is like buses
some days. Some days you can't get arrested for a job, other days
momentum just takes over, and you just enjoy that time, and you know,
I feel very grateful that the opportunities that I have had this
year. It has been really exciting. They are all different characters.
Is that the G word you have put in there that I can't say. Don't worry
you find it on "tinter net" as my mother calls it.
When you pot roast it you end up with a lovely gravy, you leave it
to rest. Garlic with the potatoes and create a little broth with it.
With some butter, which you have to use. You have to! James Martin's
secret ingredient. Not on this show, believe me. We will chop this up
nicely as well. What herb is that, sorry? That is
parsley. We mentioned True Blood and then Sheryl lock? Yes. In
January. With the great Benedict Cumberbatch. Series two will air
with the wonderful Benedict come better match and Martin Freeman.
Series one was incredible, I saw it when I was working in the states,
it was one of the best things I have seen on TV for a long time.
seems you get all the proper jobs in all the big shows? Knock on wood.
There is obviously more to come, which is very exciting. But yeah,
it is great. Stephen Moffat is a huge part of Doctor Who and has
written the episode I'm doing on Sheryl lock, he's an incredible
writer What about theatre? When the right project comes along, whatever
the medium, when you read something and know you want to do it, then I
like the variety of doing gak and forth. And going back and forth  
back and forth and between here and America, it is so exciting.
smells so good? You get a piece of chicken with it.
I'm so impressed that your shirt is potlessly clean. My shirt is not
the problem, it is my jeans! That's his third shirt this morning.
have four shirts like this. We slice that through, you have a
little piece of chicken with it. It is like a brothy sort of thing,
dive in and tell us what you think. I feel extraordinarily grateful to
come here. It is perfect comfort food. It feels like it has become
autumnal, although we are due for a heatwave I think. I think so. You
should cook this, watch Spooks, you want to watch Spooks, not that
programme on the other side. Spooks has guns and Lara in it, proper
stuff. They are not chucking stones at each like ITV. That gravy is
really nice. Food heaven, pan fried salmon with
an Asian style salad, green beans, coconut, coriander, and finished
off with a thigh spiced chilli ja. Or banana and   Thai spiced chilli
jam. Or banana tart with custard, dusted saud it aed bananas with
clotted   sauted bananas with clotted cream. What do you think
Simon? I would like the bananas! Vicky what about you? It is the
clotted cream did it. You have to wait until the end of the show to
see the final result. We have reached the Scottish heat of the
Great British Menu, Tony Singh and Michael Smith battle it out for
place in the final. Michael's menu kicks off with
simple baked cheese, a fondu dish with cracker breads for dipping. It
is Tony setting things in motion. Deep fried rabbit in a hat, he
hopes it will get people talking. It is cheese on toast, will the
judges like that against a rabbit in a hat, a bit more risky,
hopefully I will nudge ahead at the beginning. Tony's menu relies
heavily on props, a strategy that will make or break him, Michael is
quick to sow the seeds there. that rabbit coming from the
madhatter. He can't afford to overor undercook his spicy crumbed
rabbit, which has to be deep fried at the last minute. Are you on time
or a couple of minutes late. I will be fine, I will get there. Right on
the edge with the rabbit. By my watch I have another three minutes.
How long has your rabbit got? Ignoring Michael's attempts to
derail him, Tony serves up his Asian slau, made with pea nuts and
a chill cli kick, fills his hat with crisp   chilli kick, fills his
hat with crispy rabbits and gets it to the table without a moment to
spare. You know what, I think the best looking thing in this little
collection is the finger bowls, perhaps it tasted better than it
looks. I must say I have to say this is
really delicious. I do think if you are going to do this sort of thing
don't leave bones in there. There is quite a lot of spicing going on
there, which is also disguising any sort of delicate flavour that is
going on. That's the trouble, the dressing on both of these things is
just too powerful. Top hat, but not top hole.
Mixed reviews for Tony's rabbit, will Michael's simple baked cheese
get him off to a better start it's serving it with a tomato chutney,
grape jelly and crisp breads. When it comes to Brentation, Tony thinks
his is streets ahead. You have gone for the Huaugh! As good as the hat?
You think it can be improved Yes. If that is your interpretation.
is a direct hit from tone year, but Michael thinks he's on to a winner,
as he sends the baked cheese. Smell the cheese.
OK, put it down in front of Prue please, in the centre of the table,
please. I don't know what to say? I think
it looks good. Shall I be mum, this is cheese baked in a crust. You dig
in like that. It is a fondue, isn't the fondue the absolute classic
party thing, let's all get together v a lovely time. One trusts it is
Scottish cheese. I'm sure it is. think the cheese is not
particularly good quality. I think it is OK, I expect, if you are
going to go to the bother of having centre piece cheese, it needs more
character. My only complaint about it, it is an easily fixed one, is
this is a little bit too much hard work. Exactly.
Some praise, but hardly full marks for Michael. Will the fish course
produce a clear front runner. Tony's roasted Laing goes teens
with chilli jam are up first.   langoustines with chilli jam are up
first. His presentation is great, if the judges go there, the prawns
are delicious, I'm not sure if it covers all the basics. Tony thinks
his ingredients are good enough to do the talking and particulars all
the boxes for today's brief. Will the judges agree. Gentleman nice
and wide, strong shoulders, you have no problem.
What is this? Fingers before forks. I think it is very practical,
people could take them away and adds to the conviviality. It is
good to see a seafood platter. is good, look, absolutely perfectly
cooked too. You know what, this chilli jam, that's plastered over
the top is absolutely delicious. Really delicious. I can't think of
anything wrong with it. I think you're supposed to have it on bread,
but we are eating it without. bread is completely unnecessary.
This is one of the first dishes you get a sense of Scottishness and a
sense of occasion. I can't see any reason whatever why this shouldn't
be a dish for the banquet, it has everything. It looks great, it is
my favourite food, and it is a talking point. Does everything for
me lovely. As a proper celebration, a sense of drama to it, good.
Well, it's a big thumbs up for Tony's langoustine, will Michael's
fish course measure up. He has elevated classic kegry to a dish
worthy of the quit. Tony thinks he has missed the mark. When I think
of kedgeree I think breakfast. Michael still thinks he has the
edge. He's serving it paella style, and serving three types of cured
salmon, vibrant eggs, salmon skin crisp, and Chevy holidays foam,
will the judges agree with Tony. Wow. Well. What is it? I think it
is kedgeree. You are right. Fish, eggs, that looks suspiciously like
salmon skin erupting. A huge delicacy in Japan.
It doesn't smell of curry? I want curry in my kedgeree. I think it is
absolutely perfectly cooked, it is a really beautiful delicate dish.
Is it a banquet dish, kedgeree is either breakfast or supper, it is
not exciting enough or dramatic enough for the banquet. The main
problem is it is not the langoustine. It is almost like a
brunch dish. It is homely, comfortable, warm, nice, it is
something I get in my home. I think dam fine piece of cook, stop it you
snobs! You can see if everybody stopsic
aboutering to decide on a winner   stopsic aboutering to decide on a
winner. We still have Keith Floyd to come,
cooking dinner for a French family. Stuffed artichokes, classic stuff.
Neither Simon or Andrew eggs elled themselves last time they did the
omelettes, will they be able to beat their previous attempts and
scramble to the top ten! See them in the omelette challenge. That is
what our producer does do for the rest of the week. What will I cook
for Lara at the end of the show, heaven or hell.
Salmon or banana. Andrew what do you like the sound of, bananas or
the salmon? Fighting chance,ly go for the salmon. Thank you Andrew.
Correct answer. Cooking next is one of the Scotland's finest chefs and
the holder of two mission Len stars for his restaurant inside the
luxurious Gleneagles Hotel, it is Andrew Fairlie. The squab is a game
bird is it? This one is farmed it is much more tender and full of
flavour. You want to take the crown off? I will remove the wish bone,
taking the wish bone out of poultry if you carve it, makes it easier.
will toast off the spices, which are? Cinnamon, cloves, coriander
and some four spice in there as well. I just want to brown the skin
on the breast. Once James is done, just season that, inside and out.
While's doing that. Carry on! I will drop those using for the sauce.
Come on! Which have a spare one here. That is the ground spice over
there like that. Straight in the oven.
Next. It is in now. This is James breakdance moves from last week!
Carry on, otherwise I will leave you to it. Please don't do that. It
is classic confit of duck what we'll do with it. Juniper berry as
well. You would normally confit the legs to get it really tender?
we are going to crisp them up in the pan at the very end. What we
are going to have is a contrast between the breast, nice and pink,
and then the confit leg once it is maranaiding. You guys have
something in common, you and Simon, you are both roux scolars? That's
right. What does that mean? I was the first one, Simon was? 2003 Andy
is it a granddady? Not that you would know looking like us.
pink shirt makes you look younger. I'm judging on it now. It is the
ultimate competition? When you look at some of the chef that is come
through the scholarship, some of the best chefs in the country are
coming through. The competition is probably harder now when I started.
The quality is certainly better. lot hard. Since Simon and I won it!
It deslaunch a chef's career and you get   it does launch a chef's
career and you get work experience in any restaurant you want?
three star Michelin restaurant. When Simon and I won it, it was in
France. It was Europe. I got the cheaper version, I got France.
Confit the legs, duck fat in there, we will warm that. And I have some
With duck it is 24 hours, but these? An hour is plenty. The flesh
has already firmed up. It has taken on the seasoning from the garlic,
the juniper, the bay leaf. Then we are just going to pop them into the
fat, and we will have them slowly cooking away there. Has the kale
gone in? Probably for about an hour. This is the green kale. The bones.
What we will do is make that with some port, going to flame that.
you are just showing off with fireworks and everything else!
were just gently cooking in fat, you don't boil it? Keep it around
about 80 degrees, that is perfect, leave them there for an hour. You
can preserve them. We have some we did earlier this morning.
I would say that is the duck fat set, I will put them skin side down,
you can keep them in the fat generally for a couple of weeks or
six months if you want. Tell us about Gleneagles, I visited
there for the first time earlier this year, I actually just thought
it was a hotel with a golf club. It is a complex, it is everything?
is a huge resort. People think Gleneagles hotel is a little
country house hotel in the north of Scotland, but it is massive. We
have the Ryder Cup coming in 2014, which is a huge event. Everything,
the mountain biking, falconry, one of the best bars in the UK. What
I'm going to do here is I have some ceps. Soma of the best wild
mushrooms in the country   we have some of the best wild mushrooms in
the country. I will have some here hedgehog mushrooms, these all grow
around the golf course, and I have cleaned them up. They have little
hairs in the bottom that I have scraped off. They are a little bit
bitter, clean them off. Why don't they call them sheep's foot, that
is a direct translation of the French? I don't know, maybe they
look like sheep's feet, I don't know. It is a good enough reason to
that name. Someone will write in and correct me. They just want
colouring. So the skin is nice and crispy. The little squab, would you
cook all game like that the way you are cooking this pigeon? Yeah, you
can do. With game birds as well, what people tend to do is get rid
of the legs because they are sinewy, because there is not much fat in
them, I like to cook them in like that, I love the texture of a
confit leg. Sauce happening here. I will go check, it has had 5.5
minutes? Another 30 seconds. Go to the website for the recipes.
I'm going to take the sauce and pass it through there and reduce it
down for you. The ceps and the hedgehog mushrooms
will be cooked down. The blanched quail that you did, I'm going to
mix that together. Let me have a look at the squab.
I will take that one out of the oven for you. There you go.
That's fine. Let me just take it off and rest it.
Again with most girls leave it to rest so we don't lose too much
juice. You see that's ceps and the mushroom starting to roast there.
That will have a beautiful nuty flavour. The kale have cooked.
Put some kale into there, with the mushrooms, I'm like you, a little
bit of butter. Bit more! Bit more, exactly, you see. That's the way to
do it! Give that a minute while that sauce reduces. Right we are
ready. Get rid of this. Let's go.
The sauce is ready. Get that on the plate for you.
OK, so I'm just going to take this mushroom now. I'm just going to cut
down the centre bone there, you can see taking the wish bone out, it is
much easier to carve the bird. Another minute in the oven would
have been perfect. I'll just give that another go.
Just going to take that off. I will look after that while you played up.
Let me take the wing bone off. You want some of this powder.
Season it a little bit with some more spice.
Just about ready for you. There is the crispy legs, spiced breasts.
And the sauce is done. It's all seasoned and ready. There
is the port sauce. Of course, game is such a predominant part of your
menu, but especially Scottish menus now, as it comes into season?
are properly getting into the season, roast grouse, wild duck.
Here we have the roast squab, with spices, confit leg, wild mushrooms
and curly kale. I told you he's a genius.
I have to say it looks fantastic, and I know it takes fantastic,
because I had it for breakfast this morning.
Dive into that. I don't know if you start, really. Where do you suggest.
The �20 worth of mushrooms or whatever? Now I know what you do at
golf courses, go around picking mushrooms. It tastes delicious. All
game, particularly feathered game, confit the legs a great way of
doing it. Roast the breast and the spice at the end gives it an
autumnal seasoning to it. Let's go to Bristol to see what Andrew has
Andrew's squab is an out number national blockbuster with an all
star cast of ingredients, meaty and full flavoured. We are definitely
in red wine territory. It is really important that the red isn't too
heavy and refreshs the palate between mouthfuls, or it might get
a bit too much. Two great grape varieties that work really with
autumnal flavours are Pinot Noir, this lovely extra Special One from
New Zealand. I have found something a little bit different, not only
does it work brilliantly well, it is also amazing value for money. It
is the wonderful Mayu Sangiovese from chel Chile. It is the classic
grape variety of the can I anti  region in Italy. It doesn't make  
Chianti region in Italy. It goes with real food, it has the wildness
and rustic, it is working really well with the game and the ceps in
the dish, it is a fresh lifted style, we need that to cut through
the richness of the confit meat and the pork, and pick up on the tangy
jun pup berries, finally there is a lovely herbal quality that will
work with the thyme and the bay and the coriander. Andrew it is a
seasonal triumph of the dish, here is a great value, autumnal red to
go with it. Is it, we know it is great value? It is perfect,
actually. Not too much tanin, great acidity to it, great with the spice.
I actually cannot believe this is a fiver. I can't believe it. It is a
really nice red, I promise I didn't eat a   all of that, did I pass it
down. What do you reckon? Lovely. You have tried a bit of that?
Wonderful, the ceps worked perfectly. A great dish. I get the
feeling they will sell out this quickly. We go back to Scotland to
see the Scottish heat of the Great British Menu, the judges are still
bickering. Let's see who makes it to the final.
Time for their main courses. Michael's bash kued lamb with
potato wedges and slaw is up first. With the clock particulars he
plates it up. Summer slaw and baked potato wedges, and loads his five
different cuts on to his smoldering indoor barbecue.
It's a barbecue. It is still going. It is wonderful, it is the best
dish we have seen. They are cooked, look. Can he do that for 100.
lamb is delicious. This is very exciting. It is great fun, that is
really what it is, it is what we are looking for. A bit of fun, a
bit of interaction, a bit of a talking point. It is a joyous
experience, I think all good things. Michael's barbecue has gone down a
storm, will Tony's main course be as big a hit it's taking a huge
risk, dishing up seven of his childhood favourites in tiffin 
style boxes, including spicy salmon, and chickpea curry, and a
controversial recipe using baked beans. It is something unheard of
in the great British kitchen, one that might cost him a place in the
finals. Still going with the baked beans? Yes.
Confident he's providing something for everyone, gets his
controversial beans into one of many tiffin tins, with his mutton
and potato stew, and honey roast pork belly, and finally delivers
them to the pass. Gents, sharing, it is tiffin.
It's tiffin. I do like tiffin boxing. Where is
your's. I will give you each one and you can do the work. We are all
sharing. Oh no. Those look uncommonly like baked beans to me.
They look good baked means. I have to say without contradiction they
are the finest baked beans I have eaten in my life. I think it is all
too jofrpb womening, there is too much going on. It is food produce  
There was all too much going on. is food for people, by the people.
It is a tiffin box it is hardly revolutionary. Why revolutionary
and radical, we have had barbecue, what could be, burnt meat goes back
to the dawn of time. Tony has no idea his main course has split the
judges. And his fate now rests with his desert. Michael's up first with
another updated classic, oat meal and hazelnut meringues with
rasberries and cream. It is their last chance to impress the judges,
Michael has planned a little surprise. In the nick of time, a
bottle of whiskey is hidden between the meringues and his dish is ready
Oh my goodness. I feel intimidated. I feel very happy. It has booze
inside. It's raspberry ripple with a Scottish tiple! You can pull it
off with your fingers. There is not too much cream, rasberries and the
koul lisence give it a bit of an acidic jerk. I think this is a
fabulous pudding. I love the drama of it. It is a spectacular work of
art, it is a dish for sharing. It moves through all the sort of
criteria. Cheers. Whatever it is, it is a tonsil
tickler. Michael's meringue have hit the
spot. But they are yet to taste Tony's chocolate revenge. His final
showdown is a layered chocolate mouse with tk kal garnishs and
short great biscuits. It requires a stead   technical garnishs, and
shortbread biscuits. It requires a steady hand. It requires a steady
hand, and if he doesn't get it right the judges will penalise
them.'S Making a white chocolate bomb filled with puree. It appears
to be holding, he place it is on the mouse, and the edible dipping
shards. Chocolate revenge. Interesting these daggers of
chocolate. We have to break them off. You will have to smash open an
egg. Inside. That is good check late. All right, so so far the
chocolate is good. Look at that, is that drama or what.
Mouse, mouse, mouse. The amount of time that has gone
into the construction of the pudding, and then to leave it with
three predy bland mousses inside. Can we not forget we are knocked
out about it when it came in, very dramatic. It is like being visited
by an ancient relative, you haven't seen for many years and you
remember why. With all eight dishes sent, there
is nothing the chefs can do now but await their fate. The judges
already have an idea who is behind which menu, but won't find out for
sure, until they have picked a winner. It was a lot to digest
there. Matthew, have you made up your mind? Yes I have. Yes I have.
So have I. Tony, Michael, welcome. So, Matthew
have you made up your mind? Yes, it will be menu B for me. Menu A for
me. I'm menu B. So you're not sure who menu B is, let's find out.
The chef going forward to represent Scotland in the finals of the Great
British Menu, is... Michael Smith! Congratulations.
Well done Michael. Time to answer some of the foodie questions, the
callers will help us decide what Lara is having at the end of the
show. Caroline from Reading is on the
line. What is your question? What is the best accompaniment for a
duck breast? Both of you can have a go? We use it with beetroot at
present, lovely roasted beetroot, elderflower, nice.
I would go more Asian, I would some pack choi, fried a little bit in
ground nut oil, ground ginger a whole chilli pepper into that, I
would brush the duck breast with honey, and put the spice mix uer I
had earlier on and fry it on the breast. Heaven or hell? Heaven.
Next caller please. Hello, there is a lot of wild ceps around, I was
wondering if it is possible to try to store or pickle them for use in
the winter. First of all, you have blown it you have told everybody
where they are, you won't have many left this afternoon, what do you
reckon, keeping ceps? Ceps is probably one of the best mushrooms
to freeze, if they are small, freeze them on a tray, nice and
flat. Raw? Raw, make sure they are nice and clean. When you come to
cook them, cook them semi defrost, beautifully sauted, like I did
earlier this morning, or dried, you can preserve them if they are white,
in olive oil, put herbs in it and leave them to next year. What dish
would you like to see, heaven or hell? Nothing but hell for me!
Gary are you there? What would you like to ask us? I have grown some
pinapple sage, what do you do it. grow this stuff in the garden, it
smells of pinapple but doesn't taste of it? It smells but once you
cook it loses the flavour of the pinapple. I would use it as sage,
pork, stick it with knock key, mashed potato, treat it as normal
sage. Heaven or hell? Heaven. get down to business, you know the
story now. Simon you failed to be on our board this year. You are up
there. Room for improvement, as they called it on my home economics
cookery book as I was at school. Screens. Three Michelin stars
Screens. Three Michelin stars It's right. I don't think the salt
got in there. We're on a health kick. It is the
butter I like. They are both passed. So, Andrew. You did it a lot
quicker. Look at them. You did it in 30.54
seconds, right there. That's a pretty good time. Is it?
You're on breakfast shift tomorrow, chef. It's a long time since I have
done that. Simon, I'm going to let you go on the board, we need to
change the yellow in the printer, look at the colour of your face?
Next to Brian Turner! You did it in 30.51 seconds, you are right just
there. I think it is that Riviera tan! Will later are get her food
heaven or hell. The majority of callers were going for hell, the
studio audience have yet to decide. We will find out after Keith Floyd
from France. He has invited himself to a French family kitchen, mainly
because the director likes to look at their house. Floyd is making up
for it by cooking them lunch. Take again, there is a cameraman in the
tree. All I'm trying to do is a little cooking sequence, light
lunch for friends of mine. I know you expect to find me in the posh
kitchens and restaurants, sometimes it is really nice to come in family.
This is what we have done. Because the director is really obsessed
with architecture, he's chosen this house, not because of the wonderful
kitchen, it isn't that good, he loves the shape of the whole
building. So here I am, if it's not too much trouble for you, Clive,
come out of the blinking tree and into the kitchen. Is that all right,
good, see you in a moment. Thank you very much. I'm cooking
Sunday lunch for my friend Michelle and Henri, it is a sue Bosnian Serb
and classic Britney dish, chicken roasted in cider, they have never
heard of it, typical. We are roasting a chicken, I'm going to
serve it with baked apples stuffed with walnuts and raisins, you will
see it later on. That is one part of T I will serve it with a
vegtable of fresh artichoke, absolutely cleaned out, just the
heart and luefly leaves. Come over here, stuffed with what we call
legumes, baby carrots, peas and turnips, it will be like this. You
will see all this later, film is very expensive and the director is
much happen year taking pictures of houses and architecture than
cooking bits. While you were out playing in the garden, I was busy
in the oven here. Come on down, I have got the chicken. A free range,
there are two of them. Two free  range farm's chickens roasted on a
bed of shallots and carrots. I need to put some splend dit Britney  
Brittany cider in it. That will take two hours. If you
would like to turn around you will find Michelle and Henri busily
preparing the or dufrs. claully flower. Cauliflowwer.
are you cooking langoustines for lunch? It is the quickest meal you
can find, I'm very lazy. Usually in Brittany very often we begin with
langoustine, they are fresh, nice and easy to cook. The only thing
you have to know sue mustn't leave them to cook too long   is you
mustn't leave them to cook too long. How long then? The water was
boiling, you put them in water boiling with some sea salt, and
then you wait, the first boiling, and that's all. Because if you
leave them a little longer, they will be soft and not good to eat.
We like to eat but we don't have a lot of time to make it. Usually all
the family is coming in the kitchen at the same time, the children are
putting the table on, I'm doing something, my husband is doing
something else. In ten minutes everything is OK. Allibidy boiling
and there is a white cream on it, then they are ready. You just stop
and then wait, hot and very there you are.
It's ready. You just need a dish now.
Henri has dropped a booboo he hasn't got the plate ready,
mother's going to be furious! Well, for me it is finished, the
mayonnaise on top of that, we do the mayonnaise, we take five
minutes, two minutes, not more, it is ready to eat, it is very nice
only if it is not cold. It is much, much nicer when they are just
cooked OK. We do the mayonnaise now. Any way the time has come for me to
go, life isn't just one happy round of langoustines, I have to carry on
cooking, because these wonderful people won't get to eat unless I
bring in my bishop. You carry on, all of you, enjoy yourselves, I
will do the hard work. We left this sequence with the
munching and crunching running on because I was so enjoying lunch, I
completely forgot the camera and for a while I really felt at hom.
That is what the French are about, food is family and sharing. This is
a little dish which I hope you will enjoy enormously. That is my
sweated Labour this morning, everybody will be eating
langoustines, the director has been up trees. I want to, for the
benefit of everybody, recap on how this was cooked. It is a simple
roast chicken on a bed of shallots and onions, and carrots, roasted in
butter, I poured cider into it, it cooked for about an hour, I put
kord apple stuffed with walnuts and sugar, and nuts, I put them in the
oven with the chicken, and then I strained the as you over a receive.
It is a classic Britanny dish, they don't know what it is.
Bacon, carrots, little turnips, lettuce, in stuff like that, no
water, then into the cleaned out shells of artichoke. That is what I
have done. Bon appiteit. He's saying it smells good, let's
hope it tastes good. The usual Doubting Thomas routine. It was a
success, but they had never heard of my Britanny chicken and cider
dish. We had a tart au pomme and cheese for afters. Made with
love,um um. I love watching those, more classic
Floyd on next week's show. Now let's find out if later are is
facing food heaven or hell. Food heaven would be this piece of
salmon. Delicious. Which Andrew was a gentleman he wanted food heaven.
That was 2 2, however, foot hell could be bananas. What do you
reckon to the rest of the three decided to go for? Of course,
bananas. Unfortunately they did. Blame these. Andrew was the gent
amongst everybody. That is the last time I go down to the Riviera.
You can make a little custard and do the pastry. I need to line the
start for this. First thing we are going to get on is the pastry.
Simon will shoi you how it is made. Butter, flower, vanilla, sugar and
egg. That   butter, flour, vanilla, sugar and being. That I can do.
Making pastry, make it by hand, that is the key. By making it by
hand you actually keep it nice and short, if you make it in a machine
it tend to toughen up a bit too much, especially if you are doing
something else. Your gran used to cook and you would have the
Yorkshire Kurd tarts you would put them in your mouth and they would
almost melt, that is because she used to sit and rub butter and
flour together while watching coronary. Literally she would do
that. Corrie, literally she would do that and make amazing pastry.
You put it above the mould and drop it in, don't stretch the pastry at
this point. That sits in the bottom. You know I'm never going to make it,
don't you, it is my hell. trying to tempt you, three million
people at home might want to make it! Pop it round like that. I don't
trim the pastry until the end. What I do is, you have, I use clingfilm,
not any of those fancy baking beans. A little bit of flour, just use
clingfilm. Some rice. Baking beans are good
because you can keep them for longer. In the restaurant we never
have enough. You put it in the fridge, bake it blind, then we have
got one that's in the oven that has been baking blind. Now, this has
gone in there, roughly for about 15 minutes, at about 170. There you go.
We lift off our rice there. You can't use the rice after that,
before you ask. At that stage your egg, and while it is still warm we
President Bush it with he can coke. Any   he can yolk, any little holes
it has it seals them up   egg yolk, it can seal up any holes in it.
Don't do too many. I don't know what's wrong with
these things. See to me it is the ultimate comfort food. When you are
ill, bananas and custard. We have rum in there as well.
My mum would put rum in there to make you better, but also knock you
out when you were six years old, and pop that, reduce the
mark three and gently cook it. For about half an hour until it sets.
Then we end up with this. Oh, it could be a quiche, if I cheated my
brain. Some sugar and butter, rum? Rum spice, like Carmel. This is the
pastry, that is the idea. You rub the butter and the flour together
to get it nice and fine, then add the sugar, then the vanilla and
then an egg and mix it together it creates it delegate short pastry,
which is what we want. Finish it off. You can leave it to colour
like this. I just finish this off. Caramelises
the top. You can use icing sugar on the top. Rar than just eggy it has
a bit of flavour to it. We can lift this off.
The sin man smells good! It is taking the way of banana for me.
It does look good, I give you that. We have the bananas. Looking good.
These are the cinnamon and nutmeg bananas.
Then, of course, me being me, it has to have either ice cream on it,
which would be great, but we have got clotted cream.
Riviera cream. I'm not diving but I will try. We don't often get food
hell on this show, to be honest. Frbts don't they know I'm part of
MI5, I can come after them. It is not you, the intreedent. Everybody
has salmon but seeing something like this and doing it differently.
Dive into it. I will be brave. won't kill you? I know. It is
bananas and custard, the best combination in the world. Do you
know, it is not hell. Doing with this a Mavrodaphne Patras Kourtaki
has been chosen. �5.99.
I'm going to be brave enough to try his bananas as well.
I can do that. Unfortunately you are left holding that. That is all
for Saturday Kitchen, that is to Simon Hulstnoe Lara Pulver and
