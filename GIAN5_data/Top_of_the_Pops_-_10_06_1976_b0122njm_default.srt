Hello there, and welcome to this week's edition
of Top Of The Pops.
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of life there
  Ooh
  Then I suddenly see you
  Ooh
  Did I tell you I need you?
Every single day
Of my life
Got to get you into my life
I got to get you into my life
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
Hold me tight
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
  Ooh, ooh
  You were meant to be near me
  Ooh, ooh
  And I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together
Every day
Got to get you into my life
I got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
  I want to stay there
  I want to stay with you
And if I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
  Ooh
  Then I suddenly see you
  Ooh
  Oh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day
Of my life
Got to get you into my life
I got to get you into my life
When I call you up your line's engaged
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life...
Oh, delightful, delightful! A somewhat sumptuous way
to get this edition of Top Of The Pops underway.
That's my record of the week this week
on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show   The Surprise Sisters,
and Got To Get You Into My Life. Going back a few weeks now,
because this is already going very well in the chart  
in fact it's this week's number five   The Real Thing, and You To Me Are Everything.
Mmmmm, I would take the stars out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling if you ask me to
I'd do anything for you Your wish is my command
I could move a mountain when your hand is in my hand
Words could not express how much you mean to me
There must be some other way to make you see
If it takes my heart and soul you know I'd pay the price
Anything that I possess I'd gladly sacrifice
Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I can sing
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
To you I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time you're down
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
You give me just a taste of love to build my hopes upon
You know you got the power, girl To keep me holding on
So now you got the best of me
Come on and take the rest of me
Oh, baby
Mmmmm, though you're close to me we seem so far apart
Maybe given time you'll have a change of heart
If it takes for ever, girl Then I'm prepared to wait
The day you give your love to me won't be a day too late
Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I can sing
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
To you I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time you're down
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
You give me just a taste of love to build my hopes upon
You know you got the power, girl To keep me holding on
So now you've got the best of me

  Yeah, yeah
  The sweetest song that I can sing
  Oh, baby
  You are everything to me
  Oh, baby
  Can't you see?
  You to me are everything
  You are everything...
A very favourite record of mine. It's a very interesting top 30
at the moment   Gallagher & Lyle, Candi Staton on the one hand,
soulful sounds like that from The Real Thing,
then you got comedy numbers like JJ Barrie   oops, sorry!  
wash my mouth out   the Wurzels at number one. We'll see them a bit later.
And a nostalgic feel at this week's number 27
from Dion, and The Wanderer.
Oh, well, I'm the type of guy
Who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are
Well, you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em
Cos to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em, they don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, mmm
Oh, well There's Flo on my left arm
And there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl Well, that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt
And I got Rosie on my chest
Cos I'm a wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, mmm
Well, I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron
But I'm going nowhere
Oh, yeah, I'm the type of guy
That likes to roam around
I'm never in one place
I roam from town to town
And when I find myself
Falling for some girl
Yeah I hop right into that car of mine
I drive around the world
Yeah, I'm a wanderer
Yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around Around, around, yeah...
Oh, yeah, I'm the type of guy
That likes to roam around
I'm never in one place
I roam from town to town
And when I find myself
Falling for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine
Drive around the world
Cos I'm a wanderer
Yeah, a wanderer...
  Here's a song that's appropriate for Bicentennial Year.
A history lesson from The Sensational Alex Harvey Band
and The Boston Tea Party.

There they were, sweating it out at the Boston Tea Party.
It's the little perspirations that make all the difference.
The Alex Harvey Band. If you're wondering what he was holding,
that's known as a drell spoon, just as in Archie Bell & The Drells,
who are doing a bit of walking.

  And now we've got some gentlemen from Dagenham.
Very first time they've been on the programme. Best of luck to Flintlock
and Dawn.
Dawn is breaking
This heart of mine
My heart is aching
Don't you think it's time
You come back
  I need you so
  Come back
  I got to tell you so
  You come back
I want you for my own
I told you that I never needed anyone
You cried and said that we were through
I can't forget you and there's no place left to run

  Gosh, gosh, gosh,
don't they look young? That's Flintlock,
first time on the programme. They're hovering just outside the top 30.
Now, it's a long time since we had an artist on Top Of The Pops
from behind the Iron Curtain. In fact I can't remember the last time.
While you're pondering on that, here's Bryan Ferry.
And now the marriage vow is very sacred
The man's put us together now
You ought to make it stick together
Come on, come on Let's stick together
You know we made a vow
Not to leave one another never
But now you never miss your water
Till your well runs dry
Come on, now, baby
Give our love a try
And stick together
Come on, come on Let's stick together
You know we made a vow
To leave one another never
Well, if you're stuck for a while
Consider our child

We stick together
Come on, come on Let's stick together
You know we made a vow
Not to leave one another never
  Oh

Consider our child

I'm surprised that lad can play his harmonica when she's doing that.
Maybe that's what they mean by dancing the body music.

Oh, happy chappies, aren't they?
Osibisa, and they were dancing the body music.
  They've just come...
Thank you. They've just come from that part of the world where they grow little Rolf Harrises.
No, not the West Country! That's where The Wurzels come from.
I drove my tractor through your haystack last night
Oo arr, oo arr
I threw my pitchfork at your dog to keep quiet
Oo arr, oo arr
Now something's telling me that you're avoiding me
Oo arr, oo arr
Come on, now, darlin' You got something I need
Cos I got a brand new combine harvester
And I'll give you the key
Come on, now, let's get together in perfect harmony
I got 20 acres
And you got 43
Well, I've got a brand new combine harvester
And I'll give you the key...
She made I laugh! Ha ha!
I'll stick by you
I'll give you all that you need
Oo arr, oo arr
We'll have twins and triplets
  I'm a man built for speed
  Oo arr, oo arr
And you know I love you, darlin'
  So give me your hand
  Oo arr, oo arr
The thing I like the most is all your acres of land
Cos I got a brand new combine harvester
And I'll give you the key
Come on, now, let's get together in perfect harmony
I got 20 acres
And you got 43
Well, I've got a brand new combine harvester
And I'll give you the key...
You're a nice bit of stuff, an' all!
For seven long years I've been alone in this place
Oo arr, oo arr
Pigs sleep in the kitchen It's a proper disgrace
  Oo arr, oo arr
  And if I cleaned it up
  Would you change your mind?
  Oo arr, oo arr
I'll give up drinking scrumpy and that lager and lime
Cos I've got a brand new combine harvester
And I'll give you the key
Come on, now, let's get together in perfect harmony
I got 20 acres
And you got 43
Well, I've got a brand new combine harvester
And I'll give you the key...
Weren't we a grand couple at that last Wurzels dance?
I wore brand new gaiters and me corduroy pants
In your new Sunday dress
With your perfume smelling grand
We had our photos took and us holding hands
Well, I've got a brand new combine harvester
And I'll give you the key
Now that we're both past our 50s I think that you and me
Should stop this gallivanting
And will you marry me?
Well, I've got a brand new combine harvester
And I'll give you the key...
Arr, you're a fine looking woman,
and I can't wait to get my hands on your land! Ha ha!
Oo arr, oo arr! I'll be on the breakfast programme tomorrow.
Do hope you'll join me. I'm going to leave you with a rather nice sound.
What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife?
You count up the years
And they will be filled with tears
Love only breaks up
To start over again
You'll get the babies
But you won't have your man
While he's busy loving
Every woman that he can
Uh huh...
