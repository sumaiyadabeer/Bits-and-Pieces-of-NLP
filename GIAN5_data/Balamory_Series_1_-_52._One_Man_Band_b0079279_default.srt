Oh, yeah.
  Oh! Sounds like we have a visitor.
I wonder who it could be.
  Hi, Miss Hoolie!
  Hi there, Spencer!
  Hi, guys!
  Hi!
  You seem very excited!
  Oh!
  I'm playing in the street festival this year!
  Oh, on the mainland?
  Yeah! I'm so excited!
  Oh, great! Will you be playing your guitar?
I don't know. Many people do that. I wanted to do something different!
  That would make me stand out.
  What about playing...the maracas?
  SHE HUMS A TUNE AND GIGGLES Those are cool.
  Yeah!
Or how about the tambourine?
  RATTLE RATTLE! Can I have a go?
  Yeah.
Oh!
  Whoa!
  But it's not very tuneful.
Hmm, right. ..Oh, I can't decide which instrument to play this year!
Oh.
Why not try a kazoo?
  A what?
  A kazoo. You can play any tune on that!
  Great! You got one?
No, but PC Plum has. He played it at last year's Christmas party.
  Could I borrow it?
  You could ask. Why don't you go and see him now?
  That's a good idea. Well, wish me luck!
  Good luck, Spencer.
So... Which coloured house will Spencer visit first today?
Can you see all the different coloured houses sitting by the sea?
This part of the story in Balamory
Asks, "Which house is for me?"
Is it green? Is it red? Or should I go to the white instead?
Yellow, pink, orange or blue Which coloured house am I going to?
Which coloured house are we going to? Tell me what you think
Which house are we going to? Tell me   what do you think?
It's the white house!
Yes! It's the white house, because that's where PC Plum lives.
  Nice rhythm, Plummie!
  Hi, Spencer. So, what's the story in Balamory?
  Well, I was wondering if I could hear your kazoo.
  Oh, certainly.
Now, it's here somewhere. I just had it. Where did I...?
  Oh, there we are. Do you want me to play you something?
  Sure.
Wow! What a great sound!
  Could I borrow it?
  Are you going to mix paint with it?
No. I'm gonna play at the musical festival this year,
  and I want to play that.
  As long as you take care of it.
  Oh, I will.
Man, this is gonna sound great! BUZZ!
  What about your other instruments?
  I didn't know which one to play.
So Miss Hoolie suggested I try this.
You could decide by playing all of them.
Great idea! Stay here. I'm gonna go to my trike and get my instruments.
"When The Saints Come Marching In!"
  ..the saints go marching in.
  Let me help you.
  Here we go!
There you go.
  Oh.
  Oh, thank you.
  There we are.
Phew! Thanks.
  These are great, because they all do different things.
  What do you mean?
The drum is good for keeping rhythm.
The guitar is great for strumming a tune!
STRUM! STRUM! Oh, yeah! Um, let me see...
And the cymbals are great for a dramatic crash!
  Oh! Well, you can say that again!
Oh! And this accordian! This thing is just cool!
  So, which one are you gonna choose?
  Um...
All of 'em! One, two! A one, two, three!
  Oh!
  Spencer, you can't play all of them.
  I know!
They're great in different ways. I don't know which one to choose.
  You'll have to decide soon.
  It's so difficult. What'll I do?
Why don't you call on Archie? He could invent something
  to bring them together. You won't have to choose just one.
  Right!
Here I come, Archie!
I'm Archie, the inventor

Call Archie, and I'll help you.
  Hey, Archie!
  Ah. Hello, Spencer.
Er...
  What's all this, Spencer?
  A problem.
  A large one, by the looks of it.
  So, what's the story in Balamory?
  Well...
I've decided to play an instrument
at the street festival this year, but I can't decide which one.
Miss Hoolie played her maracas and tambourine, which were brilliant!
But not very tuneful. She said PC Plum's kazoo might sound better.
Then, I remembered the instruments I love,
like the cymbal, the drum, the guitar!
But I can't decide what I like best.
They're all different and all great.
To tell the truth, I want to play them all at the same time.
So I was wondering if you had any idea what I can do.
Hmm. A musical problem? I'm sure I can do something.
Now, where can I start?
  The drum   lovely sound.
Guitar   hmm, very exciting.
Er... Oh, I know!
Now, you see?
If you play each of these one by one in order very fast,
it'll sound like you're playing them at once.
Hey! I think that'll work. OK.
KAZOO BUZZES All right.
  I don't think this'll work.
  Er, no. Don't worry. We're just warming up.
Um, er... Hmm.
  Of course! That's it!
BUZZ! Oh! What is?
The answer. It's staring me in the face   a one man band.
  I'll make you into a one man band.
  Is it gonna hurt?
  Right, er...
  OK. Stand up, please, Spencer.
  Oh.
  There we go.
  Oh!
Hold steady.
One cymbal.
Round we come.
There we go.
  Oh.
  Bang your legs together.
  Hey, Archie! I think you're onto something!
  What next? Oh! The drum!
Ah. ..I can't wait to show Miss Hoolie what we've done!
  Hi, Archie!
  Hello, Miss Hoolie.
  Where's Spencer? At the festival?
  Not yet. First, we have a surprise for you.
  Oh! Great! What is it?
Roll up, ladies and gentlemen! We have a special treat for you.
Give a warm welcome to the world famous one man band, Spencer!
All right, guys? I'm gonna sing a song.
  This is called When The Saints Go Marching In.
  Take it away, Spencer.
Oh, when the saints... BUZZ! BUZZ!
Go marching in! When the saints go marching in!
BUZZ! CRASH! Oh, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in! BUZZ! CRASH!
Sing!
Oh, when the saints go marching in!
When the saints go marching in!
CRASH! TING! BUZZ! Oh, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching... Let's march!
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in!
Oh, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in!
Oh, yeah! MUSIC STOPS
  All right, guys! Well done!
  Well done!
Oh, Archie! What a clever idea!
Spencer is having so much fun!
Oh, yes. And just think what he'll have when he's at the festival.
All right, now! CYMBALS CRASH
OK! It's great to be here in this beautiful sunny day on the mainland.
And I'll be singing you one of my favourite songs as a one man band!
Spencer, the one man band! OK, here we go!
Oh, when the saints... BUZZ! BUZZ!
Go marching in!
Oh, when the saints go marching in!
BUZZ! CRASH! Oh, I want to be in that number
Oh, when the saints go marching in...
Oh, I want to be in that number
Oh, when the saints go marching in!
Thank you!
Thank you! ..And thank you, Archie!
So, what was the story in Balamory today?
Well...
Spencer couldn't decide which instrument to play
at the festival this year.
He thought about the drums, the kazoo, the guitar,
just about every instrument he could get his hands on.
It was left for Archie to come up with the answer to the problem.
He turned Spencer into a one man band.
This is what Spencer wanted.
He could play his instruments at the same time!
After playing for the children in the nursery,
he went off and performed at the festival and was a smash hit.
So, that was the story in Balamory.
See you next time. Bye.
