CBeebies Bedtime Story.
No. That's too big.
Ah. Too small.
Oh, hello. I'm Charlie.
I'm just testing out these spoons for an egg and spoon race.
And this one is perfect.
Just give it a go.
Perfect!
Do you know what? There's a special egg in tonight's Bedtime Story.
So special that the story was named after him.
Of all the suspicious houses in all the deserted woods
in all the world, he had to roll up to hers.
Foxy Dubois was utterly charming and always kind to strangers,
so she invited Egg in for a bite to eat.
Whilst Foxy skipped off to the kitchen,
Egg rolled around the grand house.
"You have some interesting paintings," shouted Egg.
But Foxy wasn't listening.
She was too busy cooking up a perfect cunning plan.
Foxy wanted the biggest, most delicious egg to eat,
so she put part one of her sneaky plan into action.
She would feed Egg up.
When dinner was served, it was a very splendid affair.
Egg wobbled with excitement.
Foxy wanted a big egg, but she also wanted a fit egg.
So, after dinner, she put part two of her devious plan into action.
They would play games.
They had an egg and spoon race in the hallway,
they played hide and seek in the library,
At the end of the night, Egg was in a complete spin.
It had been a delightful evening,
but he needed to rest his weary shell.
"You simply must stay over," said Foxy.
"I have something even more wonderful planned for breakfast."
Foxy spent the night dreaming eggy dreams.
There were scrambled eggs and fried eggs,
poached eggs and baked eggs and best of all,
soft boiled eggs and soldiers.
But when Foxy Dubois awoke the next morning, she was in for a shock.
During the night, something had changed.
Egg was a fragile little thing no more.
He was enormous!
Foxy rubbed her hands with glee. Her crafty plan had worked.
It was going to be a big breakfast.
But just then, Egg started to crack.
Foxy lipped her lips.
Crack! She licked her lips some more.
Them with one final crack, Foxy saw what was inside.
"Good morning," said Alfonso wickedly.
"Am I in time for breakfast?"
And that story was called "Egg".
I don't think there will be. Do you?
Well, while I keep practising for my egg and spoon race,
it's time for you to go to bed
and I'll see you soon for another Bedtime Story. Night night.
Here we go.
