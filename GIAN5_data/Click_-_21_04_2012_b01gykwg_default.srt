Did you think you were in charge of the machines? Not any more. Now,
This week, Click is in Liverpool at the art exhibition designed to test
our relationship with robots and each other. But are you ready to
become a digital been? As a rapper Tupac is resurrected for one final
peak, we show you how this holographic effect was achieved.   
gig. And a side that has control of your online mutterings in Webscape.
Welcome. It is pretty certain that in the future, we will all be
talking to each other more and more using technology. Communicating
with people who are a fair distance away, as if they were in the same
room. Now, I am not just talking about video calling your mother.
There are many more ways in which you can make your presence felt and
feel that of somebody else's from afar. That is why we have come to
this exhibition which explores some of those ideas. It is called Robots
and Avatars. Part art, part technology, this is
a collection of works exploring ways in which we made few others
and ourselves as digital beings.    view. The artists have pondered
questions like how do we feel about seeing ourselves on screen? How
would it feel to look more of our lives in virtual bodies? And how
would it feel to let machines take more control over our real bodies?
This work, for example, called Base 8 invited to transform your hand
into a virtual one to experience the feeling of handling non 
existent particles. As more and more devices become controlled
using gestures, we may have to get used to moving things around which
we cannot actually feel. Maybe manipulating particles in a virtual
chemistry lab or remotely controlling that will hand from
thousands of miles away. You may instead want to use your phone to
control a bop    A Bott, bot's voicebox. This is a daunting figure
designed to give a voice to others who may otherwise be lost in the
crowd. He certainly is hard to ignore. Some of robotic
interpretations are far more tenuous. Take a leader   a giant
globe covered with pieces of coal and filled with a mixture of you in
bed to make it floaty. Aida has been described as an analogue robot.
Something that is remote controlled by quite a few people at one time.
But in no way did Italy. The point, does it say something about what
happens when people try to be cholate    created at once? Maybe.
And from the physical to the emotional. Some of the works are
designed to capture our feelings. The electronic man is a website
which sources emotions from users around the world. If the project
gains momentum, it could provide a guide to the happiest places on
earth and the most stressful. If crossing continents is not your
thing, you now have many ways to talk to people on the other side of
the world. If you years ago, Second Life was briefly all the rage. A 3D
space in which your avatar could build a home, the business and
relationships with others, no matter where their flesh and blood
fissions decided. Although the buzz around it has died down, its ideas
live on. This project, Visions of our Communal Dreams, attempts to
show how a virtual world may blend with the real one. Not only can you
fly your avatar around this island, meeting and interacting with others
virtually, but it can also see and talk to real people as well. Fly to
one of several portals of the island and you will find a window
to a particular place in the real world. Cameras and projectors allow
real and virtual people to converse across the physical and virtual
divide. More of this later. And finally, something much more
unnerving. It is designed to test out trust in technology. Will we
ever reach a point where we let the robot drive us about? How easy
would it be to give over physical control to a machine? I am about to
find out. World!    I do not have much choice
about which way it wants me to go. This frightening looking beast is
called Compass and has the ability to spin you around. It has its own
ideas about the route you should walk and, specifically, it will not
let you walk into the rectangles of light. It is guided by a small
magnetic field under the carpet and gets its talk by spinning
heavyweights in the opposite direction.
This is kind of awesome but it is not very nice. The Compass is
really insisted on where it wants me to go and where it does not want
me to go. It is really strong. It is very difficult to resist when it
turns you. I guess this is what it We are back with Ede, the giant
inflatable robot/avatar. And our guest, Professor Noel Sharkey.   
aider. Welcome to Click. Is there anything you and your profession
can learn from this? Quite a lot. I love working with artists and
designers because they explore domains we do not look at. We are
good at Engineering. But if you want real beauty and an exploration
of new ideas, this is the way to go. I would recommend we do this kind
of arts in our schools. And we are teaching robotics. There has been a
lot of talk about how a i is getting better. What Aires is it
particularly good at? And for what parts of simulating real life?   
areas. There has been a lot of talk since the 50s. In the 70s, we would
have all household Tours does. One thing we are good at is making
false predictions.    tours. The areas we are good at his robotics.
There is a lot of work in robotics in things like farming, picking
fruit, cleaning floors, a lot of cleaning tasks. The reason for this
is until the 1980s, the big ambitions were to make a big
thinking robot machine. That was almost impossible. Machines were
moving so slowly. You could hardly see them moving. So we moved from a
fast sensor type operation, stop trying to make multi purpose
machines. Now, there is one robot that will clean and sweep the floor,
one that will market, and one that will clean the windows. That is the
area where we are making progress. Single purpose robots. Also the
area of telly robotics. That is becoming major. It has become
really begin surgery, particularly in the US. It is robotic assistance
for a surgeon. The surgeon moves the hand but the robot takes out
tremors and so it is good progress. I have been told in the past that
it is the sensors on any were bought or system that is still
letting us down, the ability to in per    interpret the world and act
on it. Is that still the case? is but it is not the sensors
themselves. They are becoming remarkable with nanotechnology. We
are making incredible infrared sensors. Sonar sensors take out
certain problems. But with vision, for example, back in the 1950s, we
thought we would saw fit in ten years but we have seen little
progress. We can classify a telephone or a cup, put the two
together and you have a cup of a phone or something but it is poor.
Thank you. There is a lot here and a sure it will fire your
imagination. Get in touch. Next   this week's Tech News.
Scientists at the University of Glasgow have pioneered a way to use
3D printers to create drugs and other chemicals. The process
involves a robotic we controlled syringe, building the drugs out of
the gel based ink into which chemicals and catalysts are mixed.
It is thought manufacturers, doctors and even the public could
use the technique to download, pre  set recipes and Taylor medicines to
individual's means. Greenpeace warns of the environmental impact
towards the trend towards cloud computing. A new report breaks some
of the biggest firms on how efficient they are data farms are.
Google performed well while Apple and amazon were rated poorly. The
canteen group says if the cloud was a country, it would be the fifth
biggest polluter on the planet. Apple, which do not provide
information for the report, disputed the figures and says it is
currently building greener power supplies. Microsoft says its next
operating system, Windows eight, will come in four flavours,
including one designed for tablet. The Enterprise and professional
versions are aimed at business    businesses. This covert system
would also work on Pat strain laptops and includes versions of
Excel, PowerPoint and other operations. A US firm that asked
the public for $100,000 to create a new type of what has raised more
than $3 million in just one month. The what, which has a seven day
back to life, has an efficient display, links to the user's Apple
or android phone, allowing them to    alerting and e mails or messages.
It also runs cycling apps. It may even dispense cash at this rate!
Of    a window to a virtual world. At the moment, it does not look
like anybody his home. But the ideas and technology behind this
are now starting to bring more people together.
Most of us associate avatars with gaming. A fantasy character we
control in words    worlds where we fight battles and without fantasies,
even own Allam Ireland. Increasingly, the characters are
not carrying swords.    our own island. They wear normal clothes
and look like us because the virtual world they are in a not
fantasy but designed to mimic the real one. The most popular
applications are virtual meetings with the number of five 10 persons
for in 18. We have a virtual conferences where we have something
like 20 30 people up to hundreds of participants in a conference room.
And virtual trade shows where thousands of people visit a booth
and so on. Instead of getting crushed in the hustle and bustle of
trade shows, you can dig in and out from your desk or laptop.    dip.
And then there is the virtual classroom where student avatars
respond to the real person's movements, picked up by the camera
on their computer. Teachers can see who is paying attention by seeing
which way they are looking for posing questions and asking
students to raise their hands. Over the past few years, these spaces
have become more simple to create. Now, you can even design want using
a Facebook app. The use of avatars has several advantages over video.
It tends to use less bandwidth, allow more people to get involved,
with a little less personal There is nothing quite like seeing
someone's face. Their ears. I think he has a bit more hair now. While
many of us have become familiar with using services like Skype,
tech giant Cisco is taking it to a new level that is high definition
with no light time. It is called telepresence. Because as humans, we
understand much more than is being said. We have visual beans. 64% of
communication is non verbal. It is body language, the look in my eye,
the tone of my voice. Eyeballing someone across the table is
important. So rather than placing the camera that catches your image
above or below the screen you're looking at, US firm DVE have
managed to put it in the middle, behind the image of the person. The
screen is semi transparent plastic with a special metallic coating
that reflects a projected image of those being beamed in. A Monday
morning meeting at our offices. Not everyone has turned up but many
existing the new conferencing systems would struggle to bring
this many people together. That is no longer a problem. We may no
longer have an excuse to miss it at all. Here, we had 60 people brought
together using 19 different video feeds. Polycom says this system can
support more than 1,000 individual video streams. They do not all need
specialist kit. Chris is using an iPad here but he
could be used in any one of a variety of smartphones or tablets.
   using. Does that mean employees could be
forced into conferences at any time of the day like some are expected
to respond to e mail now. There is the ability now to work from
anywhere. Bosses might transfer    translate that in to an ability to
work any time. Of course, the work  life balance is something that
might be a challenge for everybody but there are other mechanisms
available. As telepresence becomes more realistic so our systems that
show more of the body and at a more useful visual tools. One of the
useful things is being able to gesture and use your hands as well
as your face and the whole body to communicate. We get to the point
now where through the connection of telepresence with other
technologies like software that allows you to move virtual objects
around, this enables a haptic interface to happen. Virtual 3D
technology is already being used to create effects like holograms on
stage. Most notably used last weekend at this performance between
a pre recorded Tupac and Snoop Dogg who performed live next to him. One
of the companies behind the performance showed us how it was
done based on an old Victorian Peter Aleutian called Pepper's
Ghost.    Theatre allusion    illusion. You have a projector here
and you move the screen here and across that space at a 45 degree
angle we have our patented foil which reflects the image up into
the consumer's face. There is a lot of backstage tinkering to get the
realistic effect. The performer and the image on the right can see and
hear each other, allowing the onstage artist to interact with the
projected one. That project is shooting imagery up that way and
going to the boil that way. I can see where I am and where Lucinda is
and I can interact. Musion makes its money from the Ming
performances live to theatres or stadiums globally. Another small
company thinks this is the way telepresence will be done in the
future. This system does not rely on a complicated stage set up.
Using projection, you can go right up to this image and a holographic
all volumetric effect is maintained.    or volumetric effect. To get
right up close, you might need to ditch the avatar and take the form
of a robot instead. A French firm but to inside of one, giving you a
physical presence in the room. Other things apart from your image
might be communicated. In the future, we will start to get
interfaces which deal with our breath, heartbeat, and touch
sensations. At the moment, telepresence is focused on the
visuals but as other things are added, one day we could literally
make our presence felt. In this increasingly virtual world,
it is not uncommon to have close friends you have never actually met.
Our very own Kate Russell is one of those friends. She never leaves the
studio and I only ever see her on wine. So, for one week only, we
brought her with us. She actually exists! Virtual pokes only if you
don't mind. I have a managed to escape my studio to cut here and
look at a few websites and apps related to this exhibition and
Liverpool itself. Replicants is the first of the
exhibition site I want to show you. This project lets you create a
posting but for Facebook or Twitter which will simulate your online
activity. By linking with your other social streams and adding key
words are vital interests, the bottom will analyse the kinds of
content you like in oddities and the size and online persona or that
is an extension of who you are. Once it is installed, you are
encouraged to activate the Klout app to track any increase in your
popularity. I have been running this for about a week and it has
been very pro active posting music suggestions. The first video it
posted on my behalf was this. I have to say it is probably the best
thing I have ever posted on That said, my Replicants soon went
a bit mutant, posting all sorts of random things from my Twitter feet.
So I eliminated it.    Twitter feed. Next up from reports and avatars, a
Naked on Pluto. You click on the reports and linked to your social
streams to turn them into a virtual world populated with people and
places you know. It is like a text  based adventure game. It creates a
simulation of your friends based on what it has learnt about you. This
gain is taxed based and I have a feeling it will have limited appeal.
An interesting passing curiosity nonetheless. Here is at an unusual
search tall. The results are not extensive but they are compiled
into a media with a robotic voice narrating. Here is what it told me
about this exhibition. Robots and Avatars is a programme of events
and educational activities which explores how young people will work
and play with your representations of physical form. Since we are on
location, it was a great excuse to turn out    try out some location
based apps. Most cities have an events listings site like Liverpool
Live, where you can Plan A night out and buy tickets. A growing
number of these sites offer a free smartphone app so you can organise
things on the move. Many places have Birchall to work out that will
shake you are a sight to the city might not otherwise have found.
LiveTour Liverpool maps out a five mile road starting at a train
station and leading the past historic buildings and other
interesting landmarks, including legendary live music venue the
cavern where the Beatles first made their name. It sucks the life out
of your battery at an alarming rate. That's all we have time for.
