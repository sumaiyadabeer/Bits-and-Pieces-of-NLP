  Big hug! Great to see all of you.
  Harley, are these your friends?
  Yes.
  What's your name?
  Cerys.
  Lovely to meet you. And what's your name?
  Rory.
  Good to meet you, too. How about you, what's your name?
  Yasmin.
  Lovely to meet you. Are you all excited about cooking?
  Yeah!
  What are we doing this afternoon?
  Parachute games.
  Brilliant!
We'll need lots of energy to play parachute games.
Shall I look in Horace and see if I can find some ingredients
  to make something to take?
  Yeah!
I'll have a look right now. Hold on.
Hey, team, you'll love these ingredients.
  Look what we've got. Do you know what this is?
  Oil.
  Oil.
  And how about this?
  Chocolate chips!
  Everyone say, yum yum in my tum!
  Yum yum in my tum!
  And what's this?
  Banana!
  No, it's a pear.
  Banana!
  I'm only joking, it's a banana.
  Shall we look in my cookbook to find a recipe?
  Yeah!
  Come on, let's go.
What's in my cookbook? Let's have a look.
What tasty treats are we going to cook?
What do you think it's going to be, everyone?
Wow! Look at those! We'll make chocolate and banana
  parachute parcels. They look amazing, don't they?
  Yeah!
They really do. But before start cooking, what must we do first?
  Wash our hands!
  We've got to wash our hands.
Come on, everyone, let's go.
Roll up your sleeves
Give your hands a wash with Slippy dippy soap
Splish splash splosh
Have you done your hands?
Washed and dried
Sleeves rolled up Apron tied
What can you do? I can cook!
Now we've washed our hands, let's start. Is everyone ready?
  Yeah!
  Who likes bananas?
  Me!
  I'm glad you like bananas
cos that's the first ingredient.
I've got one right here. Who can do the banana dance?
The first thing we've got to do, is be a great big banana.
We go   Peel banana, Peel, banana, peel, peel banana.
Then we chop, banana, chop, chop, banana.
Then we mash, banana, mash, mash banana.
  Everyone say, bananas!
  Bananas!
That was very good banana dancing, everyone. You were good, too.
Let's get some real banana peeling going on.
Take your banana and hold the top,
then just take the skin off.
Now take the banana and hold it out in front of you. That's it.
  Then we snap it in two. Snap!
  Snap!
And then put one half of the banana into your bowl,
and put the other half of banana on your plate. Now it's time
to mash the banana. We're going to mash it using back of a fork.
So just hold the bowl and use the back of the fork to mash it down.
Mash!
Just squash it down in the bowl. Who can say soft and squidgy?
  Soft and squidgy!
  Soft and squidgy banana!
Brilliant. Now we've got the banana,
but what else is missing from our banana and chocolate filling?
  Chocolate drops.
  Chocolate drops! You're right.
We'll take a teaspoon of chocolate drops. Everyone, take your teaspoon
and load it up with a big mountain of chocolate drops.
Then pop it into your bowl.
Then use your spoon to give the chocolate and the banana
and a really good mix.
Mixy, mixy, mixy.
Don't forget to mix with us at home. Remember, you get your bowl and then
you get your spoon, and what you do?
Mix, mix, mix. Well done. Brilliant.
There we go. That is our filling done.
The next thing is to make the wrap for our chocolate and banana
parcels. We do that using something called filo pastry.
I've kept it covered with a damp tea towel so it's easier to use.
First of all, we fold the filo pastry in half to make a rectangle.
We use our finger to slide down the fold, like this,
to make a nice line down the side. Then we snip down the line.
But remember, be careful with scissors,
everyone knows that we need to point them down towards our...?
  Toes!
  You got it. Snip down the fold in the pastry.
Just snip down the edge snip, snip.
Next, we want to make the rectangle into a square,
so fold it over again. Then we use our scissors to snip it.
Snip, snip, snip.
We need to be careful of our fingers.
Yeah. Now we've got eight squares of filo pastry
and we'll use for squares for each one of our parcels.
But first, we've got to do some painting.
Everyone, grab your brush, dip your brush into your oil.
Brush two of the holes in your muffin tin with the oil.
We're going to take one of our filo pastry squares,
and pop it on top of one of the muffin holes.
Then show me your fiddly fingers. Diddly diddly doo!
Use your fiddly fingers to gently push the pastry down.
It's like making a little bed. Then grab another piece of filo pastry,
get your fiddly fingers, and push it in.
We're going to do some dib dabbing.
So take a little bit of oil and we go, dib dab, dib dab dib.
Dibdy dabdy dabdy.
Put the last pieces of filo pastry in with your fiddly fingers,
and push. Brilliant. Take your bowl of filling
and scoop out half the mixture into each of your parcels.
There we go.
The next thing we do is squeeze and twist the parcels.
Who can do this, ready? You go, squeeze! That's it. And, twist!
Very good. Let's do it all together. Are you ready? Squeeze! And twist!
I nearly fell over. Now we're going to squeeze and twist parcels.
Squeeze, and twist.
Squeeze and twist.
Excellent. And that's it. You've done it, team. You've made chocolate
and banana parachute parcels and you've done it all by yourselves.
Now we just put these in the oven.
  That looks brilliant, Cerys.
  It's all over the table.
I know, it's a bit messy.
Remember, the oven is hot so don't go near.
You need to ask a grown up to help you here.
OK. These shouldn't take very long to cook.
  Honk!
  Thanks for reminding me, Horace. You're right.
We need to make everywhere tidy and clean.
Let's scrub those pots till they sparkle and gleam.
Now we've cooked
Let's wash up
Stack the plates And the bowls on top
Dishes and spoons
Splish splash splosh
Having fun while we tidy and wash
Dishes and spoons
Splish splash splosh
Having fun while we tidy and wash.
There we go, lovely and clean. Let's pop our things down.
Whilst our food's in the oven cooking,
  who wants to play parachute games?
  Me!
I thought you would. Why don't you come with us? Come on.
All our mums have joined us. Brilliant! We're all going to play
a game called fruit salad. Yasmin and Harley, you'll be bananas.
Cerys and Rory, you'll be strawberries.
And I'm going to be a grapefruit. We'll run underneath the parachute
and swap places with the other fruit that I call out. Bananas! Go!
Quick, bananas! Oh, that was quick.
Strawberries, go! Grapefruit, go!
Woo! Fruit salad! Go!
Bananas and strawberries!
Mums are going to be the sausages.
Sausages! Woo!
Fruit salad!
Quickly. The fruit salad is squashing.
Parachute games make me hungry. Shall we have a snack before
  we keep playing?
  Yeah!
  Honk!
  Listen, that's Horace telling us
our chocolate banana parachute parcels are ready.
You stay here, set out the picnic, I'll get the food.
Brilliant, I'll see you in just a minute.
Wow, great job, guys. This looks amazing. Are you hungry?
  Yeah!
  Good, have you told everyone what we made?
  Banana chocolate parachute parcels.
  Here they are.
Yellow was you. And green for you. Let's have a look at them.
Maybe they've changed in the oven.
  Would you like to try one of my parachute parcels?
  Yes, please.
Mmm, they're fabulous. How did you make them?
I had a banana, chocolate chips, oil and filo pastry.
  Can you show me how to make them at home?
  Yeah.
Mmm, would you like to have some?
  Do you like it?
  Yeah.
  What was your favourite part of making it?
Cutting the pastry.
I really like these. These are good, aren't they, guys?
What's happened to our parcels in the oven?
The banana's all brown and the chocolate chips have melted.
Remember what we did at the end of the recipe? We put our arms out,
didn't we? Then we squeezed the pastry and
twist!
That was really good. I've got loads more energy after these.
  Who wants to play more games with the parachute?
  Me!
Come on, then, guys. Let's go.
We've had a rest and a bite to eat
Now we're stronger than We were before
Something healthy in our tummies To help us play some more
Healthy food, hip hip hooray
Energy, hip hip hooray
To keep us going, hip hip hooray
And help us play, help us play
Hip hip hip hooray!
Coming, everyone!
  Who wants to play cat and mouse?
  Me!
  Brilliant, I thought so.
Rory, you'll be the mouse and go under the parachute.
Harley, you'll be the cat and go on top of the parachute. Everyone else,
He's over there!
  I've got him!
  He's got him! Yay!
OK, this time I'm going to be the cat, Harley you're the mouse.
Go!
Where is he? Where is he gone?
What's happening?
I've got you, Mr Mouse, I've got you.
  All of you will be the cats, so everyone go, Miaow!
  Miaow!
Shake the parachute, mums! Go!
You've got me!
This time, Rory, you can be the mouse.
Everyone else can be the cat, go, go, go!
We've had a wonderful day. Playing with our parachute has been fun.
Parachute parcels are a perfect snack to give us loads of energy to
play. If you want to make our quick and simple recipe then go to...
OK, who can get on top of the parachute... The fastest?
Go, go, go!
  Good fun. Have you all had fun today?
  Yeah!
  Have you had fun, too?
  Yeah!
  Brilliant.
  Everyone, what can you do?
  I can cook!
