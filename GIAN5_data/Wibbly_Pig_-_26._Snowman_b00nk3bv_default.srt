  Hey, Wibbly!
  Hey
When are we going to play today? Hey, Wibbly!
Hello
What are we going to see?
  Hey, Wibbly!
  What?
Where are we going to go today?
  Hey, Wibbly!
  That's me
Who are we going to be?
  Hey, Wibbly!
  Hey
Stop, we want to talk to you
  Hey, Wibbly!
  I'm here
Oh, are we playing hide and seek?
  Hey, Wibbly!
  Woohoo!
Wibbly Pig? Wibbly?
Where are you?
I can see your footprints.
Oh, bird. It's so cold, the bird bath has turned to ice.
Are you behind there, Wibbly?
Aha! Wibbly.
No, Scruffy.
Hiya, Scruffy Pig.
I'm making a snow heap. Look.
A scruffy snow heap.
Have you seen Wibbly Pig?
No. Why don't you follow the footprints?
OK. See you later.
Wibbly? Wibbly?
Wibbly Pig? Is that you, Wibbly?
It's Spotty Pig.
Hi.
And me.
Hello, Tiny Pig. What are you doing?
We're making a great big snowball.
Aren't we, Spotty Pig?
Yeah. Are you looking for Wibbly Pig?
Yeah.
  He's over there.
  Thanks. See you later.
That's not Wibbly Pig.
Surprise!
There you are. What are you doing?
Playing in the snow.
Brr. Aren't you cold?
No, because I'm wearing my special scarf.
Oh, it's a bit tickly.
And I've got my special gloves on.
See?
You look all toasty warm.
I'm roasty toasty warm.
Hey, watch what I can do.
Listen.
Crunch! Crunch! Crunch!
Whoa!
A snow angel!
Do you like my heap, Wibbly?
Yeah.
We've built a snowball, haven't we, Tiny Pig?
It's enormous.
  I want to make something too.
  Let's make something really good.
Hmm. What should we make?
Make a heap.
How do we make a heap?
It's easy.
You just push the snow together...
like this. There.
It's OK. It needs to be scruffier.
What else can we make, Wibbly?
A snowball!
Good idea.
You need to roll it on the ground now, Wibbly.
Ha ha, I know.
It's getting bigger.
And bigger.
And bigger.
And bigger.
  Finished.
  Wow!
It's even bigger than ours.
Hmm. What happens if you put a snowball on top of a heap?
Is it going to be a snowman?
No   a snow pig. Ha ha ha.
Yeah!
A Wibbly snow pig. Brilliant.
Some ears.
This...
This can be his nose.
There.
Some eyes,
and a mouth and finished!
Yeah! A Wibbly snow pig.
There's something missing.
I know.
Now he'll be nice and toasty warm.
Roasty toasty warm.
He moved!
Wow!
Ha ha ha. This scarf is tickly.
But tickly is fun.
Thank you.
Hey!
That's my scarf.
Wait!
Wait for me!
Can't catch me.
Where did he go?
Look! Footprints.
Shh! This way.
I think...
I think I'll stay here.
Got you!
Oh, no, you haven't.
I'm off!
Whoa!
Got you.
Huh? What? What's happening?
You're melting. The scarf is too warm.
You have to keep snow cold.
Ah! That's better.
Nice and cool now.
And my scarf is keeping me warm.
Ooh, hello!
Who's that?
Ha ha. It's you.
Me? What's this?
That's your snout. All pigs have snouts.
Hey, that's cold.
Ha ha. Oh, what are these?
Your ears. All pigs have ears.
Ha ha. I like my ears.
I like all of you.
What's it like being made of snow?
Cool!
I'd be cold all the time if I was made of snow.
I like being cold and there's lots to do.
I'll show you.
Aha!
Ha ha ha.
Brr! That's really cold.
Come back, snow pig.
Hey hey!
Ooh!
A snowflake.
Isn't it beautiful!
Where did it go?
It melted, Tiny. Wibbly's hand is too warm.
Brr. It's getting very cold now.
It might be time to go soon.
What about the Wibbly snow pig? He'll be lonely on his own.
We'll make him some new snow friends.
I'll make some heaps.
We'll make some snowballs.
Ho ho. Now I've got lots of friends.
Thank you, Wibbly and thank you, everyone.
Bye!
Brr! You're welcome. Now I really am freezing cold.
Time to go inside.
Me too. Bye, Wibbly.
Bye!
