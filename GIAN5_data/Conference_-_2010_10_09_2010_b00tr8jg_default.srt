must be some word today from my Centre. It is part of the
University complex. There is a cinema to one side, and theatre,
the conference hall, and there is a coffee shop just behind here. It
all adds to the atmosphere. Von Roderick is joining me in the
studio.    Vaughan. We have also assembled a support network of
people who can help me through this difficult next couple of hours.
Starting with, first and foremost, in a hall, John Stephenson.
Welcome indeed to the hall at the Arts Centre in Aberystwyth. Five
months since the last election. Eight months until the Assembly
election. A highlight of the afternoon here in the hall is the
speech of the party leader, Ieuan Wyn Jones.
We will bring you that speech live as and when it happens. We will
also be whisking him away from the conference hall as soon as we can
to sit here in the studio and answer some questions. Also helping
us, with a licence to roam, Mark Kennedy.
I am just opposite the cafe. There is quite a buoyant mood at this
conference. Perhaps that is understandable. Plaid Cymru is very
proud of what it is achieving in Government. In particular Ieuan Wyn
Jones with his economic programme. They have some tremendous
challenges ahead. They have just come on the back of a general
election in which they did not do as well as they would have hoped.
They will have to work out how to get from here to the next election,
whilst manoeuvring around the referendum on further powers, and
delivering some very unpopular cuts. How well they did that? The man who
may have the answer, the leader, Ieuan Wyn Jones, we are waiting to
hear him speak. Thank you, Mark. The next couple of
hours will fly a dive.    fly drive. Vaughan Roderick joins me. You have
been at the conference since yesterday. His mark right to say it
is a party in buoyant mood?    is Mark Wright? It is in buoyant mood.
the Liberal Democrats in the general election. They were
disappointed with that. And very bitter about the leadership debate,
which they blamed. Since then, the party has had a rethink. They have
thought, a lot of what went wrong in the general election was not the
fault of the leadership debate, it was a strategic. They also think
that things that have happened since then have worked in their
favour. First of all, the deal between the Lib Dems and the
Conservatives in Westminster, they think that will make the next
Assembly elections difficult for the Lib Dems. Around the country
there have been interesting things happening. When we heard from John
in a hall, we saw run Davies, the former Secretary of State for Wales,
on the stage.    run Davies. He will be standing for Plaid Cymru in
Caerphilly. He should be in with a chance. Not dead certain body
should be in with the chance. Plaid Cymru are seeing quite a few seats
they could win around the country. Adana think anybody thinks Plaid
Cymru is heading for a brilliant here next year, both they think it
is an election where they can make progress.    but they think.
party has changed a lot. It is the part of a coalition Government in
the Assembly for the past few years. How is that feeding into the way
the party is? It is a much more mature party in terms of how the
conference is run. There was an element of student debating society
about conferences in the past. Some of that remains. There was an
embarrassing amendment passed this morning calling on the Government
to abandon subsidising the north Wales, South Wales air service.
That is one of Ieuan Wyn Jones's great achievement. That will be
thrown at them by the Liberal Democrats. There are still the only
bit.    the one really bits. Always likely to go off script. However,
it does look like a serious party with the serious programme for
Government. It is trying to show itself as a serious alternative to
the party it is in Government with? Yes. That is the difficulty when it
comes to next year's election. They have seats where they can make the
tactical picture. Vogue plight, if you want the Tories out.    vote
Plaid Cymru. We have plenty of time to talk
about these matters. We are going to go through the conference hall
to hear from the Rural Affairs Minister. And John Stephenson is
there. Elin Jones the local Assembly
Member here. She is the rural affairs minister in the coalition
Government. The Liberal Democrats Hammad Plaid Cymru in the general
election.    hammered. He notes that Aberystwyth has had
considerable advantages over other coastal seaside towns. There are
considerable public sector employers. The dangers are the
public sector cuts and their impact on the town. Is the same message
that the owner of a delicatessen told me recently.    it is. The
recession last year did not have a considerable impact on his business,
but he was afraid of the public sector cuts because there would be
fewer public sector workers shopping around the town. This is
more dependent on public sector employment than any other area of
Wales. George Osborne has been allowed to realise his dream of
cutting the size of the public sector quickly and sharply. Yes,
the debt does need to be repaid. Public expenditure does need to be
cut. But George Osborne's rush to do this belongs more to political
dogma than prudent economic management. The Liberal Democrats
now are answerable for their words and actions. They try to denied
responsibility.    denied. But when Vince Cable announces cuts on a
scientific research, and when it is the funding of university
departments here who will lose out on money and opportunities, the
Liberal Democrat MP better not bark at Gordon Brown. It is the Lib Dems
to have allowed this rush and size of George Osborne Scott smack.
Without their vote with this would not have been possible. It is
The Government of Wales will have to cut budgets over the next few
months and some will be in the name of Plaid Cymru and the Wales
Government. It is the size of the cuts that will be our
responsibility. We have the fiscal flexibility to repay debt in Wales.
But we shall have the priorities. We shall need to be honest and
transparent. And we shall need to accept it is not going to be
possible to safeguard every bird, every hospital bed, built every
bypass. These last days of the wares Government will be a
challenge. They will be busy days. Before the election, there will be
the referendum on the powers of the Assembly. Although I was the only
non  6th form or in a comprehensive school in 1979, I have almost no
memory of the campaign. I can only presume I was pretty traumatised by
the result, because in the months following the referendum I became a
communist and a vegetarian! For the record, I am neither go longer! In
the three referenda, I voted no twice and yes, once. Hopefully it
will not be too difficult for you to guess when I've voted yes. The
other two Volz may be more challenging.    votes. In 1989 I've
voted in the could begin a referendum on the opening of's on a
Sunday.    of pubs. I've voted no. Therein lies the complexity of
voting patterns in the referendum. People can have a strange or
unexpected reason for her voting in a particular way. In 2004 I voted
no again. In that campaign people were confused as to why they needed
to be a change and what that change should be.    there needed to be a
change. If people are not sure, they will vote to keep the status
quo. We could be called the Switzerland of Wales. The Swiss
seem to have a referendum Maugham     on almost everything. Earlier
this year they are voted against a proposal to introduce a national
system of state funded lawyers to provide legal representation to
individual animals in court. The referendum arrows at of publicity
over a fishermen taking too long to on Hawk a pike. I have had my share
of legal challenge this year. But the prospect of every cow and
Badger in Wales having state funded legal representation to
individually challenge Government...
That would probably have led me to vote no once again. Next year's
Wales referendum result cannot be taken for granted. We cannot sit
back on a cosy political consensus and hope that people will vote yes.
We may be very clear why a yes vote is necessary. But people may be
tempted to vote no for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do
with legislative powers. We have to get out to work in the yes campaign.
This referendum was never Plaid Cymru's idea. It was Peter Hain's
idea. All of us need to do our a share of the work. Wales can be a
better place with our on Parliament. Anybody who has followed Plaid
Cymru in the last decade will know that we have spent a lot of time
talking about the need for a legislative parliament for Wales,
and a fair funding allocations to Wells.    funding allocation to
Wales. According to other parties, we were naive and they were the
ones protecting workers' interests. How wrong they were. In a Plaid
Cymru minority debate in 2001 in the Assembly, Nick Vaughan said
that to call for a review of the Barnett formula was folly. It is
probably only a Tory who would use the word folly. What he said was, a
review could result in the decline in the standard of public services
in Wales and business fleeing. The one problem, he said, that would be
solved by a review of Barnet would be that hospital waiting lists
would go down because people would move to England. Slightly less
hysterically, Sue Essex, the finance minister, said in 2003,
quoting again, it is our view that the Barnett formula, although we
all know the problems with it, gives Wales a fair deal. 10 years
on and Nick von is now saying the Barnett formula needs to be
reviewed.    Nick Vaughan. The current Labour Finance Minister
cannot repeat that often enough. Authority Labour and Tory members
want a new funding formula. They have made their journey along the A
470 to Damascus. To defer to the Lib Dems, and that is a sentence
you did not expect me to say, they have talked about a Barnet review
and a full Parliament for some time. They did nothing to deliver on that.
Plus she might not be pursuing reform in the coalition.    they
are not pursuing reform. They do not have a good record of sticking
to their principles in Government. Their MPs have voted for Trident,
VAT increase, and the rush to cut the public sector. Plaid Cymru in
Government will deliver a referendum for a legislative
parliament and has provided the incontrovertible case of the
unfairness of the UK Treasury We do not expect commentators or
journalists to commend us and our success and tenacity in winning
these arguments and starting to deliver change. However, I did not
expect commentators to start getting excited, on the weather
Plaid Cymru had lost its purpose, because we had achieved consensus
on two major campaigns. The fashionable phrase at the moment is
that Plaid Cymru is in trouble because Carwyn Jones has parked his
tank on our long. Well, it might be on our lawn and we welcome those
who are converts to the cause, but Plaid Cymru does not only have a
long, we have a field, a country. Our ambition for Wales isn't
confined to a long, not confined to a review of the Barnett formula and
a referendum on Part 4. Our ambition is to use the tools of
democracy and self government to change wills for the better. That
is why a yes vote in the referendum is important next year, so if Plaid
Cymru is in that Parliament's first government, we can put new
legislation policy into players that can change our fortunes. We
have been building our nation's democracy over the last 10 years
and over the next 10 years we need to focus on building the economy.
We need to lessen our economic dependence and to realise the
assets that we have in Wales. The Welsh government is largest
landowner in Wales. We need to make more of returned from that land.
The renewable energy potential is significant. You could write
mobile phone masts and solve coverage deficiency. We could
allocate more land for affordable housing and community food
production. Water is as valuable an asset to us as land. It is a
scandal that Welsh government does not have the powers over the water
resources in Wales, just as we don't for Energy Regeneration over
50 megawatts. Wales isn't a nation if we do not have charge of our
seas, land and water. No Ryder Cup or rugby success can gloss over
this deficiencies when we do not control our natural assets.   .
Governments and large businesses over the world are buying up land
in foreign parts in order to secure a water supply and the food supply
for the people. In Wales, we don't even control or own supply. ABBA
greatest asset is the people. We want our people to aspire to a
better future for themselves and their families in Wales. We have
had over 100 years of people's aspirations being linked to living
wills. It is in our Psyche that you do not really do well unless you go
to university in England or Scotland or you have been working
in London or your daughter is a hospital consultant in Birmingham.
But you can do well in Wales and it's just as good and better for
the committees and four wheels. People should have all the
opportunities to realise all of their trains in Wales when they so
choose. That is our aspiration for the people. That is why our
manifesto for next year's election will be our most ambitious and
aspirational. That is why a referendum on the Holtham
Commission are not enough. They might be for Carwyn Jones but they
are not enough for Plaid Cymru. That is why they were so much more
for us still to do. Why there is. That was a rural affairs minister
talking to delegates here at the annual conference in Aberystwyth.
Dylan Jones is always popular with delegates. She was spoken as a
future leader? It is something of a tradition that the party leader is
introduced by one of the local representatives, depending on
whether conferences but I think there is a greater significance in
the fact that she was given quite a lengthy slot. And she spoke largely
in English and give a speech that went far wider than just rural
affairs. You must remember the situation, Elwyn Jones Willie Plaid
Cymru into the next election and most people think he will step
aside during the next four years, he will not lead us into the
election in 2015. Who will replace him? The word was it could be Adam
Price, switching from Westminster. He isn't standing in 2011 so it
looks like they might have to look for someone else and the favourite
being discussed, and there are others, it is Alan Jones. She is
seen as a warm, safe, attractive personality who can appeal to rural
supporters but also can go wider. It was interesting that she pressed
all the right buttons, talked about constitutional matters, referenda
and things to do with nationhood. And put them into the context of
what those things could do for people, rather than in some
romantic he is? That is right. will hear that in a few minutes.
Plaid Cymru are very aware of the danger of being seen to be obsessed
about the constitution. Without explaining why they believe those
things are important. The same problem the Lib Dems have with the
voting system. This is important because of what it does. That was a
very interesting passage in the speech. As was the use of humour.
There are not many politicians who can sustain action restricting like
that. Rhodri Morgan was very good at that but there are not that many
in Wales you can do that. The A 470 road to Damascus! Thank you. Mark
Tami's job is to speak to delegates. Traumatised is too far but
surprised at the idea that Welsh politics can still upset somebody
so much that they would become a vegetarian and a communist. I were
not asked my guests whether they have any skeletons in the political
cupboards. I am joined by two real movers and shakers. The director of
policy, Nerys Evans, and Dafydd Trystan Davies. What you want to
hear from your leaders? Celebrating 10 years of devolution, the other
political parties are in our territory in terms of wanting the
yes vote on the referendum and fair funding so we need to look to the
next step and then hoping to hair have a can accomplish that and
transform Wales using the powers that we acquire from the referendum
to get a proper Parliament to transform the economic, health and
aspirational elements. You talk about that being after the next
election. You have got a heck of a job up to then? You wanna get these
powers are automatically, he will not do well automatically. How are
you going to get there? We have to present a positive vision and ask
the people to vote for us. We are looking to increase the number of
ministers who hope to be a part of the Government. It is to put that
vision out because if the status quo isn't an option, we need to put
an alternative vision to the people of Wales. Would you except it's a
difficult road to that election? Delivering these cuts will not be
easy for Plaid Cymru? Delivering cuts will not be easy but to set
out the clear vision of the kind of Wales we want to see in 20 years,
because that is the contrast between Plaid Cymru and Labour. I
want to see the fight being taken to the Labour Party, yesterday as
party fighting yesterday's battle with yesterday's ideas with Plaid
Cymru setting a clear vision for the future. And in that first
election, to the legislative assembly in Wales, more people will
look seriously at Plaid Cymru and if we can offer that vision, we can
make a major step forward in 2011. What is the best way to distinguish
a cells? Labour will lay claim to the same successors and some people
might be more ready to hear it for themselves. The critical thing is
to marry pride in our achievements and what we have achieved with a
great team of ministers and what you want for the future, what are
we going to do to the people who have poor late    life chances,
facing ill health, what can we offer them to improve their schools
and hospitals and job prospects and if we can put that Attracta vision
to them, it will really make a difference and people will vote.
Nerys Evans, one of your many jobs is to develop a policy for the
future. What do you think Keady is our that are coming through that
will regret the electorate? lodged a discussion document
yesterday with key policies on health, education and environment
to create a model for renewal energy and a not for profit company
and to be trilingual. What kind of rules to be one to be living in in
20 years? And putting the building blocks in place. We are quite close
to hearing from a dealer. Thank you both very much for joining me. We
are waiting to hear what Mr Jones has to say. Thank you very much.
You're watching the live coverage of Plaid Cymru's annual conference.
We are in the arts centre. We are working away up to the leader's
speech, what do we know of what he is likely to be saying? We should
say, it is a tale of two Jones. Ellen Jones uses humour but the
leader isn't a natural speaker and it's clear he does not enjoy these
occasions, he has tried different formats, walking around the stage
and none of them Dirty Work but Plaid Cymru have gotten used to
that, they see him as being a competent leader who is organising
the party well and he has been a competent Deputy First Minister.
They will forgive him for that. For the speech to work, it really has
to have substance in it. He cannot get away with rhetoric and he
cannot do rhetoric. Some will be ritualistic and we can predict a
lengthy attack on the Westminster government. The more interesting
parts will be how he begins to distance himself from Labour, the
party he is in government with. There are some ways to do that,
attacking the record of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in Westminster.
But how does he attacked or criticise and distance himself from
the people he works with on a day  to day basis. He has not had to do
that before. He has to begin now. You welcome back to you in one
minute. More views with Mark... Somebody else who things far too
much about these things? I have Daran Hill. How does Ieuan Wyn
Jones distinguish his party from Labour? By promoting distinctive
policies and having a clear platform and grasping the radical
edge that the opposition gives it that you lose in government, they
have to do a transition and the government and opposition over the
coming six months. It will be difficult to put off, they made a
strong start yesterday, will he carry the    carry this through?
it more difficult than some delegates realise? When you are in
government you lose that radical edge, you focus on covering and
delivering the existing programme rather than coming up with
inspirational ideas. It is hard to square. And Plaid Cymru has no
experience of doing this before. They have to change the mindset and
I don't think the delegates have grasped what a big challenge that
is. Have you got any head of the kind of vision Mr Jones might set
out? We had a major speech from 10 a month ago on broadcasting and it
will be about devolving particular areas and applying them in terms of
policy, how that additional devolution would lead to a material
difference to everyday lives. you. We're still waiting... Not for
much longer. Within the next minute we will hear from the leader. He
has to get the party onto election fitting? And what all parties are
doing is they get party political broadcasts on television at the
time of these conferences and to build the leaders is they play them
on their screens. We will not let people see this party election
broadcast twice! But Ieuan Wyn Jones will be preparing his speech,
which follows a clear pattern, he begins in March, goes for about
one third of the speech and Welsh and switches into English. If
people are listening to the translation, it will not be all the
way through, it will switch. Isn't it important to reach out to
different audiences? Welsh, English and the people in the hall and
voters at home? The people watching this programme but also you must
bury in a little paragraphs for the news programmes, Wales Today and
good morning wills. The speeches have to be carefully crafted. One
little tip I have heard is that one of the things they're eager to do
is ensure that when that language spent comes, there is a huge
cheers! There is an easy way... That is by welcoming Ron Davies to
the stage! I will put some money on the last words before the language
which as being Davis and Ron! Run Davies is far more loved than
the has been for a long time in this party.    Ron Davies.
Welcome back into the hall. Ieuan Wyn Jones, without a jacket, walks
onto the podium at to a standing ovation. He is not a humorous,
Thank you very much for the welcome. Of course, I would
like to thank Aberystwyth for offering a home to the party
conference once again. For those of you old enough to remember, it was
in Aberystwyth that I made my first ever conference speech. And that
was in the days of the old King's Hall. I am sure there are the
number of you in the audience who remember the days of the King's
Hall. And of course, Aberystwyth plays a very important part in the
life of the nation. University, the library, the National Library. And
by the way, there was a choice and it was decided to establish the
National Library, and it was a choice between Aberystwyth and
Cardiff. I am very pleased that Aberystwyth 1.    one. By now of
course the National Library is being steered by Dafydd Begley. And
last year of course, we established a regional officer for the National
Assembly here in Aberystwyth, which is part of the process of
decentralising the chosen functions across Wales. There is extremely
important research work of a scientific nature being done here.
The contribution of this is very significant and we as the party
will continue to support them. And of course, we appreciate the great
work of Elin Jones as local Assembly Member.
And her important work as the
Minister for Rural Affairs of the Wales Government. I know that the
work that you have done is being acknowledged by the people of
Caribbean and will be at the next election. It is 10 years this year
that I had the privilege of being collected. That was as leader of
the party. That was the year after establishing the Assembly. When
somebody looks back over that period, we all realise how much has
changed here in Wales. Wales has gained since the Stabler sing the
National Assembly.    establishing. It falls short of the aspirations
of a party for the future of Wales. But it has been an important forum
and a national stage for us. So much so that the majority of the
people of Wales see it as the place where the important decisions, the
important policy decisions, should be made that affect our lives. It
is not just a administrating our country. That is not just our
mission. We want to transform Wales. We can announce with pride that we
are now starting the work of preparing to win the referendum,
and to put Plaid Cymru's policies, to make them implemented in the
first term of our new legislative parliament. By now there is a clear,
an increasingly clear majority, that believes Wales and the
Assembly should have more powers. So we were right, weren't we, to
ensure the commitment to increased legislative powers as part of the
agreement for Wales? Yes, Wales and the Assembly have grown in maturity.
They have become a far more confident nation.    it has become
a far more confident nation. And Plaid Cymru in that the same way.
The people in Wales can trust in Plaid Cymru. Not only as we have
always done, to place Wales first every time, but also to implement
for the benefit of the people of Wales in Government. Wales has
gained, has profited from having four ministers from Plaid Cymru as
a part of the Government of Wales, doing and making a great difference
to the people of Wales wherever they may be. We have responded to
every challenge, I think. We have been particularly successful as a
party. There is another challenge facing us. We have been part of a
Government. Now our next challenge is to lead a Government. And a
challenge for me personally is to become the First Minister and the
first of    the first member of Plaid Cymru to become the First
And for the first time, of course, since devolution, it is a
Government of a completely different colour in Westminster to
what we have in Cardiff. When the coalition was formed in London
between the Tories and the Lib Dems, we knew at worst that this would be
one of the most important challenges facing the new democracy
we have in Wales. Some would argue, and I am sure there is a truth in
that the allegation, that the way the Tories governed Wales between
1979 and 1997, was the reason that many people voted yes at the last
referendum. Do you remember? It appears that the clearest picture
in people's minds of that very bleak period was John Redwood's
attempts to sing the anthem. But the reality is, the situation was
far worse than that. Do you remember? Unemployment sharp up to
more than 13%.    shot up. Severe harsh cuts in public services,
communities being destroyed, taken to pieces. And the massive fight to
establish... A question. Have the Tories learnt anything? The first
days of the coalition did not augur well. Where Scart won a secretary
prostate who actually represented the constituency in Wales.    Wales.
David Cameron appointed somebody from Buckinghamshire to serve Wales
in the Cabinet. What about their policies on education and health?
Is as if nothing has changed since the days of Margaret Thatcher.   
it is as safe. They are the same Tories as ever and they have
learned nothing about Wales. What were they doing for 13 years in
opposition? Did they not learn anything? They have numbers   
members in the Assembly. Did they not talk to them? We will see
exactly what they offer Wales when the spending review, public 
spending review, is announced on 20th October. We expect about £5
billion will be cut from the Welsh budget between now and 2015. I know
it is very difficult to take that figure in. So, repeated. Between
now and 2015, we expect there will be cuts of 5 billion in with the
Welsh budget. If you make cuts of that level, there is no way that
you can save every service. It is just not possible. Of course there
is room for savings in an Emap public body. The Government of
Wales has consistently look for savings. But when you cut so much
of the budgets, there will be no way you can do that without
affecting services to people who need them most. We have no way of
knowing what those cuts will be until October, but we know the
Tories want to cut more, deeper and faster than the spree. And they do
this, as we know, for a purely ideological reasons. With the
intention of reducing the state. Without considering the cost to
public services. Whatever George Osborne would say or do, it would
be impossible for Renault Government in Wales not to cut back
on the health service.    any Government in Wales. That is a very
serious thing to have to acknowledge when you remember that
40% of our money goes towards the health service. If we just saved
the health service, the cuts on other services would be enormous.
It means possibly that some departments have to disappear
completely, and we cannot do that. So the big question, therefore, is
not will there be a cut in the health service or the education
budget, but how much less well the cuts B of there?    will have the
courts be? It is the intention applied Comrie    Plaid Cymru to
ensure that we did defend as best we can expenditure on hospitals,
schools and those very necessary services people rely on. We will
not permit the axe of the Government in London to kill ho
macro spirits or Al macro ambitions for our country and its people.   
to kill our spirits or our country. We can be very proud of what has
been achieved in the Government. We have saved services in hospitals
across Wales. And we have abolished that internal market in the health
service. We have introduced the foundation FA's year macro primary
schools.    the Foundation phase in our primary schools. We have made a
great start on improving transport links between North and South. And
we have seen a change in the the way we support business. We have
built more affordable houses and ensured... In the face of the
vicious opposition from London. And we have supported the agriculture
and food sector, so important to a thriving rural Wales. The work of
the party in this Government is not yet over. During the year that is
left of this Government, there will be new laws. And it missed those, I
will be introducing a Bill to ensure the safety of our children
as they travel to school. Abigail at last that will insure more
affordable housing in our communities.    and Bill. It will
make a clear statement comes down     concerning the official status of
a Welsh in Wales. Yes. Yes, Plaid Cymru and our heritage minister are
of listening and implementing. We will have created a Language Bill
that will lead for the first time water companies, post, gas,
telecommunications companies, and hundreds of public bodies, all to
provide Welsh services. There will be a language Commissioner with a
strong advocate for Wells to supervise the whole lot. But
friends, we need to do far more. We need to ensure that the Government
and every Olga macro sector in Wales increases the number of Welsh
Increase the use of Welsh. And, of course, to protect Welsh as a
living language in our community. Today, Plaid Cymru is committed to
ensuring a new strategy for the language with new ideas are and in
the first term of our new Parliament, we will insure you
resources in order to get to grips with the challenge that faces us.
The people of Wales can be very proud of Plaid Cymru's record in
government. Delivering and, from time to time, willing to make
difficult decisions. But protecting the record isn't enough. There was
a need for the people of Wales to know not only were we stand on the
big issues of the day, what hour record was in government, but what
you will do in government after the next election. In spite of the cuts,
we wish to put a priority on the necessary services, that will
include the budgets for hospitals, schools, are vulnerable, elderly,
services for children's schools and chilling. What can we do depends on
the spending review. But at least the people of Wales will know what
our priorities are. Once again, we have seen the Tories threatening to
destroy communities and an eagerness to experiment with their
radiology. They will not be allowed to do that in Wales. As we face
cuts in public expenditure, it isn't Plaid Cymru's job to defend
those institutions who had plans that were created by the Labour
Party. Without thinking about their purpose and effectiveness. It isn't
our work either to do the Tories Dirty Work in Wales. We can leave
that to the Lib Dems. Plaid Cymru's work and purpose is to ship
ammunition has to come out of recession. And our vision is
sharper than ever before. And our eagerness to build a future has not
diminished. People ask us, what can you do? Under these very difficult
circumstances. One thing we can do is to make sure that there is money
available for community assets within the local government Budget.
For example, ask departments in the public sector to use assets like
schools in order to deliver comprehensive services in our
communities. Don't look at buildings are just deliver
educational services, use our assets in a far more pioneering way.
As well as that, along with legislative powers, there is a need
for the Assembly to take responsibility for more things that
affect us as people. And one field and can think of his broadcasting.
Did you see those programmes that those three British leaders during
the election? There wasn't much to differ between them apart from the
colour of the ties. The future of S4C is a public subject. It is a
very important issue in Wells. But the assembly in Wales has no voice
at all in that debate in developing a new vision. I would like to make
this clear   Plaid Cymru will not be willing to see any cuts for S4C.
An Act of Parliament insured the Budget for us was not at the whim
of any government and that is for good reasons. But as we will see,
we can't stay still at the. S4C has to accept there is a challenge in
the digital age. And there is a need for the BBC in London to
realise that the needs of broadcasting in Wales are a lot
different to the needs of the south east of England. It is
totally unacceptable that the BBC has reduced the number of
programmes about Wales through the medium of English, they have fallen
dramatically over the last few years and it is worse that the
corporation refuses to commit to strengthen the situation for the
future. But in decentralising broadcasting, and that's only if we
get a favourable settlement, then we can develop the creative
industries and make better use of the £300 billion that is available
to spend. And I can say this   in promoting it properly, the creative
industry sector and all the industries with then make a massive
contribution to the culture and economy of Wales. Next year, there
will be a referendum on additional powers. We have agreed on the
question and the preparations are already underway. But let no one
think that winning a referendum is going to be easy. The opinion polls
will go very well. When support for the yes vote rising regularly. But
there is nothing certain in the world of the referendum and we will
need a very powerful and strong campaign, United and full of
purpose to ensure victory. There will be more details about the
organisation of the campaign coming out soon and I know that members of
Plaid Cymru will be willing to help with this cross party campaign to
ensure that the Yes votes deliver home. Friends, this time it is
wonderful to know that the architect of that first measure of
devolution, Ron Davies, is now a member of Plaid Cymru! I was a bit
worried about the length of that! He told me, you don't
have to worry. In the 11 years since devolution, Wales is a much
more mature, confident nation. And many of the NT is that Plaid Cymru
has championed over the years are now adopted as mainstream. It was
Plaid Cymru that they should be had a referendum, as we heard, on
further powers. We were right to do that. Now if we have all the
parties in the assembly agreeing with us. When the assembly was
established, and I'm sure people like Dafydd will remember this,
Plaid Cymru was very much the lone voice in saying that the way Wales
was being funded was not fair and needed to be changed. Be insisted
that any formal or on funding Wales should be based on it needs. Both
the Tories and Labour Party in Wales defended the current system
and accused us of putting Welsh money at risk because they said any
change would disadvantage us. We were right to insist that things
had to change. So right that it is now hard to find any single
Assembly member from any party that disagrees. How things have changed.
And we have the Holtham Commission. Publishing what is now regarded as
the most comprehensive, well argued and soundly researched report ever
produced in the UK on this topic. And it unequivocally says, Wales
has been unfairly treated by the Barnett Formula. So, we were right
all along. Of course we were. We have always put the interests of
Will's first. But we are pleased that something that Plaid Cymru has
long argued for his night at the heart of the political debate in
Wales. When most people in Wales are calling for fair funding, Plaid
Cymru once again are leading the debate. Surely, there is no better
time to argue for fair funding in Wales than when the axe is about to
fall on public services. In a way we have not seen for one generation.
We remember the last time the Tories we love that public spending
axe. This isn't just about cutting back on spending as a result of the
banking crisis, let us remember, the Tories always seem to want to
cut with relish. Cutting back on state spending, it isn't just about
getting public finances back on track for them. It is an article of
faith for the Tories. Never mind to sufferers when that axe falls. The
Welsh communities are still bearing the scars of the Thatcher years.
Tearing the heart out of our communities. Destroying our social
fabric. Communities bonded together through decades of coal and steel,
left to fend for themselves as support mechanisms were ripped
apart. But then, of course, we had nothing to defend ourselves against
a Tory onslaught. We had not voted Tory in any of the three Tory
landslide victories in the 1970s and 80s, yet they were fiercely
thrust their policies down our throats. Remember? GP fundholding
practices? Introducing the internal markets in the NHS? Grant 
maintained schools? 13 years later, have they changed? I will ask
again... Have they changed? I want to be fair to the fact that the
Secretary of State for Wales is an MP representing a constituency in
Buckinghamshire. What sort of recommendation is that for somebody
to represent Wales around the Cabinet table? But the wording of
their coalition document makes interesting reading. It makes
hardly any reference to Wells. In that first document they produced.
Then they produced another. They thought, we had better say
something about Wales. So, what they said, and "... Depending on
the outcome of the forthcoming referendum, we will establish a
process similar to the Calman Commission for the Welsh Assembly.
What does that sound like to you? Yes, they recognised the strength
of feeling in Wales on the issue. But they have no plans whatsoever
to set up a fair funding formula for Wales, all they want to do is
set up another committee. Our message is this... There is no need
for any new committee, Mr Cameron, just get on with it and establish a
fair funding system! And, of course, the Labour Party cannot escape its
responsibility in this area. Remember, they had 13 years to
change the formal. They did absolutely nothing. And in the days
before the election, they actually said, they would keep the former
because it works. Works for him? Peter Hain said that Wales would
not be disadvantaged. Well, we are disadvantaged in the short term of
up to £300 million. Muster may have won the argument, a monster parties
in the assembly, I still do not see much movement at the other end.   
a amongst the parties. I have no doubt that the argument has been
one. What we now need is the political will to deliver. Whatever
arguments we have one, whatever we have delivered in government during
the last three or so years, the people of Wales also have the right
to know what we will do in government after 2011. During what
everybody recognises will be the bleakest sustained period for
public spending for 70 years. Our message will be that, for the sake
of wills, Plaid Cymru will continue to be impatient for change.
Managing Wales may not be what the other parties are about but for
Plaid Cymru, putting up with things as they are it does not feel right.
We will not sit back and allow the Tories and the Lib Dems to hold our
We will not allow them to wear us down, to Sat our Energy, or and
Misha our determination to realise a more confident and prosperous and
Faro Wales.    more fair Wales. For 13 years the Labour Party Bill's
new projects and structures as a response to those problems.   
built. Few of them succeeded. Now the Tories and the limp    Lib Dems
want to strip away support for the poorest. Their Peps are not our
Peps. Plaid Cymru is a different animal. The only party for Wales
and Wales alone. And in a time of scarce resources, we will act to
build this nation according to our needs, not their demands. We are
ambitious for Wales. Our aspirations for Wales was set a
high standard. We want everybody to have the opportunity to develop
their full potential, as well as making sure the weak and vulnerable
are properly looked after through good quality public services. This
is what a modern left a party    left of centre party should be
about. Aspiration for our people and our nation, as well as making
sure the less well off are cared for.
Let's put this into context. For
the Tories, aspiration is about individual wealth, getting on at
all costs. For Labour, aspiration became a meaningless as it sold its
soul to    sold to vested interests and stood shoulder to shoulder with
George Bush.    sold its soul. For Plaid Cymru, aspiration is about
the best we can possibly get for our nation and its people. We want
people to get the best because Wales deserves the best. Let's be
honest, Labour's rhetoric about eradicating poverty, child poverty
in particular, fell well short of its delivery. We now live in or
less equal society than when they came to power. Labour fuelled the
boom in consumerism leading tour unsustainable personal debt levels,
and a housing boom that trapped people with unrealistic mortgage
repayments. They allowed the banks to lend beyond people's ability to
pay, and saddled many young families with debts they cannot
simply repay. Do you remember Gordon Brown's mantra? Prudence
with a purpose. He left offers with many people saddled with debt. Debt
is the worst poverty. I have already said Howard our priorities.
Spending on hospitals and schools, frail old people, children, skills
and training. I would now like to talk a little bit about what we
would do in specific key areas. In the summer I set out a new
programme for the economy. Economic recovery, a new direction. It
really is a scandal that so many young people are leaving school
without qualifications. Many people unable to read and write, and to
hold down a job. Things have to change. Within a generation we want
Wales to become a country that has left higher unemployment and
economic inactivity behind. We want to create jobs, improve business
and improve prosperity. We need to expand our skills base. We want a
country with this desiccated Transport and digital
infrastructure.    a sophisticated transport and digital
infrastructure. An economy that is more self sufficient and the Wales
that does not have to depend on a European aid. I am ambitious for
the economy of Wales. My aspiration is that where it becomes one of the
best performing economies in Western Europe.    Wales becomes.
We want a country that has learnt to thrive within its fair share of
the environmental resources. Wales is well placed to be at the
forefront of our response to climate change. Living within our
means is not just about money. It is also about the planet. We have
wind, water and tidal resources. We have land to produce food and we
have the energy of our people. We can meet the challenge of climate
change and put up Wales at the cutting edge of humanities response.
   humanity's response. We will continue to invest in early years
education. We must look at the seven to 14 age group, making sure
we build on the success of early years. That way, teachers can
provide our young people with the best start in life. We want our
education system to be the success story of Wales. We want our
children to become grounded, independent thinking individuals,
with hunger for innovation and learning, and a deep understanding
of the society and world in which they live. We want our education
system to provide opportunity. And we want each child to focus and
developed their own personal interests, personalities and skills.
In health, we want to maintain good quality secondary care facilities,
with the availability of specialist services for harp, cancer and
strokes treatment within easy reach of patients.    heart. We will
introduce a new national vision for cancer services, with better co 
ordination and planning for individual patients. We will
improve survival rates. And also, the patient experience. And we will
save money. And I want to make one thing absolutely crystal clear. We
will not go down the English route of GP commissioning.
The conditions in which people live often impact on their health.
Investing in good quality affordable social housing is
vitally important. We will continue to develop the Housing Bond
initiative through a Welsh housing investment interest. In times of
economic stringency, this will reduce the pressure on the Welsh
Assembly put up and use a more innovative financial model to meet
the housing need. We can roll it out to other areas of capital spend.
One more word about housing. I mentioned earlier in the speech
about how long it took for us to get the powers in the Assembly. Yes,
of course, that does say something about the byes than time, outmoded,
long winded and patronising way we get our legislation from
Westminster. And it is one of the clearest examples of why we need a
parliament in Wales. I want to tell you something else. It tells you
something about the gods, the tenacity, and sheer determination
of Plaid Cymru ministers.    the got. After three long years we had
a final stand off. Jocelyn Davies, R housing minister, in the red
corner.    our Housing Minister. Coming out for the final round. The
fresh faced new boy, David Jones, in the blue corner demanding last 
minute changes. Conference, I would like to tell you, there was only
going to be one winner in that contest.
I have not quite finished. Instead
of coming out for the final round, David Jones said in his seat and
threw in the towel. In Jocelyn Davies, Wales has a true champion
in the housing sector. And we must also make more facilities available
for walking and cycling. We will promote the use of car free days
across Wales, starting in our sustainable trouble towns. I am
proud to be the first Welsh minister to be spending more on
integrated transport than on roads. In rural Wales, Elin Jones has
already achieved a great deal. But she also wants to do more. As
successful farming sector is essential to maintain the stability
of our wrote way of life and rural communities. We need a vibrant
communities. Vibrancy in Arab rural areas is characterised often buy
and network of tans.    is characterised often by a network of
pounds. They maintain the fabric of rural society. We are only eight
months away from that Assembly election. It wants to make our Case
For our vision of a better than Wales.    eight months. 34 weeks to
tell the people of Wales that they can rely on us to protect them
against the worst effects of the Tory cuts. 240 days for our
excellent candidates to visit homes, the length and breadth of Wales, to
explain that if you want a decent hospital, a good school, you want
to protect our fragile environment, provide good training for eye Young
People, they are ambitions of that only a voter for Plaid Cymru will
deliver. Wales has better Government if Plaid Cymru has at
the heart of that Government. You can trust us to work for Wales
every time. And the message I have is this. I did not come into
politics to manage Wales. I came into politics to change Wales. I
want to change Wales for the better. Our values, therefore, define a our
mission. Our sense of what Wales can achieve. Plaid Cymru always
puts Wales first. That means you and your family, you and your
community. And our message to the people of Wales is this. Join us
next May on this journey to create a better Wales. We really can do it.
If we do it together.
You Ieuan Wyn Jones getting the obligatory standing ovation.   
Ieuan Wyn Jones. He will never make it as a turn at the end of the pier.
He is a serious figure first serious times. That was Gordon
Brown's message in Westminster. Gordon Brown could not pull it off.
Will Ieuan Wyn Jones? We will have to wait until next May to find out
whether it works. The message to the delegates here in the main hall
of the Aberystwyth Arts Centre is the transformation of Wales. Back
to you, Adrian. Thank you, John. We were the year
to enjoy the applause for the party leader. Ieuan Wyn Jones speaking to
the party conference. You're watching our live coverage of the
conference. We will probably here a fair bit of noise as the delegates
leave the conference hall.    will probably here a fear that it nice.
There with us. It adds to the jollity of the location. Here in
our little corner I am joined by Vaughan Roderick, a Welsh Affairs
what editor. And who will Williams You bet me a few pence of there be
a massive cheer at the switch of language when Ron Davies was
mentioned, you only mentions some pence but I have used the Barnett
formula and that is fair! 15p? Don't say another word. They say
Ron Davies as being at crucial weapon. He plays a pivotal role?
I'm not sure, with in Caerphilly he is but I think Plaid Cymru and Ron
Davies have had a long, long flirtation. For voters outside
Plaid Cymru, I do not think he may be has the same status. Were the
same sort of appeal that Plaid Cymru thinks. Within the hall, that
worked well, that language transition is a difficult thing,
you want to hear cheering and that was the best way. The performance
as a speaker, you can hear the noise outside, we talked about that
beforehand. Did you see that becoming a reality? He has done it
and Nick Clegg. He can be a bit stiff behind the podium. No jacket?
There was need in that speech. What came close to an announcement in
the Welsh part was the core part of the Welsh speaking vote. A lot of
concern that the Welsh language measure proposed in the assembly
does not have a clause Four States baldly that Welsh and English are
the official languages of Wales. The Plaid Cymru minister has been
standing against that although he said he would listen. There was a
clear message from Ieuan Wyn Jones that when it reaches the assembly,
it will include that clause. Plaid Cymru feel the need that as well as
reaching out, they need to shore up that constituency. There have been
some problems. Let's be blunt. They promised a Welsh language in a
paper. What came was a website. They have been looking after
sections of their core constituency and that was obviously targeted at
that. You are about as corner as they get. In that speech do the job
for you? It is always an important part of the political cycle?
thought it was a very positive speech. He outlined a great number
of policy points. He was not whingeing for Wales, the
acquisition about Plaid Cymru is that we do that. We can leave that
to the Labour Party. He seemed to be enjoying that. That was a
positive speech. With a clear vision. There was some negativity,
Tory bashing, the complaint about unfair funding. And there was some
whingeing about the TV leadership did it?    did it. You must refer
to history. The presidential style debate. And we are now engaging
with the Tories, the Tories are going to be cutting the money that
we get in Wales and we are engaging positively with that struggle. With
some distinction, I would say, two other parties. We were talking
about this beforehand, it was a speech that is to set the party on
an election footing. Did it do that? I think so. The difficulty
with policy announcements is always, when you do then? If you do them
too early, other parties could copy them. Too late, there's a danger
the other parties will have come out first. A lot of these policies,
they don't come from close rooms of party members. They are ideas that
have been floated in the voluntary sector, floated by think tanks, so
which party runs with them is quite important. I think Plaid Cymru
might have missed something of a trickier. Yesterday, as part of
their ideas were launched, they did mention a raft of new policies. I
don't understand why they did not quote one or two of those new ideas,
like the use of schools for shops and community facilities, the free
postal library, one or two of us could have been held back for today.
What was new and innovative in the speech was the same stuff as
yesterday so there was an issue of management. As a senior party
figure, any explanation for that? Clearly we are on a path towards
selection via the referendum and they are making announcements and
we will be explaining our policies bit by bit. For the referendum and
then the election comes by. We have set our agenda clearly. It is a
positive agenda for Plaid Cymru and for Wales into the next election.
think that is interesting. In terms of what happened in the general
election. Immediately after the general election, if you talk to
Plaid Cymru, they were whingeing about the leaders' debate. Since
then, if you read the introduction to the conference handbook by John
Davis, John Dixon, rather, they say differently. It was not just that,
it was the fault of the party. The party got its organisation right.
It got the Campaign right. But they did not give any reason for people
to vote for them. And that obviously, it is like the whingeing
comment, that is what the message seems to have been. You cannot just
go negative. Is that right? It is a fair point about campaigning in the
past. But our policies are much more developed than they have been
over my career. I think we have a reasonable Ground Force of policies
that will stand us in good stead coming up to the election. Plaid
Cymru now looks like a government which possibly could lead
government whereas 15 years ago, it was aspiration but not reality.
Thank you both very much for bisecting the speech. Thank you for
joining us. In our little corner of the Arts Centre. Meanwhile, is
going to be noisy here. I expect were Mark is, it's even noisier.
am down a cross from the cafe. It is noisy but we will do our best to
communicate. I'm joined by the rising stars of Plaid Cymru. The
fan media this. They hope to stand. The let's see what they thought of
the speech. Helen, what did you take away? I think you can tell
that everyone is excited after that and what I took away is the Plaid
Cymru has a mission for the future and we are excited about the
challenges but the referendum and the assembly elections and we were
thinking about Wales. Also, he was very honest about the tough times
ahead. But we are looking beyond those times and how we can develop
Wales so that it is truly a great nation. Was there enough there to
distinguish Plaid Cymru's message from the Coalition partners?
Absolutely. 2011 was a big year.    is a big year, and with any win in
the election we will have the tools to do the job that we have been
hoping to have for many years. We are in very difficult times. And
the vision that the speech give for Wales was very important because we
need to be thinking about how we can be small, clever and prosperous
as a nation. And use our natural resources better because if we just
talk about the cutting and content ourselves with putting up with the
cuts, it will be the most vulnerable who suffer once again.
But we have to put up with those cuts? It's alright having plans,
but Plaid Cymru will have to deliver something really
unpleasant? Definitely, but what is exciting and what is different from
other politicians is that you want to do things differently, not just
a matter of cutting jobs here and there. But changing the way we
operate a the bee can deliver for the people. What particularly did
you like about this different ways? The ways in which we deliver health
and education, that be really think about radical ideas. Politicians
like to talk in soundbites. And they are guilty of having ad hoc
policies, but we now have radical new thinking on how to deliver
things differently. That is very exciting and I'm glad to be a
member. Anything among those radical ideas? We heard about bond
issues for housing, not going the decommissioning writ, what did you
lie? I liked the idea is about empowering people, providing better
services locally and as somebody who works for the NHS I was
interesting    interested to here that we won't be going down the NHS
writ. We also had a motion passed about the national social care
process for Wales. And that helps define the kind of country we want
to live in, but and five years but in 20 years. Isn't just about
short term political advantage, it's about building the nation.
housing bond issue, that is quite different from Plaid Cymru, a way
to address the shortage of funding that will be left in the centre?
is exciting policies like that that we are seeing progression in and
this new way of thinking. There are so many things to take away from
the speech and people want to read it and think about it and also the
launch of the vision yesterday, which is a discussion paper, that
is very exciting because we will be tackling those issues and thinking
about these ideas that are needed for Wales. There is always a danger
of preaching to the converted? You are proud of her achievements. You
know what you have done, you have to get that across to the public
and with a view ran what were perceived to be very good election
campaigns and for different reasons, you did not get a brick through.
What lessons have you learnt? would contest that we did not get a
good result, it also    it was our best ever result. And the majority
was 7000 at the outset. If that same number of people voted as
usually vote, he would have won, but the party that did you scare
tactics, they said they would capture benefits, and people were
extremely angry that it was precisely the Labour Party who
handed over the Government to the Lib Dems and the Conservatives
because they would not do a deal with progressive left of centre
parties. You will see what happens as Plaid Cymru resolves itself.
Back to you. I am joined by the leader of Plaid Cymru, Ieuan Wyn
Jones. Thank you for joining us. How did the speech go? Political
long time to prepare? It was a long time and preparation. It does take
time and then you refine and discuss it and plan it. And all
those things and then and that comes to the proof of the pudding,
whenever it was, minutes, in the conference hall, that is when the
reaction comes. And you have to remember, the speech will be heard
and seen by people outside the conference. To audiences, people
within the hall, and above their heads? In a sense. It is a
conference speech but you must remember the wider audience.
talked before you started and we were discussing the kind of things
we thought you needed today. You probably needed to set the party on
an election footing, didn't you? Was that uppermost in your mind?
Which parts do that? Two areas, the first was going into a little bit
of detail about the kind of policy initiatives we want to set out for
the election but also, it was perhaps above that, the whole issue
of ambition and aspiration. Taking wheels to the next stage of its
development and Plaid Cymru has always been a party that wants to
take Wales forward. As I made clear, but to manage the country but to
change it. A big part of the conference has been getting ideas
from party members. You would have expected to see a couple of those
ideas in there, whereas it was a party leader's ideas? Did you miss
a trick? No, we pick ideas from all sorts of places. What has been good
about Plaid Cymru recently as we have opened our doors and if you
have some interesting ideas, we will do so. One of the problems we
still face in Wales post devolution is we do not have a good policy 
making structure. We must build on that, that is one of the missing
links and Plaid Cymru has always done that but the other parties...
They talk the talk about getting ideas, how do you make that a
reality? What if they come up and something, because there was a
motion this morning that was embarrassing to have? I think, in a
sense there is a parameter. Within which policies have to fit. Within
your overall policy as a party. you control the ideas? We don't,
really, because it is a very wide church. We are prepared to look at
ideas. In a sense, I set the parameters, which is you want to be
aspirational for people and communities but we must remember
that there are parts of society which need our help. But within
that, there are lots of things to discuss and I mentioned some today.
As well as thinking about election, there is another important vote,
the referendum on further powers? Any clear idea on when that will be
held? We have not finally agreed a date so that will be something that
we will be sitting down over the next few weeks on and agreeing.
Because that needs to go into the order that is laid before
Parliament and the assembly. The need to agree the date but having
agreed that question,... question was embarrassing? We're
quite happy with the version that we came up with, the Electoral
Commission, everybody has signed up Do you think it is not just a
question of whether the people of Wales are ready for the change, but
be you think this is the right referendum?    de think? It is a
lot of stress or something that is not really a major step forward.
is a major step forward. It would mean the Assembly could make its
own laws without having to go Westminster. It is a very important
issue to us. The housing legislation is a case in point. It
was not our choice to have a referendum on this Top    topic. To
move the Assembly forward, we have to go through a process. It was the
quid pro quo of the coalition deal, wasn't it? It was one of the issues.
We did make it clear we want the referendum to be held. It is now
clear everybody wants it. Was it a mistake to make such a totem of
this particular a referendum giving the argy bargy you have had having
it delivered? Let's be honest, we had to one of and 40 odd
commitments    240. It was just one of the commitments. We had to
deliver on it. Two things have happened. We have now got
experience of the existing system. Having to go cap in hand to
Westminster, it is cumbersome, costly. Secondly, we now have a
Conservative and Liberal Democrat administration. We do not really
know how that is going to work out. Having clarity, making it
absolutely clear, it is important. Do you think that you as a party
and you as Deputy First Minister have to face two ways. You talk
about your aspirations for Wales. At the same time you talk about
unfair funding, changing the money that comes from London. It is
almost is if you were talking of one hand about standing on your own,
and there that a dependency culture in the other? I did make it clear I
wanted Wales to stand on its own. So we are not reliant on the money
coming from Europe. It is not a badge of honour to be qualified
twice and possibly three times for a European aid. We need to improve
things. It is also about the degree of fairness. Wales has not been
funded fairly. Let's get a funding formula that his affair. We you
indulge me if I speculate a bit about what will happen after the
election? Of course. We can assume there is quite likely to be a
coalition. Some things you said this week seemed to suggest any
pact with the Tories. Is that right? What they have said is that
would be difficult but the simple reason that the Conservatives and
Lib Dems are in coalition in Westminster. That makes it harder
for you? Let's be perfectly clear. We have a coalition. We will be in
coalition until the next Assembly election. We will be fighting the
election on the basis of independent parties. We will be
going to the electorate, independently, with our or
manifestos. But clearly because we have now got experience of
coalition in Wales, people are interested in what kind of
situation you might find yourself. It is only fair for people to know
the difficulties of the alternative, and what those difficulties are.
Can I put it more sense to have not been my head off yet? You're on a
future. We you need    lead the party into the election after this
one? Who knows? I did not knowing 2003. 2007 was the same. My
intention at the moment is to be fighting this election, making sure
Plaid Cymru does well. Thoughts about the future, we have to wait.
Circumstances change. As things stand my intention is to continue.
Thank you very much. Enjoy the rest of Europe conference.
Mark seems to be enjoying his conference.
I am down among the delegates again. A couple of people very interested
in hearing what Mr Jones at two here, Daran Hill. What did you make
of the tone of the speech? A liked the bit towards the end where he
contrasted his change and management. There have been a
number of accusations made at Plaid Cymru ministers that they have been
to miss    managerial. It was a speech that seemed to look towards
a new radicalism, albeit in mathematical way that I was all bad
   that was all about change. Perhaps more themes than specific
policy ideas? Yes. It is time that Plaid Cymru shows it can make the
change. Now showing we have greater ambitions for Wales. Aspirations
for Wales. And as he said, he is not here to manage Wales, he is
here to change it. It means using our resources in a more people
focused way. We will be short on resources in the future. We have to
use our or on resources. It has got to be led by a vision. I know this
is not very detailed. But I think Plaid Cymru must stand out from the
crowd by saying, we exist, Wales exists, because we have ambitions
for Wales. Looking after the older people, and giving our children a
good start in life, and then developing the skills needed for
the world's economy, but concentrating on our on resources.
There did appear to be at the loss of the of this intense of Mr Ward's
the individual. People might find that very laudable. You might
imagine that would be more expensive not less expensive?
Sometimes if you do not focus on the individual enough, problems
persist during a lifetime rather than being effectively managed and
changed. I agree. This was asked each of philosophy. It was not a
speech of great detail. We had some discussion of broadcasting policy.
Rejection of GP commissioning? have been rejecting that for many
years. There was one bit of the speech that I did sit up and listen
to it twice almost, and that was when he talked about the status quo
at the moment, the status quo they almost inherited from Labour in
terms of how the state delivers. We would hear more about that, perhaps
tied into the idea of the individual, as we approach the
election. Did that indicate an advance excuse for cuts? Being
short of resources and faced with big cuts, it does not mean we have
to sit back and take things as they are. We have been changed things
for the better. It has to be focused on the needs of people.
Tommy   ,    we are at decentralised party. That is
central to our thinking. We have to use our resources. This comes back
to the green question, the environmental question. Use energy
locally. The green agenda is coming into its own because it is probably
the best way forward. Was it his voted winning speech?    a speech
that will win voter? I think he has done enough to offer some
tantalising glimpses of the philosophy we will see in 2011.
Adrian, the philosophy of Ieuan Wyn Jones, something to digest.
Thank you. He has been keeping a very busy. Far too cheeky for his
own good. About 20 minutes left of this live coverage of the Plaid
Cymru annual conference in Aberystwyth. Stick around. One of
the people we will be interviewing will be Honorary President, Dafydd
Wigley. I am joined now in our little section of the Arts Centre
by rural affairs minister, Elin Jones. Enjoying a conference?
I think it has gone well. I have done my speech. I can relax.
A couple of things we are identified that the party is trying
to do. Set the party on an election footing, set out the party has a
serious and distinctive party in its own right. Is that a fair
assessment of what you're trying to achieve? Yes, it is. Good, I got it
right! You have been listening! Six months before the next election,
accused the important collection for Plaid Cymru. The Assembly is
important, the democracy of where it is important. We have plans and
aspirations as to what we want to achieve in that Assembly. Hopefully
that Assembly will not be an Assembly by next May. Hopefully it
will be a proper parliament if the people of Wales and vote yes.
need a good Assembly election because you had a row be general
election?    a difficult general election. Obviously we were
disappointed with the Westminster election. We made no gains. We lost
no seats. We would have hoped to do that. The Assembly election is
different. It will be fought on a whale spaces. Plaid Cymru will have
a record of delivery to defend in Government. More importantly, we
are starting in this conference, and we will have put together a
manifesto to hopefully inspire the people of Wales that we are the
people who have the ideas and ambition. You talk about the
Assembly Government record. You have been in coalition. It has been
a partnership. How do you set about telling people that x, y, z
achievement is Euros, and a, Beye     A, B, C achievement is Labour?
do not want to analyse the last few years. Sometimes you claim credit
for Labour policies. It has always been our policy as a party to
support the foundation phase. It was that commitment of the one
Wales agreement. We are fully supportive of the foundation phase
into the next Government. We want to build on that. We have come up
with ideas already for the 7 14 age group in Wales, the next age group
where we need to invest time. The idea possibly of a third language
for seven year olds, to make our young people trilingual. How do you
say to somebody on the doorstep this is what you have got? It is
all too easy to say what you have not got in terms of Welsh language
daily newspaper, perhaps even the laptops have not been delivered as
you would like. It is harder to say the things that you as the party
have achieved in Government. Government has brought into Wales,
and Plaid Cymru brought this into Government, new ideas and new
commitments for this Government. We will have, next year, as part of
that commitment, we would have a referendum for if all proper
parliament.    Faure for proper parliament. We wanted a proper
parliament so that we can have legislation made in Wales that meet
the needs of people in Wales, rather than going cap in hand to
Westminster. We brought back into the coalition agreement. I do not
think there is much doubt about that. Also, the fact that we have
exposed and have independently verified, the funding allocation to
Wales being insufficient. It is not fair. That has been exposed. We
have been saying that for a long time. Labour have come around to
that understanding. There have been in denial for quite a while. They
are understanding now. We want to make sure we get the right amount
of funding for Wales. These will be difficult plans for a public sector
funding. We need to get our When you're leading was    leader
were sitting there and asked them some questions, particularly as to
what might happen after the next election. All the signs seem to be
if there is a coalition, you a favour working with Labour again?
You were virtually ruling out working with the Conservatives?
do not buy to rule anything out. Or rule anything in, but it makes it
more difficult to consider working with the Conservative and Lib Dem
party in government in London and currently not elected to
undertaking the bar at reform. The review of our funding policy.
that position makes it harder to maintain your distinctive identity?
Being something different? People think, the chances are, they will
be a Labour Party and Plaid Cymru coalition afterwards? He will not
take that for granted, and it certainly not want to take that for
granted. But the political dynamics make it much more challenging for
there to be an non Labour government for the next election
but, mind you, the tantalising prospect of Plaid Cymru leading the
Government is still tantalising and as we heard, or leader wants to be
the First Minister of Wales and once that opportunity. I have
remained unscathed so far so I would just go for it   there are
you likely to be the next leader of Plaid Cymru? You have just heard me
say that I never rule anything out! That is yes in my world! Not in
mind. I had not honestly given us any thought? I am absolutely
committed... When people suggest that your leadership material, he
must think, OK? I am one of a bunch of people that are being talked
about. I can give you a lot of cliches at this point because
different people have said over the years. There is a crowd of people.
Who could be or should be the leader of Plaid Cymru following
Ieuan Wyn Jones but he is coming to were at the moment. You could be
amongst that group? Well... pushing us as far as I can. Thank
you very much for talking to me. I have emerged unscathed from several
dodgy questions. Mark? I am amongst the delegates once again. Some more
people with interesting things to say. The party's candidate. And
there member for South Wales West. Stefan, we have the people are
broadly happy with the tone of what Ieuan Wyn Jones had to say with his
vision, is there enough to distinguish a party from Labour
going into the election? The first thing to say about the speech was
that he not only said and very innovative set of ideas but
increasingly he sounds and looks more like a First Minister in
waiting and I was delighted he put that into his speech, that his
dream is to be the first Plaid Cymru First Minister for Wales and
that really set the tone. We're prepared to campaign for Plaid
Cymru. I think what he demonstrated an what he said clearly was that
just because there cuts being forced upon us and Westminster does
that mean that we give up and our ambitions for Wales, we have to be
more innovative, we have to inspire people to think a more different
ways in order to be a prosperous country. It is difficult for us to
understand what the cuts will mean. We know what will be tough but what
is tough? Can you push forward this innovative agenda in that climate?
That is a challenge. We are offering an alternative vision to
the Unionist parties, if we had the money and the finances, in Wales,
as a government, we would be able to do a lot more and beneath the
Tories and Wales to do that. And I am looking for to have a referendum
in Wales to have a job of delivering for the people of Wales
as opposed to going cap in hand to Westminster. Is it going to be
difficult to keep the right degree of unity with Labour and the other
parties and the assembly before the referendum whilst preparing the way
for a fight at the Assembly election? The timing isn't ideal,
we're going into the assembly election and that his wife and is
calling two years ago for the yes campaign previous to this but at
the end of the day it's important for the people to have a voice on
future powers for Wales and we'll be fighting on the doorstep and the
National Assembly elections, and I think people in Wales can
understand that and it would not do them any justice if we undermine
them for not knowing what the distance    difference was. You are
talking about the economic development plan and that is to be
crucial to all of her plans for the future? It was the most exciting
economic programme the Assembly has launched a new could see the
reaction from the other parties, hinting they would love to have
implemented those plans. What will be different? When you have Plaid
Cymru ministers and government, we will never buy a, our plans are
delivering the best for the people of Wales and we are driven by that.
We have a referendum for proper powers from national assembly and a
couple of months after we have an election to determine which
government has the guts to use those powers to the full in order
to protect wheels and public services and at the same time have
a exciting time for the future. That rules are there to do the job?
When we have the referendum, of course. We have ambitions for Wales
and it's important to have a strong team in the National Assembly and I
am confident that we can win in my area so it's important to push
forward in the South Wales Valleys. Where people have clearly lost
heart. The stakes could not be any higher. We cannot underestimate the
next few months for this party but they seem to be ready for the fight.
That message has come through loud and clear. Nearly time for us to
finish but before that we will wrap things up with two heavyweights and
that is their intellectual standing, not anything else. Thorn Roderick
and Dafydd Wigley. Still not Lord wiggly? You will see if I ever will
be! Among gross and for rocks! Thank you for joining us.    and
will grow forelocks. I'm sure you will tell me that this was a
triumph how was it different? is fascinating is the confidence
coming through, not only from the government ministers and members of
the assembly group, but also the fact that the membership is
accepting the lead in full support. We think the membership is
sometimes uncomfortable with these decisions? He will always find on
any specific subject that there are one or two people who are unhappy
and no doubt the media will always find them to give a common. It
seems here that the overwhelming majority are in front support of
the line being taken. This gives Ieuan Wyn Jones a lot of wind in
his sails. And it's going to be a fascinating collection,
particularly if we have the full powers that are necessary after the
referendum. Do you share that assessment? It was an interesting
conference and it could be key. A number of people have said they
remember the conference your way back in 1997, the conference
immediately after the devolution referendum and it was the last
appearance of Quernmore Evans, the former president, at a party
conference and the former MP made a speech which he predicted that
Plaid Cymru would come second in the assembly elections. And we
rubbished that. You'll never beat the Tories. And they did. This
conference has something of that atmosphere. That hit in confidence.
It could be false, of course. But there are things that suggest that
after the general election, which was very disappointing, by and
large it was a poor showing, that there are signs that the political
landscape might be changing in Wales that suits Plaid Cymru,
particularly with what is happening to the Lib Dems and also what is
happening to the Conservatives in terms of the sort of messages
they're sending it, which are not the softer messages that the Welsh
Conservative Party has used in the past. There are two differences,
the election to the assembly is in all Wales context and it is
becoming an increasingly different context where individual parties
are taking a different stance regarding Wales to the stance the
London based parties might be taking. The second is the impact of
the policy changes which the Lib  Dems have to support now that they
are in, he climbed and sinker, with the Conservatives and some are
going to be very unpopular. Understandably so on Westminster
Times, there try to get them over in the first couple of years but
that this election it will be difficult for Tory and Lib Dem
candidates. One more factor is what we have learnt from the first three
Assembly elections is that there is no clever short cut to doing well
in Assembly election, it's no good tried to get the tactical vote on
the list or running a big national campaign for a big name on the
North Wales this, you have to fight this constituency by constituency,
it is a ground game. Going into next year's assembly elections, the
point is that for Plaid Cymru members, these are the most
important? That's not true of the other parties. Labour is
desperately short of money, doesn't have a lot of money to fight them
and the Lib Dems are release struggling and anyway will have the
a the referendum, which excites and, and the Conservatives, they might
be fairly relaxed after the success at Westminster. So there is a
fitting that Plaid Cymru will be more gung ho. Having said that, in
a period of cuts in the economy, the Labour message of, we are the
traditional defenders of the Welsh working class, come home to Labour,
forget Iraq and what you didn't like about Tony Blair, come back to
Labour and stand up for the traditional working class
communities, that is the hugely potent message. Of course it's a
strong message but Labour have a huge albatross round their necks,
that they got us into this mess, it was the deregulation of the
Thatcher era that started this and Labour had 13 years to put it right
and they have not and we are facing the cuts as a direct consequence of
that and what matters most for Plaid Cymru is we have detailed
policies. Once we know what comes out of the spending review next
month, detailed policies of what can be done, even within these
budgets. And it does make sense to the electorate, we can do our best
despite this. What do you want to achieve at this moment that you
both have identified as a possible moment? Realistically, what are the
options? More of the same, junior partner in the Coalition, could you
leave the Coalition with Labour? Could you go further? We want to be
the largest party. And it's up to the electorate to decide how that
pans out. Then it's a question of who is willing to co operate in the
circumstances and we cannot work that out until after the election.
We know how difficult it was last year. The mood music has been
against working with the Conservatives again. It does look
slightly unlikely. The Conservatives in Wales were going
to pitch the wagon to the Conservatives in Westminster but
you might see distancing. That is a different question. If you put
Plaid Cymru into bed with Labour, last time it was because Labour
Brent power in Westminster and could deliver a referendum which
the rainbow coalition could not and power in Westminster is in the
hands of the Conservatives and Lib  Dems. What he thought they were to
say as part of the Coalition negotiations was, we will deliver
you something that Labour cannot, a view to the    change to the
Barnett Formula? That might change things. Of course, the money is
critical and we must argue the case that cuts in Wales should be £300
million a year less than what they would be otherwise because that
money is going to us. If that was an offer, could that 10 to? That
