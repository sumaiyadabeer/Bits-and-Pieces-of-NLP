Mr Deputy Speaker, with permission I wish to move the motion standing
in my name of. The terms of the motion are narrow in terms of a
statutory instrument, but, as I think you Road yesterday evening,
you would like us to entertain debate on the wider issues involved
because they arouse very strong feelings inside and outside the
House. The instrument that we are discussing here is a central part
of a policy that is designed to maintain high quality universities
in the long term, which tackles the fiscal deficit and provides a more
progressive system of graduate contributions based on people's
ability to pay. Let me just briefly go over the sequence of events
which has led to this debate today. I became Secretary of State in May
when the Brown report was being conducted. It had been commissioned
government had asked the former chief executive of BP to conduct a
report in order to prepare the way for an increase in tuition fees,
last government. I will take interventions later. I've been
introductions brief. As Honourable Members know, I am very happy
taking interventions. I will take them when I have developed an
argument. Order, order. The Secretary of State, can you resume
your seat for a moment? I apologise for having to interrupt. There are
strong opinions on. That is understood, that is accepted. What
not receive a fair hearing. The right honourable gentleman will be
heard. If members are making a noise and then expecting to be
called, I fear that a triumph of optimism over reality. When I
became Secretary of State I invited Lord Browne to make two adaptations
to the terms of reference that he undertaken under the previous
government. The first thing I asked him to do was to see how we could
make the existing system of graduate payments more progressive,
more related to the ability to pay off future graduates. He undertook
to do that and we have done further work to develop the system. As a
result of that, the IFS was able to conclude that the package we have
produced is more progressive than the existing system and more
progressive than the Brown report, and concretely what that means it
is just a little under 25 % of all future graduates will pay less than
they do under the current system that we inherited from the Labour
government. The second request I made of Lord Browne was to ask him
to look thoroughly at the alternatives and particularly at
the alternative of the graduate tax. Like many people coming fresh to
this issue, I thought the graduate tax was a potentially good and
interesting idea. I wanted it to be properly explored. The conclusion
he reached was the same conclusion that the Dearing report reached
under the Labour government. It was the same conclusion that the
current Shadow Chancellor reached when he had responsibilities for
this policy. And the conclusion was that the graduate tax as many
disadvantages, or at least be pure graduate tax as many disadvantages.
It's undermines the independence of universities but, most seriously of
all, it is, in the words of Lord Browne, simply unworkable. I am
therefore surprised... I will in a moment... I am therefore surprised
that the leader of the Labour Party, after all this experience and
independent analysis, has chosen to drive his party down the cul de sac
I will take the minister's intervention after just reading him
a comment from what I would have thought would have been one of his
political allies. The education editor of the New Statesman.
Normally very favourable to the Labour Party. He commented on the
position. Labour he said has been seduced into sentimental sloppy
thinking, that defends the interests of the affluent, not the
poor. To describe students as facing a lifelong burden of
crippling debt, is simply bizarre., particularly for a Labour leader
who wants to replace the debt with a graduate tax, that the rich would
avoid. Thank you.. On the issue of sloppy thinking, crucial to the
Government's case has been its add va Voe ka si of the national
scholarship fund but since the weekend when he announced further
details isn't it the case his plans are unravelling fast? Yesterday,
Institute for Fiscal Studies saying it provides a financial incentive
for universitys to turn away students from poorer background.
How will he fix it The national scholarship scheme is still open to
consultation. From him and Vice Chancellors and others, in order to
achieve an objective, which I hope she shares, which is to ensure that
people from disadvantaged backgrounds, achieve access to
higher education, something they have miserablely failed to do under
a Labour Government n the Russell Group universities. As it happens,
the ISF were looking at one of a series of options and they were not
taking account of the fact under the scheme we propose, tho
universities that wish to progress beyond the £6,000 cap will be
obliged to introduce the scholarship scheme without the
detriment he described.. I am grateful to the Secretary of State,
but he knows that the central issue is the fact that the teaching grant
is to be cut by 80%. And that is the burden of that is to be
transferred to students. It is justified by the Government's
assessment of the scale of the deficit. Yesterday, in evidence to
the Treasury Select Committee, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
admitted that there were tens of billions of receipts from
reprivatisations, not included in the Spending Review, which he is
now anticipating. What estimate does he put on those receipt, and
to what extent have those receipts been taken into account, in his
calculations about the scale of the deficit and the cut in the grant?
am glad of the intervention. Lacking progression but his
intervention is hipping in directing us to the heart of this
debate which is how we fund universities and where the money
comes from. That is what I wish to deal W I now intend to move on to
that issue and I will take other interventions later. The Browne
Report... I will move on the the financing.
He is not giving away at the moment. What Lord Browne
recommended in terms of funding universities, and this was the
report that came from the Labour Party Government endorsed in their
manifesto was a recommendation    recommendation that there should be
no cap on fees in university, and a specific proposal for a claw back
mechanism, which gave universities an incentive to introduce fees up
to a level of £15,000 a year. That was the report that was given to
the Government. And we have rejected those recommendations. We
have proposed instead that we proceed as the statutory
instruments describe, the introduction of a fee cap of £6,000
in exceptional circumstances, rising to £9,000. I will now
explain the basic economics of that problem, in the light of the
intervention which has just been made by the former minister. No I
will not give way. I will give way later, when I have finished this
particular point. The right honourable gentleman, the
opposition spokesman on this matter, I think rather helpfully sent round
a circular letter to MPs yesterday, when he sketched out the basic
economic framework within which these decisions have been made. He
said ""MPs have been asked to vote on increasing the fee cap to £9,000.
He didn't mention the £6,000 because the Government is choosing
to make a disproportionate cut to the university teaching budget,
with a Spending Review with an average cut of 11%." No. I will
finish this point. The whole point here, as the right honourable
member knows, is that this Government, like the last
Government, is not making average across the board cuts of 11% in
every Government department. No, no, absolutely. We have chosen as the
last Government did, to have some protected Government departments,
health, schools, pension, aid, the consequences of which, the logical
consequence of which is that there are much higher cuts in unprotected
departments. I am sure the right honourable gentleman remembers the
analysis of the institute of fiscal studies which told news the wake of
the March budget that a Labour Government, a Labour Government was
planning to cut unprotected departments by 25.4%.. I am
grateful to the right honourable gentleman, as he has been good
enough to refer to my lerbgts and he knows full well, that that IFS
analysis done after the budget does not stand up to scrutiny and
neither reflects the decisions taken by the Chancellor in his CSR
or in the speech made by my right honourable friend setting out our
approach. Could the Secretary of State help the house, could the
Secretary of State help the House by identifying which other major
spending programmes have been cut by 80%? The 80% fact, and it is a
fact, derives from the following. Most major Government departments,
as they would have done under a Labour Government, have had to take
spending reductions of something of the order of 25%. And I wish to
take him, and his colleagues opposite, through what that has
meant for the teaching grant of universitys and university funding
in general. Let me just develop this point and I will take an
intervention. What were the options for a department, facing 25% cut,
of the kind that he himself was going to introduce? 70% of all
spending in this department is on universities. He could, I could,
have chosen to make the cuts elsewhere. The largest category is
further education. We could have made the choice to cut
apprenticeships, to cut skill level training, at a modest level, to
Troy and deal with the problem, which we have inherited of six
million adults in this country, who do not have the basic literacy of a
12 year old. We could have cut that. But we chose not to cut that. We
did not cut that. So we were left with a decision of how to make cuts
in the university budget, of approximately 25%. And there were a,
various option, I will finish this section and then I will take an
intervention. There were arious options for doing it. We could have
   various. We could have reduced the number of university students.
200,000. But all the evidence suggests and the last Government
used to argue increasing university participation is the best avenue to
social mobility so we rejected that option. We did not cut large
numbers of university students. We could have made a decision which
would have been easier and less visible and less provocative in the
short run, we could have made a decision radically to reduce
student maintenance. Could have done that. And the effect of that
would have been to reduce the support which low income students
receive when they are at university now. And we rejected. We rejected
that option. We could have taken   please. We could have taken what I
would cause r call the Scottish option. We could have cut funding
to universities, without giving them the means, I will take an
intervention shortly. Without giving them the means to raise
additional income, through a graduate contribution, and the
certain consequence of that would have been that in five to ten years
time, the great English university, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and
the rest would still be great, world class universities, and
universities like Glasgow, which I used to teach at and Edinburgh
would be in a state of decline. So we rejected conscious ly all of
those options.. I am very very grateful to the Secretary of State.
Does he begin to understand and appreciate the impact, disastrous
potential impact on Scottish universities by trebling tuition
fees in England. What is he going to do to mitigate this impact for
Scotland? P. I will not be following the advice of the
Scottish nationalist in Government, who are starving Scottish ruin
versetys of resources, and reallocating priorities to cut
schools. Because that is what has happened in Scotland.. I thank my
Right Honourable friend for giving way. I am sure we can agree all
those students that would benefit from a university education could
be entitled to do so regardless o their financial situation. My
particular concern is by increasing the tuition cap parties    tar tirs
   participation for lower income will fall away. What    that
corrective action will be be taken, should participation levels be seen
to be falling away. Yes, of course I can give him that assurance, of
course the policy will be monitored, and it will reflect that the
evidence that emerges from the policy. That we have put in place,
a series of measures, not merely to protect low income graduates, which
we have done through the threshold, but we have also put in place a
series of measures designed to help children from low income families,
go to university, notably by increasing the maintenance grant
from the level it was under the previous Government, giving access
to an extra 500,000 people. I will take one more.. I am grateful to my
Right Honourable friend. I wonder if he could say something about how
he sees the future of the position of English students, relative to
Scottish and Welsh students in the future. Shouldn't we be looking to
a degree of fairness between families of similar economic
circumstances, across the United Kingdom UK in years to come. Well,
I believe as the Government as a whole believes in devolution, and
we believe that the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland have got to make their own decision, but I
think the inevitable consequences of the tightening of public finance,
which is happening under this Government would happen under any
Government, would bound to be, would bound to be that a system of
graduate contributions will happen throughout the yer UK, but that is
for them to decide. At the back.. thank the honourable member for
giving way. Can I just point out that despite this talk of
supporting people on low incomes, I find it quite hard to stomach
hearing this, because in my constituency, for example the
education maintenance grant, the vast majority of young people come
from low income background and will be losing that support, and across
England, 88% of Bangladeshi children benefit from this. If you
just take this one ethnic minority group and white working chas
children, they will be prevented from going on to higher education,
coupled with that, the cuts in the Future Jobs Fund, £1 billion and we
are still waiting to hear. So please think again.
Before the Secretary of State replys an enormous number
of members wish to speak many this debate. I want to accommodate as
many as possible. Interventions from now on must be brief.
Of course I hear what the honourable member says about the
educational maintenance allowance. The existing system we inherited
was an almost clean way sport. Large numbers of pupils did not
needed to stay on at school. But is quite right in the sense of
stressing the fact that there are large pockets of deprivation in
Britain and per constituency in the East End of London is one of them.
We understand that. The purpose of the people premium which is being
introduced into the school system is precisely to address that
problem of giving support to schools and pupils in areas of high
deprivation. I intend to press on. I will take an intervention later.
We have eliminated I think most of the other alternatives to raising
funding for universities. I hope that nobody opposite is seriously
arguing we should drastically reduce the number of students, we
should drastically reduce maintenance, or we should simply
withdraw funding from universities. The only practical alternative, the
only practical alternative was to retrieve income from universities
from high earning graduates once they have left, and that is the
policy we are pursuing. And it today, 50 university vice 
chancellors have come forward and endorsed this approach, the
strengthening of university funding in the long term. Now, the members
opposite who are following these arguments closely have often argued,
we acknowledge this, they say, universities will continue to have
high levels of income, but they say you're replacing public funding
with private funding, and this is the ideological. It's a debating
point and I'm happy to take it on. At present, roughly 60% of the
income of universities in different funding streams comes from the
public sector. The rest comes from private sources. Something the last
government were trying to encourage. It will be reversed in future. In
future, 40%, roughly, of university funding will come from the public
sector and 60% from the private sector. I am a keen to encourage
more private funding of universities. Which is why I have
spoken to the director general of the CBI and he is approaching all
those members in order to ensure that we have a significantly higher
level of employer support for apprenticeships, sandwich courses,
and other things. There is still far too much noise in the chamber.
And, secondly, when the Secretary of State has indicated he is not
giving way, members must not continue standing. That is the
situation. I hope not too many people will regard additional
funding from employers as some are ideological and contaminated,
because we need more resources going into universities and not
less. That is what we are doing. My colleague. Under the fee scheme
introduced by the Labour Party, all universities ended up charging at
the highest rate. One of the worries out there is that all
universities might end up being allowed to charge. What guarantees
can my friend give that exceptional will be exceptional, and 6,000 will
be the limit for most universities and the country? Yes, but is a
highly pertinent question in the light of the experience of the last
government. It had a two Tear system. There was a migration of
all universities to the top of the range. They operated like a cartel
and that must not happen again. There are several ways by which
this will happen. First of all, any university which wants to go beyond
6,000 will have to satisfy a very demanding tests of access for low
income families, including the introduction of the scholarship
scheme. New institutions, providing accredited courses, will drive down
the costs of high quality basic teaching. And, if necessary, if
universities defy the principle of operating in a competitive cost
bases, we may well have to introduce additional measures to
observe the principles... Order, order. I apologise for interrupting.
He must address the House. His natural courtesy courses in to look
at the member to me is responding. I'm simply saying... There are
other mechanisms by which universities will be required,
which exceed the £6,000 level will not be allowed to behave in the way
they have behaved under the last government. Let me just proceed. Of
course, increasing the graduate contributions, it's bound to have
an impact. An additional cost to graduates. Therefore, I just want
to summarise the steps we are taking to make sure that this
happens in a fair and equitable way. First of all... No full time
students will pay upfront tuition fees. Part time students, doing
their first degree, for the first time, unlike under the last
government, will have the opportunity to obtain conventional
finance under the arrangements of the student loan scheme. Yesterday
I made a further announcement that, after discussing this issue with
the Open University and others, we will increase the range of that
access from students who were originally proposed a third of
their time in part time education, to those spending a quarter of
their time. This will widen enormously the number of part time
students who have access to supporting finance in order to
pursue their education. Thirdly, we will introduce a threshold for
graduate repayment, 21,000, significantly higher than before.
And it will be up graded annually in line with earnings. I think it
is important to emphasise that point, because, under the Labour
government, there was a threshold, £15,000. It was never up graded. On
any basis whatsoever. I wish to communicate what I said yesterday
that, in future, students under the current arrangements, the Labour
government's arrangements, who are paying 15,000 threshold, will, in
future, have annual operating with inflation. These existing students,
who are the last government did absolutely nothing to protect, will
have inflation proofing. Furthermore, we are introducing the
variable interest rates are so that those on high incomes pay
relatively more, to insure the scheme works. And, as a result of
this, a £30,000 salary will carry a monthly payment of approximately
£68, which is, incidentally, far lower than what exists under the
graduate tax system, because under a graduate tax system, people pay
much earlier and at much lower No, I'm not. The Secretary of State
must be allowed to continue. Order. He must be allowed to continue his
argument. In terms of the measures we have taken, to improve access to
low income families, the suburb problem of low income graduates, we
have made it very clear there will be additional grant of provisions.
In addition, the off a requirement of the university's wishing to move
to a third higher threshold, will have demanding tests in respect of
access. It's worth recalling the situation that we have inherited.
There is a lot of crocodile tears opposite about low income families
but let me just remind them, social mobility from disadvantaged
backgrounds, trying to get into university, has deteriorated over
the last decade. We have a position, we have at the moment... 80,000
free school meals pupils, of which only 40 needed to Oxbridge. Out of
80,000.    made it to Oxbridge. That is less than some of the
leading independent schools. That is a shameful inheritance. From
people who claim to be concerned about disadvantaged backgrounds,
and we intend to rectify. So I will conclude. I don't pretend that this
is an easy subject. Of course, it isn't. We have had to make very
difficult choices. We could have taken easier options but we were
insistent that, at the end of this, we would be making a substantial...
Point of order. Did the Secretary of State say was not going to give
way, and why is he not? Order. I understand what the honourable
gentleman is saying that that is not a point of order. But it is a
I have given way to several of his colleagues and several of mind, and
I now wish to summarise where we are. If I can just go back to what
I was saying. There have been very difficult choices to make. We could
have made a decision to drastically cut the number of university
students. We could have cut student maintenance. We could have cut
funding to universities without replacing it. But, instead, we have
opted for a set of policies that provides a strong base for
university funding. Which makes a major contribution to reducing the
deficit, and introduces a significantly more progressive
system of graduate payments than we inherited. And I am proud to put
for bat measure to this House.    put forward that a measure to
Order! Order! I understand the The more noise, the greater the
delay, the fewer people will have the chance to contribute. I want
backbenchers to have the chance to contribute and I do... Order, order,
I appeal to members to help me to help them up. The question is
motion three on the Order Paper. Mr John Denham.
On Monday I tabled three questions relating to the evidence
underpinning government policy. And particularly regarding what studies
the Government had commissioned about the potential impact on these
high fees on participation, on a longer courses such as languages,
medicine, law, architecture. Postgraduate teaching courses. They
would you for answering at noon today and there has been no answer.
   they were due for answering afternoon. Can the Government but
to inform us with vital information so we can properly debate on
subject which interests the whole nation. I am in favour of time we
replies to parliamentary questions. He is an experienced hand and he
must pursue these matters through the Table Office and in other ways.
We cannot be detained now by what is just said. The question is
motion three on the Order Paper. Mr John Denham. Mr Speaker, I know the
Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have already walked out on
this debate. It's a shame that, as the two architects of this policy,
they don't have the courtesy to stay and listen to both sides of
the debate. Mr Speaker, I fear I may have to lower the expectations
of my colleagues on the opposition benches today. Because those of my
colleagues who have come here expecting some good party political
knockabout, you turn, broken promises, these policies, described
by the Deputy Prime Minister as a disaster, but now says he believes
in the policy, I'm not going to do that speech. So much of the media
coverage of this issue has been dominated by the Liberal Democrats
that we could be forgiven for thinking today's vote is about the
future of the Lib Dems. It is not about the future of the Liberal
Democrats. It is about something much more important. Mr Speaker,
there are millions of parents and millions of current and future
students who don't care about the Lib Dems, but do care about the
huge fee increases, we are being asked to decide today. And today's
decision must be taken on the facts and on its merits. We do know that
if this Tory measure goes through, with the support or abstention of
the Lib Dems, but Polly will forfeit the right to call itself a
progressive political party. But we also know, Mr Speaker, that this
House can stop this decision today. The deputy leader of the Liberal
Democrats says he cannot support the Government. As well he might,
because his local university will get its funding cut from £38
million to £3 million a year and has already said it wishes to
charge £9,000 tuition fees was a good deputy leader of the Lib Dems
says he may vote against the Government. I would say to him and
others, if he and every member of this House, not just in the Liberal
Democrats, but the Conservatives, Labour Party, and other parties,
too, vote against today, it will fall. Let me set out why they
As my honourable friend wear the Secretary of State said he has 15
Vice Chancellors supporting him. I have a letter from the University
of war wick, they are calling for a public inquiry into the future of
education, what does my honourable friend think about that? Well not
only Mr Speaker, is there widespread disquiet in the academic
community, it was very significant that the Secretary of State
referred to the letter from yuenver    Universities UK but did not read
it out. The reason he did not read it out is it makes it clear that
Universities UK oppose the cuts in higher education funding, upon
which this fee increase is based. The fact he has persuaded Vice
Chancellors with a gun to hair head that this money is going, so this
is the only option in town hardly speaks of him persuading the
university community of this policy. Mr Speaker, as you yourself said
last night the votes today is on a narrow issue, the tee cap. Behind
it's the most profound change in universe funding since the grants
committee was set up in the 1920s. It is the ending of funding for
most university degrees. It is a huge burden of debt on graduates.
It is an untried, untested and unstable market for students.
Though there is always room for improvement, England enjoys a world
class university system. World class in research. A
disproportionate number of the best university, a better research
university, a richness and diversety to compare with the best.
The risks are so high, the consequences so enclear, that no
sane person would rush it through without proper debate or dis
cushion, but today we don't have the promised white paper that tells
us how it is meant to work. I thank the right honourable gentleman for
giving away. While he is talking about changes, will he talk about
his party and him who voted to introduce fees and broke the
principle of free education. That is a fundamental change, he voted
for it, he voted for top up fee, against manifesto commitments each
time. Will he apologise? It was Mr Speaker because of the 2001 Labour
manifesto that we ensured, and I was a backbencher at the time but
with my right honourable friend who is a minister, that that policy did
not come into force until there had been a further general election.
That is not what is being proposed by the coalition today. Now, Mr
Speaker, I am sorry that the Prime Minister has left, because the
Prime Minister did his bit yesterday, to run down our English
university, what did he say about them? He said they were
unsustainable. Uncompetitive and unfair. He didn't say they were
world class, he didn't praise what they h had achieved. He could only
knock them. One uncompetitive. The second most popular destination for
overseas students in the world, the Prime Minister tells the world they
are not competative. Well that does a great deal of help for our
universety, mind you the Prime Minister has interesting thoughts
about overseas students. When he was in China, he said "We won't go
on," we won't go on increasing so fast the fees on overseas students
because in the past we have been pushing up the fees on overseas
students and using that as a way of keeping them down on domestic
students so we have done the difficult things, which is to put
up contributions from British student, so foreign students we
should be able to keep that growth under control. So now we know why
the Prime Minister wants to push these contributions up, to keep
down the price for Chinese students. Extraordinary! Now, Mr Speaker, the
Prime Minister yesterday said, one moment. The Prime Minister said
yesterday, the current model of higher education funding is not
providing enough money. He quotes the Brown review, that public
funding for students is lower than 20 years ago. We are bound to ask,
how the hell did that happen? Because id didn't happen under
Labour. I can tell the Prime Minister how it happened. Between
1989 and 1997, under the last Conservative Government, public
funding per student fell by 36% in real terms. And who was the special
adviser to the Conservative Chancellor at that time? The Prime
Minister was. So if the Prime Minister wants to know whose faulth
it was he needs to look more carefully in the mirror in the
mornings. Of course, now he is at it again. He was cutting university
funding then, he is cutting university funding now, this again
is a Tory policy of cutting higher education, only unfortunately this
time, they have Liberal Democrats to take it through with them. I
will give way. I think him for giving way. Why do you think this
Government is so intent on destroying the humanities base in
this country? This is one of the leader areas of research and
excellence and they with withdrawing public funding, with
what do you think they have against it? Well, hardly for me the try and
get myself inside the heads of the parties opposite, but if you read
what they say, the reality is they think that these things have no
value, unless they have a value in the market place. It is purely and
simply that. I give way then I may make some progress. I am grateful.
The last figures traibl were while the shadow minister    available.
Of the 80,000 children on school meals only 40 went on to Oxford and
Cambridge. Does he not accept that his proposals for graduate tax
would mean less social mobility and those paying a higher amount back
at an earlier stage? No I don't. If the honourable lady will forgive me
I will come to that very point in a few moments. Because of the Prime
Minister's policies, these Tory policies, we in this country will
stand alone with rom fla as the only countries in the OECD cutting
our investment in higher education, what yesterday's speech by the
Prime Minister which was meant to be a defence of this policy shows
is he does not understand the most basic features of the policy he is
putting forward. These fee increases are not designed to raise
extra money. That was Labour's scheme. Our scheme. We took the
difficult decision to introduce top up fees, to add to record
university income. It came on top of record university income. It
enabled more students to go to better funded universities. The
Prime Minister's plan put forward by the Business Secretary is
totally different. Fees are being trebled simply to reduce the 80%
cut in the funding of university teaching, not to raise extra money.
Most graduates will be asked not to pay something to their education
but to pay the entire cost of their university education. University
also have to charge £7,000 £8,000 to replace the money they will lose.
A and many will lose 90% of public funding, that is what is at stake.
This this goings through, English students and graduates will face
the highest fees of any public university system any where in the
developed world. Higher than France. Higher than Germany. Higher, yes,
that the United States. I give way. Will he welcome the nact the
repayment threshold has been increased to £21 thousand and
anyone earning less than £25,000 will be paying less than a pound a
day for their university education. That is on the standard hand out,
and I will dom that point in a moment, I will just say to the
honourable gentleman. I must answer the question. He may not rool lice
£21,000 is in 2016 when it will be worth in real terms what our
threshold was worth when he brought it in. Mr Speaker... I must make
progress. Most graduates will paying off debts for 30 years. The
average is 11 years under the current scheme. The children of
these graduates will have started university before they have paid
off their own fees. And as I will show Mr Speaker, the payment system
is not fair. Would my honourable friend accept that reducing access
and increasing relative price to our competitors will reduce the
productivity and tax receipts of future generation, will undermine
economic growth and what we should be doing is making the bankers pay
their levy, rather than giving it back in corporation tax and invest
that money in higher education in the future productivity and
economic growth of this country? certainly need Mr Speaker, to
sustain investment in higher education, but as again I will show
in a moment, you don't need to adopt our macroeconomic policies,
to know that this Government could have made a different choice even
now, because there is   in a moment. There is no other country in the
world taking the step we are taking, and no other country in the world
can understand why we are doing it. As always, rather than defend their
decision we get the pathetic answer we had no choice. But Mr Speaker,
they did have a choice. Everyone knows they had a choice. We would,
on this side, take a more measured and responsible approach to deficit
reductions, but, but even on their own terms, if the coalition had cut
higher education in line with the rest of public services, we would
have been looking at fee increases of a few hundred pounds. He says to
us today it shouldn't be 10%, it should be 20%. You still wouldn't
be talking about fee increases much different to £4,000. Not the 6 
9,000 the host House is being asked to vote for today. The right
honourable gentleman cannot get away from the fact that most
independent experts agree that the graduate tax, which seems to be the
policy of the party opposite, will make students worse off because
they have to pay back more debt and pay it back earlier. Why doesn't he
address that fundamental point. Let us be straightforward about this.
To explain to others who may be confused. There are two stage, the
first is to decide how much money will be publicly funded, and how
much money needs to come from graduates. The second stage is how
do you get the graduates to make the contributions? The first stage
is the critical one here today, because it is the 80% cut in
university education that is forcing the graduate contribution
so high. On the second point, on the second point ability how
graduates make their contribution f the honourable gentleman will bear
with me I will set out that case in just a few moments. I need to make
progress because I am coming to the issue that concerns many in this
House. The Business Secretary pleads he has no money in its
budget. I don't see why future generations should pay through the
nose for his incompetence by letting his budget being cut more
than anybody else in Whitehall. They id as a Government did not
have to do this. The truth s Mr Speaker, in the long run it will
almost certainly cost the tax payer more. Because what is their plan?
It is this. Every year they are going to borrow £10 billion to fund
student loan, and every year they will write off £3 billion of the
£10 billion they have borrowed because they can't collect the loan,
that is as much they are cutting from the university teaching but as
the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said, as the Higher Education
Policy Institute has said, as London economics have said, the
Government has almost certainly underestimated how much they will,
debt they will have to write off because students are borrowing more
and borrowing it for London, for longer. So students... That is the
mayor. That is the mayor! They are borrowing it for longer. So student,
saddled with debt will be worse off. The universities, cut, will be
worse off. The tax payer will be worse off. If it wasn't so serious,
it would be comic, so let's look at the Government's central claim for
I thank the Shadow Secretary for giving way. Perhaps he could
enlighten us. When he was in cupboards up until May last year,
when Peter Mandelson proposed a billion pounds worth of cuts, did
he support him or speeded instead?    speak against it? It's a very
interesting experience at this dispatch box because, half the time,
no, I'm going to answer the question. Half the time we are told
you know that they plan for dealing with the deficit. Half the time
they say, this is what you were going to do to deal with the
deficit. They can't have it both ways. The truth is, Mr Speaker, as
I have said on many occasions, since the Brown review was
published, no, the higher education budget would not have been
unscathed under our deficit reduction programme. No, it
wouldn't, but it would not have been cut by 80%. We wouldn't put
fees up to £9,000. I want to make some progress on the issue of
fairness. That is at the heart of many of the arguments made by the
Government and questions raised. They say it is fairer for low
income graduates. The Deputy Prime Minister said the bottom 25% of
earners will pay much less in their university education than at the
moment. The Prime Minister said it yesterday. With our new system, the
poorest ward of graduates would pay back less overall than they do
currently. The poorest will pay less and the richest will pay more.
In the last 24 hours, we have had conscience stricken ministers are
saying they have to hang on to the ministerial office, they have to
keep their red boxes and carbs, because this is such a good deal
for low income graduates. They would all be better off, they say.
When I had the Prime Minister saying how troubling fees would
lead anybody better off, I thought, I have heard that voice summer
before. Last night, I remembered who it was. He is the bloke who
does those adverts on daytime television. If you have got bad
debts, credit cards, county court judgments, wrap them all up into
one simple payment and reduce your monthly payments. We all know what
is wrong with those adverts. They charge you higher rates of interest
and you end up paying much more. It's exactly what the prime
minister is proposing today. We all know what is wrong with the Prime
Minister's claims, so let's have a look at what the Government claims.
I have to say, we, on this side, don't accept the comparison to
government make between their scheme and ares. We think they had
chosen be    the current scheme. We think they had chosen their
assumptions to produce the figures they want. £15,000, the threshold
set in 2006, is the same in real terms as the £21,000 in a 2016.
Let's look, nonetheless, at the Government figures. They say a
graduate of the bottom 10% will pay less. By how much less? What is the
change which has led the deputy prime minister, the prime minister,
many ministers to say this is so fair, so wonderful, I will tell you.
On the Government's own dodgy figures, the poorest 10% of
graduates will pay just £88 less a year on average. One pound 60 a
week. That's right, £88. Now, as the advert says, every little helps.
But to see MPs and ministers sell their consciences for just £88 a
year is a tragedy. Because if the Government's real name was to ease
the pressure on the lowest paid graduates, I would support that.
They would only need to have made a minor changes to the current scheme
to achieve that aim. There is nothing about that a tiny benefit
to the lowest income graduates that justifies doubling or trebling the
debt of the vast majority of graduates. The IFS said yesterday,
graduates from a 30% of the poorest households will pay more. The
heaviest burden, the hardest hit in terms of how much of their innings
they will have to pay over the coming years, the graduate on
tobacco earnings gets hit hardest. They will be hit harder than
graduates who go into the highest paid jobs. That's of the House of
Commons library says. That's what London Economics says. That is what
somebody else says, the House might wish to listen to. They will
remember it David Rendell, who, for many years, or the higher education
spokesman of the Lib Dems. The member for Newbury. In an e mail I
have received, he said to a number of his colleagues the following.
"There are those who claim the current proposals are progressive.
graduates will pay more than poorer graduates because for all the a
higher earning and middle earning graduates, over their lifetimes,
the more they earn, the less they pay since a large part of it as the
vocation of charging tuition fees is a higher lifetime earnings of
graduates, a scheme in which graduates with a large lifetime
earnings pay less than graduates with comparatively small lifetime
earnings cannot be regarded as either a progressive off there. In
