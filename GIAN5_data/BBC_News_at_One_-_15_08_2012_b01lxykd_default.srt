Later on BBC London, from stoke Mandeville to the Olympian Stadium,
the route for the Olympic torch relay is announced. The great
bicycle swindle   more than 26,000 Good afternoon and welcome to the
BBC News at 1.00pm. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for
between April and June and now stands at 2.56 million. Youth
unemployment has also fallen below the one million mark. There was a
big rise in the number of people in work   the highest since last
summer. Half of them were in London, suggesting a jobs boost in the run 
up to the Olympic Games. Here's John Moylan. The outlook for the
economy may be unsettelled, but there is a warm glow around the
labour market. For the fifth month in a row, unemployment has fallen.
for work to be rising and the number of people in work to be
falling. Instead, this is really baffling economists   the exact
opposite is happening. I know economists are struggling to figure
out what these figures show and what the figures apparently around
the economy show, but right now what I am simply saying is the
robustness of these figures is good news. It's good news for those
young people who have been going back into work, and it's good news
for those adults who have been going back into work as well.
good news means the unemployment rate has fall on the 8%. The
numbers claiming jobseeker's allowance fell by almost 6,000 to
1.59 million. What's more, the number of people in unemployment
rose by 201,000. But around a third of those jobs are part time. Many
others, like Jackie Connell, are people working for themselves. That
sounds great, but she had to register as self employed just to
get work that amounts to ï¿½200 a month. I do feel that I am a hidden
figure because I'm not unemployed, but I am not employed. I am self 
employed, but I am not an interpreneur setting up my own
business making my own money. I am basically just doing casual work.
But Labour argues many of the new jobs were in London, possibly
linked to the Olympics and that it's not all good news. In about
half of Britain's regions, you have unemployment not going down. You
have unemployment going up. Perhaps most worryingly for the long term,
you have long term youth unemployment   has now tripled. You
have some real worrying science beneath the surface, which is why I
think the Government really needs to act now to put a lot more fuel
in the tank of its back to work perhaps before things get any worse.
Some claim there is evidence firms may switch from hiring to firing in
a matter of months. Employers are telling us they can hold on to
staff for the next three months or so. The key critical phase will
come at the year end when if there is no discernible sign of growth,
they'll have to let go of staff. The Government insists its flagship
schemes   the work programme and the Youth Contract   are starting
to deliver, but it knows that if the economy doesn't recover, the
fragile glow around the labour market could start to fade.
Our economics editor is Stephanie Flanders. So we're in the middle of
a double dip recess, yet up employment has fallen again. Can we
put this partly down to an Olympic effect? You can see the Olympics in
these figures because a lot of the rise in employment and certainly a
lot of the fall in unemployment has been in London and in sectors you
might associate with the Olympics, but there is a much bigger puzzle
that's extended over the last couple of years and extended across
the country. We're in an economy that is supposed to be flat. We're
not supposed to have produced stuff, yet somehow we have increased the
jobs by several hundred thousand. Private sector companies have taken
on hundreds of thousands of people. We're not sure why they would need
to do that if we're not producing anymore stuff. One reason is we
could see the statistics rise. That is one reason. Another suggestion
is the hid unemployment is the numbers aren't as rosy as the
numbers suggest. Finally, as we saw there, in the next few months the
labour market comes back to reality and unemployment does start to pick
up again, but this is something that is really concerning and a bit
troubling to some of our finest economic minds and policymakers
because it could mean we're just becoming less productive as a
nation   lots of job, which is good news, lots of questions too. Thank
you very much. Virgin Rail has lost its bid to
continue running the West Coast Main Line after the Government
awarded the franchise to its competitor FirstGroup. They've
promised cheaper fares and a better service, but Virgin boss Sir
Richard Branson today described the decision as risky and said he was
extremely disappointed. Here's our transport correspondent Richard
Westcott. His report contains some flash
photography. It's the end of an era   no more
flag waving, no more fanfares, and he didn't see it coming. After 15
years Sir Richard Branson, master of publicity, is off the railways  
from December, the UK's biggest rail company, FirstGroup, will run
the services from London to Glasgow. We're delighted to have won the
contract. This is a fantastic first step for us to rebuilding our rail
portfolio and to do it by winning what is really the largest train 
operating company in the land. It's quite a great thrill. We have great
plans for this railway, so we're really excited to get started.
losing boss is angry. In a statement, Sir Richard Branson
After 15 years, that famous Virgin logo is going to disappear from
Britain's trains, certainly for the time being anyway, but apart from a
change in the colour skwheem, else might change for the millions of
passengers that catch these trains every year?
FirstGroup will buy 11 new trains, adding 12,000 extra seats to ease
congestion. New direct services will link London to Blackpool,
Telford, Shrewsbury and Bolton. And there is a promise of better
catering onboard. But there are also warnings that jobs will go and
fares will rise to help pay for it all. But what do the passengers
think? I think it's a shame in a way. I like Sir Richard Branson,
and, you know, I'm sorry that he's lost it. Virgin's had this since
'97. Surely there must be some sort of improvement that this new
company or new franchise can offer. This all comes down to whether
FirstGroup can attract millions more customers to the line. Two
years ago another company, National Express, had to give up the east
coast franchise early because it couldn't make it pay. There are
fears the same might happen here. FirstGroup have almost bet the farm
on this. It's a massive challenge. The group is pace facing the
renewal of a lot of its franchise over the number of years. We have
run some figures. If it can get growth of about 5% for the whole of
the 15 years and perhaps keep its costs by not going up by more than
2 3% a year it might do it. Virgin will be leaving the station for the
last time this December. Mike Sergeant is at Euston for us.
You have been talking to lots of people this morning. What will this
mean for the passengers and also for the staff who work on Virgin
Rail at the moment? The Government says it will be a great deal for
passengers. FirstGroup says it's going to be laying on these extra
trains, 28,000 extra seats a day, cuts to some fares and investment
in stations, but many of the passengers we have been speaking to
here today have expressed disappointment. They say Virgin was
offering a pretty good service. The trains were generally clean and
punctual. The level of customer service was good. FirstGroup thinks
it can do it even better. The question is whether it can deliver
on its promises, but for those who use this line, they may not notice
that much difference apart from the Virgin logo being stripped off the
trains. The actual trains themselves, these tilting pendolino
trains, they're called, will remain. As for the staff, many will simply
put on a new uniform and carry on working for the new operator. The
unions, though, are warning about possible cuts to staff, changes to
terms and conditions further down the line, but FirstGroup says that
is absolutely not its intention. It wants to invest in staff and get
more passengers onto this railway. Mike, thank you very much.
The man accused of the murder of Tia Sharp has appeared in court via
a video link. Stuart Hazell, who's 37, is charged with murdering the
12 year ld in south London earlier this month. Our home affairs
correspondent, Tom Symonds, is outside the Old Bailey. What did
the court hear, then, Tom? Sophie, Stuart Hazell wearing an orange T 
shirt stared into the video link camera from Belmarsh Prison, where
he's being held this morning and said very little during this
morning's proceedings. At the beginning he confirmed his name. At
the end he said thank you to the judge. He's being represented by
the Liberal Democrats peer Lord Carlisle QC, who said his client
has yet to hear the details of the case against him. That may well be
because the postmortem into the body found in New Addington is
continuing later this week, and it has not yet been formally
identified. Now, the Metropolitan Police say they do believe that it
is the body of 12 year old Tia Sharp, who had often stayed in the
house where Stuart Hazell lived with his partner, Tia's grandmother,
and the hearing ended in about ten minutes. He did not ask for and was
not given bail. Sophie? Tom, thank Olileme, Giny, suffering from ill
health in Cape Town denies involvement in the case. Her
husband, is accused of masterminding the plot.

Kevin Connolly reports from neighbouring Lebanon.
In the heart of the Assad regime's capital, a bomb attack that brought
this conflict dangerously close to the UN monthers in their hotel
beside the military base, which was the target.
The explosives were attached to a fuel tanker, and smoke from the
fire could be seen across the city. It's dramatic evidence of the
rebels' ability too penetrate government security in Damascus.
Even before that breach of security, one of the United States' most
senior soldiers was offering a bleak assessment of the likely
state of the Syrian Army. It is all part of an American strategy to
predict that the Assad regime will crumble, but these words from a
senior military man will carry weight. They are having the kind of
wear and tear that would come of being in a fight for as long as
they have, and I actually think that's why Iran is stepping in to
form this militia to take some of the pressure off of the Syrian
military. Into the chaos, the UN has sent an emergency relief team
headed by Baroness Amos to explore more ways of getting aid in. She
says the key to starting to improve daily life for Syrian families is
ending the violence. The fighting has got to stop. There is a
separate political process, which is trying to get the different
sides to sit down and talk. I think we all very much hope that that
will happen. The people that I have spoken to are all talking about the
importance of peace, of security and stability. They want to go back
home. They want to be able to rebuild their lives. This latest
bomb attack in Damascus won't change the course of this conflict,
but it does show the rebels can pierce the tightest of Government
security. It offers no clue, though, as to how or when the violence

New rules on how much outdoor space schools should provide for physical
education in England are being introduced by the Government.
Critics say the changes will make it easier for schools to sell
playing fields, a claim denied by the Department of Education. Chris
Buckler is at a school in Cheadle Hulme in Greater Manchester.

Team GB, issues of funged and rules about sport are a particularly

Olympics would encourage people it get involved in sport, not just
watch it. But new rules say that schools must now provide only
what's described as "suitable outdoor space." Some claim that
could have an impact on what the Government has called the legacy of
the Games. I'm very concerned that the word "suitable" will allow the
flood gates to open of the sale of school playing fields because it
suddenly becomes a really subjective judgment.
The coalition insists that strict rules about school playing fields
remain in place, although campaigners say some have been sold
under the current Government, including land here on the
outskirts of Rochdale. But the school where this development is
taking place no longer exists. It closed in two two,000 10. The
Department of education says that's the case in 14 of the 21 cases in
which playing fields have been approved for sale and in four hours

teacher says sport is still important. If they are outside, it
feels it is more free for them, they don't feel that they are
picking up the skills, but they are, and it is essential. However Labour
say they are concerned about the scrapping of the allowance for
physical education for two hours aweek and the allowance of physical
space. I am concerned about this. As the country was preparing for
the Olympics, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, was preparing
to rip up vital regulations to ensure schoolchildren have the
playing fields they need. And in the years that follow the Games,
the issue of funding for all types of sport, will be an issue for all
the parties. Aside from case whereas schools
have closed or merged, the Education Secretary insist that is
mistake, campaigners say they'll be watching very closely any sales
that do go ahead. Should the rules governing plastic
surgery in England be tightened? A review has been launched after the
safety scare involving breast implants made by the French company,
PIP. Our Health Correspondent Adam Brimelow is with me. It has raised
a lot of questions but the review a far more wide ranging than just
that? That's right, the PIP breast implant scandal caused huge an zit
for many women and the initial review is to do with safety and a
review has looked at it and concluded these implants were not
cancer causing but they tended to rep tour more. We have seen
thousands of women having referrals to have faulty implants assessed
and hundreds of procedures to have the implants removed this. Review
is much more wide ranging, as you say. It looks at the whole of the
cosmetic industry. It'll include surgical procedures, including, for
example, breast enlargement or reduction, face lifts and also
liposuction a procedure to remove unwanted fat. It'll also encompass
other non surgical cosmetic treatments including botox
injections, der McFillers and also laidser hair removal    derma
fillers and laser hair removal Market analysts say in the four
years to 2010 the number of these procedures more than doubled.
will be the questions they will be asking? The starting point,
certainly in terms of cosmetic implants, will be that the
assumption that something like the PIP scandal could happen again,
probably will happen again. So in future we need to be able to trace
these faulty devices and also contact the patients who might be
put at risk. So that could mean a national register for cosmetic
devices. It'll also look at the training and qualification force
people involved in this industry and also    for people involved.
And also practices surrounding advertising and promotion for some
procedures and the panel will report its findings back to the
Government in March next year. It could transform the regulation of
the cosmetic industry. From December cigarettes can only
be sold in Australia if they're in green packets covered in health
warnings, including pictures of mouth cancer and other smoking 
related illnesses. It comes after Australia's highest court dismissed
a legal challenge from cigarette companies and upheld the world's
toughest anti tobacco advertising laws. Now Australia is calling on
the rest of the world to do the same. Duncan Kennedy reports from
Sydney. The decision means that from

Australian parent had worries about their child picking up an addictive

are designed to be less appealing, especially to young people. The
company's name will only appear in small print. But several of the
biggest companies, including British American Tobacco, Philip
Morris, and Imperial Tobacco, have fought plain packaging, saying it
robs them of their established brands and logos without
compensation and may actually encourage a criminal market in fake
or imported cigarettes We still believe it's very bad law and there
is a number of serious unintended consequence that is will flow on,
namely around illegal tobacco and increased smoking rates and issues
with pricing in the industry. move to bring in plain packaging
here is being watched right around the world. Britain, some states in
America, New Zealand, India, they have all shown an interest in what
is going on. And whilst Australia might be a relatively small
cigarette market, the tobacco companies know that losing here
could lead to a deluge of legislation elsewhere, in their
really big markets. But for now, legally, cigarette
companies's last platform to advertise their products has been
denied them. The crucial Third Test match
between England and South Africa starts at Lord's tomorrow. Whoever
wins will be confirmed as the world's best cricket side. England
will be without their star batsman, Kevin Pietersen, who was dropped
after sending provocative text messages to the South African team.
Daniela Relph reports. He is brash, bold and often brilliant.
Sara Runesten Petersen is England's star batsman. But his international
career now hangs in the balance. Dropped for sending text messages,
critical of his captain. Messages sent directly to England's
opponents, some of the South African players. In a statement
issued today apologising, Petersen said: "I did send what you might
call provocative texts to my close friends in the South African team.
I truly didn't mean to cause upset or tension, particularly with
important games at stake." On the eve of a Test Match, England have
to win to retain their number one ranking, the England captain has
spent much of his time doling with the Petersen issue. When he is
playing well and everything is happy in the dressing room, he is a
great asset to the side but that's decision for this particular Test
Match that he didn't play. The real issue here is one of an individual
verses the team. In dropping Petersen, England have clearly
decided that team harmony matches more than one player's talent.
Clearly there are bridges to build. Sara Runesten Petersen may yet
resurrect his England career, but at what cost to his reputation and

everyone gave me the opportunity to to live my dream. I was just
overwhelmed by the fact that those people dedicated so much to me for
me to go and do that. Unfortunately there is only one medal to hand out.
I wish there was more because I would be giving out gold medals for
the souport I have had. Let's have a word with these brothers.
Northern Ireland is now in the sporting map. Definitely. It's
becoming the sporting hub of the world. We're privileged to be able
to put rowing on the map for world rowing. People know where we're
from. People know this is a time that's successful for rowing. As
Alan was saying, you look around at these guys here   you're looking at
future Olympians definitely. A word from your kid brother   what's your

an amazing reception. We got greeted at the airport. People have
been coming to do interviews. Has been cool. Getting back to
Coleraine, it has been nonstop since we have been here. The guys
have come down to show their support here today, and we're back
here to thank them. That's the most important thing. Thank you very
much indeed. You're about to go to the mother of all parties. The

Now the latest weather with lawyeria. Lots of rain.
A lot of it and we are all set to see this wet weather today. The
radar shows it started its journey in the south west, now advancing
pretty startly, north eastwards through Wales, the Midlands and
into Northern Ireland. A lot of rain already today. 27 millimetres
in the Isle of Portland in Dorset. Nearly 20 mill meeters in Exeter.
More recently we have peaked up to 12 mill meeters in Wiltshire and
that band of rain will continue to march northwards but not just wet,
also very windy today. All associated with the low pressure.
It sits out to our west, spiralling around with the strong gusty winds.
The saving grace at least with the strong winds is that the rain
should move through pretty quickly. It is dry and sunny at the moment
in the north east. Highs of 25, but this afternoon, the rain will set,
in the temperatures will drop, the winds will pick up and we'll have a
wet end to the day. Further south we'll see the rain clear away from
Wiltshire, Dorset, Cornwall, Devon and across Wales in the coming
hours and then, yes, the skies will brighten, the sun will come out but
the gusty winds will drive in showers and they could be heavy.
Right along this band of rain there is a chance of thunder ji outbreaks,
through quickly. Scotland enjoying largely fine weather for the time
being it. Won't be until this evening that the rain moves. In
very windy weather associated with the rain as it pushes through
northern England into Scotland. Then blustery winds will bring
showers towards the west. Temperature wise, overnight, a mild
one. 15 28 degrees because we are warming draw air up from the near
continent. Tomorrow a breather, not as wet or windy. The further west
you are, the more likely to pick up showers, the further east you are,
more likely to be dry. Fine at Lord's tomorrow for the cricket.
But, then, our topsy turvey week of weather continues, more rain for
Friday, pulling up from the south. Still fairly mild, temperatures in
the low to mid 20s in the south. That could trigger some thundery
outbreaks. Now as we head into the weekend this, weather front is
pretty reluctant to clear it. Stays with us. Showers likely in the
north. The thing we'll notice is the heat
building, warm air being drawn up from the near continent. We could
get up to 30 degrees in the heat and still though not as hot in the
north a respectable low 20s, so all change through the next few days.
