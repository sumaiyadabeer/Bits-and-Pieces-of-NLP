Welcome to This Week, the show that floats like a butterfly, sting like
and it always ends with a points decision in favour of, yes, you
guessed it, cracking open another bottle of Chateauneuf du Blue Nun.
And boy, did we need a stiff one this week? First of all we read
about the Prime Minister's vanity unit, then we heard that Sam Cam's
posh mates have been hired as global trade ambassadors. And we
discover that judges can remove a sitting MP for lying during an
election campaign! If that's applied nationwide we should be in
international embarrassment of Call me Dave picking up democracy

three Labour MPs standing trial for expenses fraud, no, but Cheryl Cole
refusing to vote in the extract! I have heard of voter apathy, but
this is ridiculous. Songs have been mutilated and murdered so that
Cheryl Cole, you could have the right to vote. And we all know
Katie has got to go anyway. But my key is happy, Wagner is still in
the mix. Of course he gave him a Voce and, voting for his speed

week, is for Harriet Harman to reveal the identity of the dodgy
one night stand she had at Freshers' Week. If you're out there,
let us know. And when we find out, we will all be happy. I'm joined on
the sofa by two men who always punch below the belt   the Million
Dollar Baby of late night chat, fighting out of Pimlico, London,
Iron Mike Portillo. And out of Dagenham by a Notting Hill, still
in London, John "Ding A Ling" Cruddas. Welcome to both of you.
Moment of the week? Well, I quite enjoyed the moment when David
Cameron was talking to the students at Peking University, and called
for questions, and this Chinese student then asked him about
tuition fees. I thought that was quite a nice moment. Of course, it
is not quite what it appears. If it had been a Chinese leader, there's
no way that student would have been able to ask that question. And by
the way, even though it was a British leader, this was of course
not shown on Chinese television, because China is not an open
country. But still there was this little fantasy for a moment that we
were all equal in the world. And this was the Chinese behaving in an
open and democratic way. It has been a pretty eventful week, but
going back to the beginning of the week, it was Rowan Williams, the
Archbishop Canterbury, talking about welfare reform. I think it is
six months to the days since the coalition government has come into
power, and what amazes me is that the Church has not really been
contributing to the debate about the cuts. There was a bit of
jousting with Iain Duncan Smith subsequently, but it reminded me
about the early 1980s, Faith In The City, and that repeated on me
during the week, with the student protests, and there was a sense of
deja vu, almost back to when I was a student. In the sense that these
are the early skirmishes in quite a significant period of social unrest.
I'm glad you chose that, because here on This Week, we love the
feckless and the lazy, you're our most loyal viewers. Everybody else
gets up and changes the Channel, but you're so lazy that you just
sit and son. We were appalled when we heard that the Archbishop of
Canterbury thought welfare reform would punish you all into a
downward spiral of uncertainty. Listen, that's our job, that's what
we do. But welfare reform is a serious business, and now the
Government wants to make the long  term unemployed go out and do
unpaid manual labour or risk losing their benefits. TV's Trisha Goddard
thinks forcing them off the sofa is a great idea. I have worked in
daytime telly for years, and the cliche about people who watch
daytime telly is that they're unemployed layabouts living off
benefits. Let's be honest, some of our viewers are. Well, the
Government proposes to get people like you, yes, you, off your
backside, out the door and out to work. Are you listening? Yes, I'm
listening. Good. If you cannot find a job you will be put to work on a
community project, something like picking up litter or cleaning
graffiti. Those of you who refuse could lose your benefits for up to
three years. As a lifelong FTR was quite surprised at how much I agree
with these proposals, and from a Tory lead coalition. In fact I do
not think they go far enough. I don't think four weeks is long
enough to instil a work ethic or to get back the self respect of the
long term unemployed. Oh, good, you were listening! The right wing
press just love this idea, because they see it as a kind of punishment,
a modern day work house for scrounging layabouts. But this
isn't community service to punish people, this should be about
empowering people, making them feel better about themselves, and there
is nothing empowering about living on benefits. Living in a house
where no one works is like living in a cage   people get trapped by
low aspirations, and they get bored and desperate and caught up in
petty squabbles. Shut up! They make relationships, on Dewing, even
having babies, that becomes their job. I should know because over the
years, that's what they come on my show to talk about. You know what?
We've reached the point where in many households there is more of a
stigma in having a job than in living on benefits. There's no
shame in giving something back in return for a feeling of pride.
There is shame in being a burden on society. From her sofa in west
London to our always game fully employed little sofa here in
Westminster. Welcome. Thank you. Was there a stage when you began to
loons sympathy for those who seemed to be making Welfare a lifestyle?
Not really, I have been involved with a mental health charity, and I
work with other charities, and one of the things they do is to bridge
the gap for people who have been out of employment for a long time.
One thing we have always advocated is being a volunteer. I'm a big fan
of getting people involved with volunteering as a first step to
going back to work. So, elements of this proposal can strike a chord.
You can't go from a household where no one has worked, and maybe your
parents or grandparents have not worked, to having a nine to five
job, just like that. People fall through the gap, they can't turn up
at work, they have a bad experience at work, which may not just put
them off, but the entire community. I hate this punitive aspect, this
kind of, we'll get the lower classes of their backs and back to
work, I hate that. Do you get that sense from Iain Duncan Smith have
no, you did, but that's not where the ordinary person on the street
gets their news from. And very much the right wing press does have that
kind of, this is a punishment. People on council estates are not
sitting around listening to Iain Duncan Smith..
Embarrassed that you agree with the right wing press question I do not
agree with the right wing press. do not like the language. Because
if you make it seem like a punishment, people will not be
interested in doing it. The public mind is moving back to the
Victorian concept of the deserving and the undeserving poor. There are
deserving poor who genuinely need to be looked after, and there's
another bunch, also relatively poor, and they are not even bothering to
look for work, and if you offer them work, do not take it. Yes, it
is interesting what Trisha Goddard was saying about the pash coverage,
and the way this is caricatured. Everybody has 12 kids from 12
different mothers, I worry about the language and the caricatures,
because the people who I see, in 10 years as an MP, are really
struggling. They need help. Also, because of some of the changes
around medical reassessment, I can see a lot more people coming to me
who are really vulnerable, who have been pushed off in capacity, who
have long term degenerative illnesses, or mental health
problems, even schizophrenia, who do not get over the line for the
new benefit. So I think it is a have acknowledged sometimes, if you
read the popular press. That's why I liked the 10 of your film.
you're still sympathetic but the principle, that we should put more
effort into getting the long term unemployed off the dole, with a
mixture of carrots and sticks? Absolutely, child care, you need
proper support structures, real jobs, training... It is about self 
esteem as well. The self esteem of some of these estates, where there
are huge number of people who have never worked, is rock bottom. It is
getting people involved in society, feeling they have got a stake.
long term unemployed, do they lack are worth a thick, or are they just
in a sense making a decision that they're better off on benefits?
John says, the situation is complicated, and both of those
things could be true. What I have found fascinating about this is
Trisha Goddard, a lifelong leftie, making a film like that. And John
speaking so even handedly on the subject. I find it fascinating that
all three parties on a fairly close together on this. I believe there
was a poll this evening on Channel 4 which showed 54% public support
for welfare reform. Let me correct you, that was 58% among Labour
voters, it was over 70% in the country as a whole. So we are at an
extraordinary moment. I suspect this particular issue of certain
long term unemployed being asked to do community work, I suspect this
will be used very sparingly and will only affect a tiny number of
people. I suspect this is a bit of rhetoric, it is about trying to
change public opinion, and to rally support. The big thing announced
today is the idea of a universal benefit, the idea that you will
always be better off when you going to work. I think that is a mite
lives and aspiration, although I'm quite doubtful about whether it
will really be successful. Because it is so difficult to do. I would
like to sit here in 2015 and see whether there has been any
difference at all. And it will take 10 years to come through. But it is
boldness, I think. The devil will be in the detail. But it is a
significant moment in the history of welfare. Is it your view now
that the welfare state, it has been around for a long time, it has got
bigger and bigger, as that process created a dependency culture?
I think the pendulum has swung a bit too far, for all the best
reasons. And a lot of people have been caught up, almost trapped, in
for not working culture. I have got a daughter who is due to leave
university. There are going to be a lot of university students, rather
than these layabouts on estates, who fall into that trap. Wouldn't
it be great if they could start helping out, volunteering, and have
credits maybe to pay off their loan, Their difficulty is that they are
unlikely to get the kind of work that tallies up with the degree
they have got. And many decide not to work at all so why should they
get away with that? How easy is it for a cabinet of 20 millionaires to
do welfare reform? The a will have difficulties with that. There will
be resentment but the extraordinary striking thing of the moment is the
amount of public support they have. I have been a social security
minister many years ago, tried to do some tough things, and we always
assumed it would be in the teeth of massive opposition from the bulk of
the population. That assumption is now completely out of date. Part of
the problem is, is it not one of the great pities, one of the
historic failures of the Blair years, even on the principle of
only Nixon could go to China, the ruling Labour should have done
welfare reform properly? In more benign conditions are as well.
years of growth. James Purnell this week wrote an article saying his
proposals that he presented to the Prime Minister were not dissimilar.
I come back and say the devil is in the detail. Bob Hall Moll, a big
guy in Glasgow who Iain Duncan  Smith had visited, he said this was
harsher than he anticipated. Let's see the colour of the money, let's
see what happens. I see day to day real vulnerability and freer out
there so let's get the balance right. The two is pretty radical
and comprehensive. If it is done properly, it has the potential to
be a game changer in this country. It does, but it is in its most raw
form. Talking about four weeks, I don't think that will work. It has
got to be long term, it has got to be thought out. They have got to be
computer systems to deal with it. We know the government is good at
IT. There is public support for the principle, the coalition has a
radical reform programme, Labour has got to be careful how what
positions itself. Yes, this is dramatic. Things like the housing
benefit, I would have major concerns with that because we could
see it a whole migration of the community. I am worried about some
of the cuts in benefit themselves, but in this there is a few
interesting elements. Douglas Alexander gave it a pretty clear
win, I thought it was a good approach. Thank you. Was it good
looking at yourself on TV? The very weird. I know it is late, but don't
Go breaking our hearts and going to bed without us, because coming up
we have sung man and husband to supermodel Heidi Klum, it is Seal.
There is almost unlimited space on the website to use and    abuse and
disparage us. Harriet Harman got it spot on this
week, you do not hear that very often. She pointed out how we have
all done something we regret in our student days. Michael? John?
Anything you would like to disclose? Who wrote this thesis
them? An analysis of Value Theory, the sphere of production and
contemporary approaches to the reorganisation of workplace
relations. I wouldn't own up to it either, John. In to is vaguely
familiar. As for Michael, look at this crazy photo from back in the
old days. There is a wild one. You can see him tearing up the M1,
smoking a joint. Can we take that picture away, please. Thank you. I
am sorry if that upsets you, you might get nightmares tonight. None
of us went on the rampaged like the youth of today. He was a reminder
of what it was like in our day.    Quiet! Really, I do wish you would
pay attention. Otherwise you will end up like the class of 2009, and
Right, off with you. You, stay behind and see me. That will teach
them, but Westminster could have done with some discipline this week
and I'm not talking about most students. It is the MPs who have
been behaving badly. They have no idea how to behave. Phil Woolas
gets caught lying about his opponent and is forced by a judge
to give up his seat, so Harriet Harman has to show the smack of
firm leadership. We don't quarrel with his judgment. It is no part of
our politics for Labour MPs to get elected on telling lies.
Harriet Harman was not just following her leader, she felt
strongly about it herself. When she tried to explain why they were
chucking Phil Woolas out of the party, did they listen? Did they
help, they were furious with her for throwing such a popular boy it
out. What was there a problem? Maybe they were thinking about the
dodgy election leaflet they had put out themselves. They thought it was
really on offer to expel him. That left Harriet sitting in the corner.
The Labour MP Paul Farrelly had a trip to the headmaster. He threw a
punch at a newspaper vendor during a karaoke evening at the House of
Commons bar and left his victim bleeding on the floor. They keep a
much tougher grip on things at the coalition. This week David Cameron
took four of his senior Cabinet ministers to China, where iron
discipline is revered. No giggling at the back, the soldiers are not
You guys have no idea how much trouble you will be in when you get
down from that roof. The police really underestimated this student
demonstration. They thought they could get them down from the roof
through messages on Twitter. I can see a line of police officers very
bravely trying to hold people back who were intent on destruction.
They were very brave, but there were not enough of them and the
police response needs to reflect that. A trouble is, the coalition
doesn't know which of its cuts is going to cause riots and which will
be just quietly accepted by the public. All of the lead when, one
of the great architects behind the cuts has been talking to the
Swedish prime minister.    Oliver met when.    Letwin. In Sweden, it
turned out to be support for local football clubs that got people or
pronounce for months. I must not upset my party colleagues. If
Harriet Harman spent the beginning of week in detention, by Wednesday
she was desperate to get out. As the students were rioting, she had
her chance at Prime Minister's Questions. We know what it is like,
you are at Freshers' Week, you meet up with a dodgy bloke and do things
you regret. Isn't it true? He has been led astray by the Tories.
Isn't that the truth of it? Deputy Prime Minister tried to
tackle the subject with gravitas but he just dog a deeper hole for
himself. It is quite something to take lectures from the honourable
lady about party management, after the mutiny on Monday. They are
cheering her now, they certainly weren't on Monday. It was too late
though, next time take a lesson from Harriet and get your joke in
first. Stop talking, carry on writing! Some teachers are
desperate to be popular. Some frankly don't give a damn.
President Bush published his memoirs this week, and he was not
going to say sorry for invading Iraq. Apologising were basically
say the decision was wrong and I don't believe it was. So it has
been rioting students and general bad behaviour all round. Teacher,
will you please deal with them? A sharp rap across the knuckles I
think. That is the only language they understand.
Mary is still in detention you know. We are joined by a Lib Dem
commentator. Welcome back to This Week. John, these mini riot we saw,
is that the beginning of something bigger? I have a sense of
foreboding over some of the issues over the next few years. We are
heading for a darker time. We had 15 years of growth, some big
distributional issues. I went on the demo and it was fantastic. I
thought the NUS did great. I thought they were excellent but
obviously there was a minority that made it a bit more lively. Some
students seemed to get carried away with the minority as well. Yes, it
wasn't just them and the problem is that all of this is on the record.
It will be revealed who they were and I feel sorry for some of them.
Do you sense echoes of the poll tax? I don't yet. The possibility
of violence has been present for years. We know there has been a
group of people in the name of anti  globalisation who come out on
the streets and at one time the police employed the technique of
Catling the people of London.    kettling. I don't think you can
judge them by how much violence occurs. We are always the ones on
the front line having to deal with it, but when the famous poll tax
riot took place on a much bigger scale than what happened this week
  I remember the horses charging into Trafalgar Square   did you
sense that was the beginning of the end for the poll tax?
absolutely. That was universally unpopular. As we have been saying,
we are not at that stage of the moment, certainly. Some of the
things the coalition are doing are well supported. In the Times, I
have never read such a red blooded defence on the government policy
written by that newspaper at the coalition has lost public support.
This issue of tuition fees is clearly toughest of all for the Lib
Dems. They are not really convincing anybody, are they?
a tough one because basically they are 269 seats short of an overall
majority and that means they can't implement quite a lot of their
policies. When they did their own costings and thought about things
like cancelling Trident, and therefore they could make pledges
about tuition fees, which they can't do now. They never made a
pledge other than to say they would not let them increase. There was a
vague implication that down the road, in the fullness of time, that
we may get rid of them. But this is really an example of a promise
being made by people who never thought they would be in power or
have anything to do with it. Characteristically, one
characteristically I think you are wrong on this. I think you were
right the first time! There were so many tense discussions about the
costings and precisely what would be accepted by the person writing
the manifesto, Danny Alexander, by Vince Cable who was watching the
finances. Do you buy that, John? That is interesting, it signals
that there were a lot of below the  line conversations before the
election. I think they've worked on the assumption of a different
coalition. Certainly, the costings were Don meticulously and the
pledge was Don and considered. lot barely think they are
vulnerable. I have never seen a targeting of the speaker in the
It was interesting, I was quite impressed with our operation at
PMQs. I thought Harriet Harman landed a few blows, with a bit of
humour, which was not played back. And so therefore he looked somewhat
shrill in terms of his responses. Harriet Harman did very well. She
has had an interesting week. will come on to that in a second.
But the Tories must be sitting back thinking, this is great, increasing
tuition fees by a big amount, in the Tory party, that's relatively
popular, the Tories are saying, we are going to go for that, and it is
Mr Clegg gets the kicking. depends which bit of the Tory party
you're in. David Cameron and George Osborne will generally not be very
happy to see this, because for them it is fundamentally important to
keep the coalition together. They do not want to see Nick Clegg
having too bad a time. I did think Nick Clegg lacked humour in the
House of Commons. I thought he was much better today, standing outside
the Tory headquarters, giving a press conference. I think that's
the way you've got to do it, you have got to front up to it. But
next time he appears in the House of Commons, he will have learned a
lesson. How has it gone down with the Lib Dem rank and file? They are
nervous, but they were nervous from the start, and during the coalition
talks, because we were caught between a rock and a hard place.
You cannot change the outcome, which was that there was only one
possible cause of action, which was to have a coalition with the
Conservatives. Some in that coalition are pleasantly surprised
by the outcome, and the co  operation, and the working together,
and the speed and pace of some of the decision making. But your party
is now presiding over policies that are leading to waiting in the
streets   when did you think that was going to happen? I thought that
was going to happen. I mean, I thought we were going to get
castigated, whatever decision it was that we took. You do not hear
that in conferences, I do not remember hearing that, we will do
this even if it leads to rioting in the streets? There was a sense in
Liverpool, which was picked up by a lot of commentators, that difficult
times were ahead. What we have not even seen yet are the cuts coming
into play. Tell us about the Phil Woolas business. This is tricky,
and it will develop through the next week, because there is a
judicial review, and possibly an appeal. Why is it tricky? Because
in the parliamentary party, there was a sense of grievance, in that
due process was not allowed to unfold. It follows on from the Ian
Gibson case, where he was tossed overboard very quickly. So there's
a vulnerably, a sense of vulnerability. Sir was there a
rebellion? I think there was a rebellion. I was not actually there.
But I know a few people who were. It was quite a tasty meeting. But
we cannot do is, we cannot tolerate this kind of protection which turns
the dial up around scaring the white voters. The it was a damning
e mail, wasn't it? Yes, that was not Phil, but these issues of race
and class, it is very dangerous for us. I think it is pretty clear cut.
I do not accept that most MPs tell lies in election campaigns. I don't
think I have ever mentioned my opponent election campaign. So I
think this is unusual. You think it is a different category from the
normal to ing and fro ing of election campaigns? I absolutely do.
Those people who say we should not have the courts deciding these
things, well, we have electoral law, and how else do you decide things
which are in law? It is true that there is now another process to go
through, but I do not see how the Labour Party could have reacted any
differently. I was just watching Question Time, and it was a good
question from somebody in the audience who said, how would you
expect us to vote for you ever again if you allow this person to
stay? This is trip tricky from the point of view of party management,
rather than anything else. Harriet Harman said that the process has to
complete itself. She has been painted into saying something she
did not quite say. But it is difficult in terms of the feelings,
for someone has been a member of the Labour Party for 35 years. But
we cannot have any truck with this kind of politics which runs up fear
around race. Is his political career job over? I do not know.
There is speculation in the parliamentary party that he is in
more solid ground than had been thought, in terms of the judicial
review, but we do not know that. is extraordinary that there are
Labour backbenches who are defending somebody who thinks it is
OK to say, let's get the white men angry. This guy is trying to get
support from violent Muslims. It is just extraordinary that this kind
of language is acceptable. I think anything which takes a stand...
of course the Lib Dems have never done any dirty tricks. I think Mike
Smithson, who I always see as a good a better in these matters,
went through a lot of history to see if there was any comparison
with this, and he could not find one, so I think this is a one off.
Remember, Phil did this when everybody knew that MPs were under
the spotlight. And he did it in the by election as well. We will have
to leave it there, on this unusual consensus across the sofa. It must
mean it is time to move on. We were going to talk about China, too. But
we will come back to it. It is not going away. On This Week we are
used to being in the glare of the world's media. When your global
celebrities like us, it goes with the territory. Every aspect of your
life is exposed in the press, so how easy is it to cling on to a
sense of perspective and privacy? We have no idea, so that's why we
decided to put public relations in the spotlight this week. Ed
Miliband has not just got to cope with being a new dad, but also with
pressure from the press to make an honest woman of his partner. Who
said romance was dead? Talking of public love stories, George Bush
this week revealed the depth of his romance with our very own political
love machine Tony Blair. Geller began to wonder how you know that,
George expo image... It is refreshing to see love in the air.
Maybe they should all copy David and Victoria's recipe for love.
Apparently, Wednesday night was always date night in the household,
leaving Thursdays free of course to watch This Week. We are joined by
Seal. Welcome to the programme. Thank you. Tell me, you're part of
a high profile celebrity couple   as you entered this relationship,
did it worry you that your marriage will become kind of public
property? Not really, because I don't think either of us really
thought about it, to any great extent. It is one of those things
that just happened. And I think we grew exponentially as we became
husband and wife. I don't think we gave it a lot of time. Did it get
better as time went on? Did it get better? You mean the marriage....?
There are students watching, so we have to be careful. What I mean is,
being part of the celebrity couple, over time, is it easier to manage?
Yes, I guess it is, but it depends on your attitude. The whole concept
of being a celebrity is just ridiculous. It is absurd, when you
think about it. One minute you're a relatively nobody, and the next
second, you're a celebrity, who everybody recognises. I have never
really come to terms with that, as being the norm. But it is something
which has its benefits. As long as you take everything with a pinch of
salt, you cannot take it too seriously. But you're friends of
David and Victoria, possibly the most famous celebrity couple in the
world, and they have made the celebrity couple almost part of
their brand... I think to some degree, you kind of have to.
Because you can't let the media get the better of you, or the better of
your relationship. Some new kind of have to laugh at it, and the best
way to do that is almost to do what David and Victoria do, where they
can't have embraced it. And roll with the punches. You have to, you
can't take it too seriously. I make a point of doing that, I don't read
anything. That's what Margaret Thatcher used to do, and she was
much happier as Prime Minister. If you're a top politician in this
country, you're not that different in terms of the way you're treated,
as a celebrity. Actually I think there is a difference. As I
understand it, but take David and Victoria Beckham, they do not have
a private moment, they cannot walk down the street, they cannot step
out of the front door. Even if you're a Cabinet minister, much of
your life is private. I would come out of my front door as a Cabinet
minister, and jumped in the ministerial limousine, and 364 days
of the year, there would be no press there. When did you ever go
to Tesco's? Waitrose? Or the Carlton Club? Take care. My point
is that it is very different. Most Cabinet ministers do not have to
have bodyguards, they can go jogging on the road. It's true,
most of them don't. So there you go, it is tougher to be a celebrity
than a senior politician. Yes, on the one hand you could look at it
that way. But on the other hand, you could say, there are so many
benefits that come along with it   we kind of get automatic free
passes into certain things, the best restaurants. If you're looking
for someone to help you with something, if you've got a project
that you're working on, we can pick up the phone and talk to pretty
much anyone. If you're a politician, you only get the limelight when you
have done something wrong. I was thinking about our new leader, Ed
terms of him breathing different air now, in terms of the scrutiny.
He's handling it quite well, I think. But there's only a very few
politicians who are under that level of scrutiny. You guys, I
could not inhabit that world. but you could. It is not like I got
into the music industry, thinking about this aspect of it. You say
you couldn't, but you just do. I think the key is that you do not
really take it too seriously. I think having the kind of family
that we have, our kids stop us from doing that. We all agreed that if
you have celebrity relationships, you do not put private letters into
the public domain. Are we all agreed with that? Absolutely. What
could have possessed him? Incomprehensible. Particularly to
your mother in law. What are you doing these days? I'm over here
promoting an album, I have my sixth studio album, called Commitment,
which I'm promoting at the moment. The new single from that is a song
called, weight of my Mistakes, oddly enough. And that's it. Going
back to Los Angeles next week and getting prepared for the holidays.
We are delighted to have you here, but don't go away. We have got a
quiz, and we would get straight into it. This quiz is about
political placards, as a result of the student demonstrations. Here's
our very own Italian student. Where did that come from? Where Was
Dutch owned? What was the protest? Tiananmen Square? No. I remember
