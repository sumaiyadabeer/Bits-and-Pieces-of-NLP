Hello. Welcome to the Science Centre at Glasgow for the Scottish
Labour conference. It is the last big gathering of the party faithful
before the election, an election that will end in either of tears or
triumph for Labour. There is anything to fight for and victory
can be theirs, said they say. It was one of Gordon Brown's
predecessors Harold Wilson is said a week was a long time in politics.
That same is true today. The past few days have been a mixed bag. A
budget, the party says they are proud of. There have been other
stories that have not hit the headlines just now. Het is how my
colleagues across BBC News have been at reporting the stories this
week. There has been a vote to deselect their MP and Muffet.
Moffit's critics have got the results they have been after for
several years.    and Moffit. There has been a margin of more than 2 1
to remove her at the Labour candidate for the election.
What is new is an MP in saying he is available for hire. In other
words, he is more interested in what he can earn them what he can
do for you.    than what he can do for you. The Scottish government
will have an extra £82 million to spend as a consequence of the
Budget. The Chancellor says the economy is at the crossroads.
Things will get better, but Britain has half its huge deficit within
four years. The job of selling that message in Scotland forced to this
man. This Budget was the right choice for Scotland. The first
national rail strike in Britain for 16 years is going again    ahead.
The walkout will begin after Easter on Tuesday 6th April. The this is
what aware railways could soon look like a. Deserted stations, empty
trains, and network paralysed.    a network. The first day of the rail
strike is also VE Day when Gordon Brown was expected to announce the
date of the election.    is also the day when Gordon Brown was
expected to announce the date of the election. In the campaign the
economy will be the big issue. You can expect to hear a lot on how
Alastair Darling had dealt with the recession and how Labour will
manage the recovery. Instead of the traditional speech, the Chancellor
took a succession of questions from the floor. I had been in the
Labour's party for 57 years.    I have been. When are we going to
claw back the taxpayer's money from the greedy bankers? Of asleep there
is not a family in Scotland that has not been affected by the
current financial crisis. My question to the Chancellor would be,
is it now time for a maximum wage within the finance sector? I am
just wondering what would be the true economic impact to Scotland if
we did become an independent nation under Alex Salmond and the SNP?
relation to the banks, we have put in place attacks on bankers's
bonuses. It has 14 £2 million, money are used last week to insure
we were able to fund a number of measures to help get growth in the
economy, particularly to help businesses and small businesses. We
also have restrictions on the amount of bonuses that can be
played within the banks in relation to those banks in which we have
shares. We will continue to argue something which I think some
bankers failed to understand, they are living in the same world as the
rest of us. They just have to understand that other people are
pulling in their belts and they should so    show some restraint.
Also, it is important that we recognise that banks should show
restraint. I do think    I do not think a maximum wage policy would
work. A minimum wage is important, something we have done consistently
over 13 years. I went out of my way to insure that as we come through
this, we do have to make difficult decisions, but I did my best to
protect people are moderate and Middle England's. The tax increases
   on a moderate in comes. Over the last three years, people at that
end of the income scale have done well. Those at the top should
shoulder some of the burden. With regards to banking and the
financial industry, Scotland has been through a difficult time.
There are few people at the top Lee Mears and difficult mistakes. It
employs nearly one million people in this country. It is a very
important industry for Scotland and the future of this country. In
relation to the last question, I have always thought that there is
no serious credible argument for Scotland and tearing itself away
from its biggest trading partner. At a time when the rest of the
world is coming together, it seems mad to go it alone and say, we can
be like Iceland. I don't actually think it makes any sense. Iceland
want into the European Union. It wants to be part of a wider
community. We will play our part in making sure that happens. That is
the best way of getting economic recovery for that country. But for
Scotland to be marching in the opposite direction to everybody
else is sheer madness. Chancellor was followed onto the
platform by Douglas Alexander who is in charge of the party's
election policy. I hope you can take the argument on to the streets
in the weeks ahead. We stand on a strong platform. I was in my
constituency yesterday where we have built seven new schools since
I was elected in 1997. Whenever I come to conference I think of a
mender of mine who used to talk about the wrong end of the social
arithmetic. He said we are in politics to help people who are at
the wrong end of the social arithmetic. The opportunities we
are given to people are unimaginably better than they were
13 years ago when after 18 years of Tory government, we had mass
unemployment and under investment in our public services. And my PT
you would be this. Hold your head high. We have nothing to be ashamed
of and everything to be proud of. If you are a Labour Party member,
we fight elections to change lives, not governments. Gordon Brown and
David Cameron come rattling    are battling it out the No. 10, but in
Scotland it is the SNP that Labour wants to see off. Labour claims
that many would prefer a Tory government at Westminster for
entirely cynical reasons. In his speech, Iain Gray revived memories
of his party's of nickname for the SNP without actually saying the
words. Here in Scotland we do not have to wonder what happens when
you let in an airbrushed politician with Photoshop Policies. We don't
have to wonder what happens when you let in someone who will say
anything, any time to anyone just to get elected. No. We have Alex
Salmond. Students and former students, they would have their
loans paid off. Teachers would or keep their jobs. Schoolchildren
would have smaller class sizes. First time buyers would get grants.
None of that happened. The SNP local income tax, not local, not
based on income, but certainly a massive tax on hard working
families. That turned out to have always been a false and cynical
promise. Iain Gray's attack on the SNP was picked up by the Scottish
secretary. The SNP always complain at these conferences and in my
speech is that I never mention them. There, I've done it. One less thing
for them to complain about. The reason I don't mention bent is
because this is an election about a Labour, Tory choice. My friend
George Robertson, the former Secretary for State for Scotland
one said that the Scottish parliament will kill nationalism
stone dead. That has not happened, but my view is that intrude, it is
the SNP that. Separatism in his track. As Iain Gray has shown, the
SNP is a novelty that has worn off. They always put their party before
our country. They are always the nationalists and never the Patriots.
They have so many excuses. Their favourable arc of prosperity has
fallen down. Above all else, Scotland knows that this is a two 
horse race and there are only two ways to get a Tory government. The
straightforward way is to vote Tory, the back door way is to vote SNP.
And the Tories and the SNP are organising their first coalition
talks later this week. It is the first 40 of a budding romance. And
Scotland's message to the SNP is pretty clear. You do not speak for
Scotland any more when you are willing to get back into bed with
If any party members were in need of a pick me up there was a
motivational speakinger on hand, in the shape of the former Deputy
Prime Minister, John Prescott. And he certainly infused the faithful
with what you might describe as Labour's version of old time
religion. Comrades chair, I am delighted to be addressing the
Conference in the election period. And we are going to win aren't we?
Not if you like that, are we going to win? Of course we are. With
enthusiasm. With dedication, and with pride that we have got it
right. In these last 13 years a Labour Government. So that is what
go forth is. It is about campaigning, for a fourth term. Now
some of you remember when we launched this 18 months ago, the
mood was different wasn't it. The members, membership ship wubz down
we had a bit of internal bickering, we were losing safe seats we
shoupbts have lost, both in Glasgow and in Crewe. We are going to get
them back aren't we? It's going to be one of an audience. I have the
Financial Times here. Thursday. Look. Bubble trouble boom and bust.
Do you know what they say? They said was Gordon Brown right to
claim the end of the boom and bust? They said yes he was justified in
claiming for that. So in that economy, Gordon Brown did do what
he kept saying, to end the boom and bust. Of course we have got a
different set of problems now, there is no doubt about it but we
did produce an economy which gave us the lowest inflation, the lowest
interest rate, the greatest amount of growth, record level of
employment, just been talking about, and we achieved that, that was what
achieved by a Labour Government and the bankers used to say if only a
Government could give us a sustainable economy. Well we gave
nem a sustainable economy and they ruined it by greed, greed, greed
and that is the problem that we are now faced with.
The first phase of a Labour government under Tony Blair and
Gordon Brown gave us the press for te and social justice. The second
is a biggest channel. Is a challenge of global, whether
environment or finance. They are the most difficult problems to
solve. Who is man who has a great vision and judgment on these
matters? Gordon Brown. I remember him in the Cabinet constantly
complaining, that he couldn't get financial ministers to make the
reform and global finance, and when he came along with it, they backed
him to the hilt in the end. It was Gordon Brown's commitment, Gordon
Brown's consensus, and consensus is needed in the world of today. Could
you think Cameron could get an agreement on consensus? He can't
get an agreement among the European Tories. He joins an extreme outfit,
basically Nazis almost but he can't get an agreement. And he is the one.
Is from a choice? There is no choice. Well there is John Prescott
was the warm up act. The main attraction was the man who hopes
his days in Downing Street rarnt    aren't drew    drawing toe a close.
The Prime Minister Gordon Brown. I don't med to tell anybody here,
that our country was built on manufacturing. And that its
manufacturing that will drive our renewal. Nanotechnology, plastic
electronic, aerospace, low car been car, that is where we create a
future where people with get decent pay, promotion and prospect. That
is at risk for a Conservative Party determined to reward their friends
in high finance, at the expense of low carbon, high technology
industries which create real job, and will sustain our recovery. The
because the Tories want to scrap the very investment allowances for
corporation tax that a business needs and get, if it invests, if it
invests in growth in order so that the Conservatives can lavish a
massive tax break on banks and corporation regardless of the
volyoum of jobs they create. Their plans for corporation tax which
will have to be discussed in the next few weeks would give the
biggest hand outs to the biggest companies and banks and they would
pay for this by taking most from the manufacturing companys   
companys that are critical to growth in our jobs and economy.
It's a wonderful Tory policy reward the big banks that drove the
recession and punish the industrys that are driving the recovery. And
it is small and medium size businesses in Scotland and round
the country who would be hardest hit by their proposal. If they
scrap the 50,000 annual investment allowances which is rising to
100,000 and that is why the engineering employees federation,
the manufacturing describe the plan to reduce capital tax allowances as
a big problem for manufacturers and called the Tory policy of reducing
general plant machinery allowances a disaster and so let us be clear,
the Tories might have a lot of warm words, for the middle class and for
everyone in our country, but the cold reality of their plans is to
cut your benefit, to cut your frontline services, and to cut your
jobs. The clocks go forward an hour tonight. But if the Conservatives
win, in the weeks to come, the clocks will be going back to bygone
years, when people on middle and modest incomes were abandoned by a
Conservative Government. The Conservative Government that
believed if it wasn't hurting, it wasn't working. The Conservatives
of course, are not alone in waging war on the mainstream majority. Mr
Cameron has in support of his very own high land division. The
Scottish National Party, that talks left, but votes right. Whose
Members of Parliament in Westminster have followed the
Tories through the lobby, in two out of every three votes. Since
2005. It is hardly a surprise, that if they have clubbed together when
both of them are still reeling from the confrontation between their
fundamentalist dogmas, and economic reality. If being wrong was an
Olympic event, even Sir Chris Hoy wouldn't get more bedle    medals
than Alex Salmond and David Cameron. Because at every moment of judgment
the Tories have got it wrong. Wrong on Northern Rock. Wrong on short
selling. Wrong on mortgage support, wrong on tax deferral. Wrong on the
need for global co of nation, wrong on tackling unemployment. Wrong on
absolutely every major question, they would have faced in Government,
and clearly therefore, unfit to be in Government today. Some times I
don't know whether it is George Osborne or Ozzy Osbourne that is
writing the Conservative economic policies.
You know, who will forget the big freeze, when everything
came to a stand still? Nothing moved. Now I am not talking about
the weather, but the Conservatives big freeze, we are facing with an
unprecedented global economic storm, and what did the Conservatives do?
They froze. They are completely canable of responding flexibly,
pragmatically to changing facts and of course they talk about change.
But what sort of change is it, to make reinstates fox hunting a
priority at a time like this. What sort of fairness is
it, when while your top priority is an inheritance tax give away, you
will do nothing to help the poor in our land. And what sort of modern
party says, the response to the crisis of confidence in our
political institution, should be to defend and perpetuate the state us
the Quo and in the year 2010 to defend hereditary peers in the
House of Lords.
You know when it comes to big change, the Tories have made only
one. Not a change in policy, but a change this week this their
advertising agency. Changing their appearance to give the appearance
of change. They have gone not for better policy bus better    poster,
this isn't change you can believe in, it is the same old Torys from
the same old party. So friend, the time has come, for
the country to weigh up the choice. Who do you trust with our
children's tomorrow? Who do you trust with our nation's tomorrow?
Who do you trust to give us all a better tomorrow? All through the
good times, and the bad times, through the years of growth, and
the months of recession, when things were easy, and when they
were hard, we always stood up for you, the mainstream majority. And
so I asked this of Scotland and of Britain today, in the moment of
decision that lies ahead, remember one thing. In all the moments of
decision, that have already tested Uggs, we have never left you. We   
us, we have always put you the people first. And I ask you to
stand us with now, for your future, stand us with in the weeks ahead
and know that in the years ahead, we will be right there, when we,
where we have always been, on your side, backing your dream, helping
your family, serving the people. You know, we should remember the
achievements of our movement as the film we saw only a few minutes ago.
Hundred years ago, justice for the people of our country, did not mean
the right of every single man and woman to vote. But we, the Labour
movement, made that change possible. Until 60 years ago, justice did not
mean the responsibility to ensure everyone had descent healthcare.
But we the Labour Party changed that, with the creation of the
National Health Service. Until 40 years ago justice did not mean the
right to be free from discrimination based on race or
gender or sexuality but we the Labour Party changed that. Until 12
years ago justice did not mean the right to work, to ensure everyone
in work had the minimum wage buzz the Labour Party changed that. That
is why I say to you, Labour has been and is the greatest force for
fairness our country has ever seen. So in every step we take, let us be
confident, confident about our achievement, confident about our
basic values, confident about our future mission, confident that we
will also be as we have been in the past, the greatest force for
fairness our country has ever seen. Thank you very much.
Watching over the conference is our
political editor Brian Taylor. And Brian, Labour have been very keen
to make out this election is a two horse race between Labour and the
Conservatives. Yet, here we have seen a lot of time and effort
focused on attacks the SNP, virtually using the old phrase for
tan Tory to describe them, in find we heard Gordon Brown coin the
phrase Mr Cameron's high land division to December cry them. Why
then the apparent contradiction between trying to exclude them yet
attacks them so pour fully. If you want to continue the military
metaphor Gordon Brown wants to clear the ground in advance of the
main battle. Iain Gray the speech was an attack on the SNP and Alex
Salmond. The Labour are pry trying to put this as a fight between
Labour on the one hand and the Conservative tons other and the
Conservatives are keen to do just the same and they try and clear the
SNP out of it and clear the Liberal Democrats, out of it. For Labour
there is a particular reason, they want to make this election a choice,
a choice between Labour and the Tory, a clear choice, because they
know if it is a more complex issue than that, if it becomes for
example a referendum in the public mind, upon the Labour Government
and in particular up on Gordon Brown then Labour are in trouble.
So they want to make it a choice between Labour and the Tories.
in Labour are dubbing Gordon Brown the come back kid, and his speech
today was in some respects the speech of an noeant, rather than
the speech of an incumbent wasn't it? Entirely. It was an operational
style speech. The campaign strategy launched that the conference is
called operation fight back. Fight back. There have been    they have
been in power forer 13 years. What they are fighting against is again
placing David Cameron as if he were the notional incumbent and
suggesting that Labour can fight against that. He was doing two
other things, he was trying to paint the Tories into a corner as
being posh and out of touch and interested only in inheritance tax
while Labour where in favour of the middle class. THAT trying to reach
middle Scotland and middle England. He is doing a second thing which is
trying to revive and reappraise the Conservative record in the '80s and
90s as if he wasifyinging that fight again. Getting angry about
battles in the '80s and 90s if that comes back again. It is about this
Labour versus Conservative. It is the Labour picture they are
projecting and the picture of the Conservatives they are projecting
is the Labour version of what they believe the Conservatives to be.
Looking ahead to the election campaign, how difficult is it going
to be to divorce Holyrood eschew from Westminster issues. Very
difficult because it would be a bold political campaigner who gets
a question about the National Health Service and says nothing to
do with me. They can't mislead and lie to the electorate. The issues
policing etc. What they can do and what they are trying to do is they
say they presenting an overall package to the Scottish people.
Things they would try to do now and the issues they put into their
manifesto for 2011. You might say that is misleading given this is a
UK election not on Holyrood issue, Labour say it is an overall package
for which they are envieting endorsement at this contest. Over
the past few weeks we have been at all the main Scottish Conferences,
and if there is any common theme it is the fact that no one is daring
to from dict the overall election result with any degree of certainty.
