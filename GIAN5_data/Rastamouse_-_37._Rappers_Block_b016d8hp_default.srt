Solvin' mysteries in the neighbourhood
Always there to make a bad thing good.
Them tune there is the wickedest rhythm, for real, boy.
Me can't wait for the big Mouse Splash concert tonight.
What a line up! Da Easy Crew and Missy D duetting with Bagga T.
'Rastamouse. Come in, come in. Are you reading me?
'Message from President Wensley Dale   come immediately.'
Ah, come on, keep up, guys. Whoo! Ha ha!
Wicked! Yeah, man. Coming through.
Easy Crew, thank goodness you come!
Things is bad, me can't deny it cos all them likkle orphans,
them well upset and Bandulu say he not know why.
This morning when they wake up, all them do is wail and weep.
Bandulu thinking that maybe it cos them all had a bad night's sleep.
No worry yourself, Wensley Dale.
The Easy Crew gonna check it out straightaway.
Me sorry to bother you.
We know you practising hard for the concert tonight.
It's all right. Wha' go on?
Well, them orphans were crying when me gave them breakfast this morning.
Them say Bagga T no rap them to sleep last night.
  That is weird.
  So, where is Bagga T?
Me no know. Him just take off. Him nowhere to be found.
Rest yourself, Bandulu. We'll find Bagga T.
The Easy Crew have a nose for clues.
Not in here. What you got there, Zoomer?
Me think it's a page torn from a book with writing on it.
  What does it say?
  It look like a rap.
"Me name's Bagga T Bagga trouble double G
"Me sing for you now Ready? One, two...four."
  That's no right. It no rhyme.
  It no finished. Right, Rastamouse?
We only have the one page
so we not know till we find the rest of the book.
Let's go check outside.
Look, there's another.
"Me rapping was all right Now me feeling so uptight
"How me going to get them skills back
"For the concert this...evening?"
  Me wouldn't have used THAT word.
  Me found another page too.
"When me start rapping The crowd start clapping
"And every toe in the place It start...wiggling?"
That's dread, man!
  Come on, Easy Crew.
  It can't be far now.
Look, Rastamouse. Me found a book.
"Me tell you one thing Me like to wear bling
"And everyone want to hear me...rap?"
  That rhyme is bad, Rastamouse!
  That no sound like Bagga T. But why?
Maybe we should ask him. Look, there he is.
  Where ya been, Bagga T?
  Mmm.
  Why you no rap to them orphans, last night?
  Hmm.
  Why you rip up your rap book?
  Eh...
  So, what go on then, Bagga T?
  What's the matter with him?
  Why he no talk to us?
  Ah, Bagga T talk though his rap.
If he's lost his rap then he not gonna be able to talk.
That's why you can't talk, isn't it, Bagga T?
Mmm.
"Me wanna confess That's right what you guess
"So the answer to the question is..."
Yes!
So that's why you no read to them orphans, last night.
And that's why they were so upset, this morning.
But if you can't rap, then you can't perform at the concert, tonight.
Everyone been looking forward to seeing you play.
Especially them likkle orphans.
Rastamouse, we have to help him get his rap back. Him look so glum.
Something must've happened to make him lose his rap.
Let's go and talk to Bandulu.
Now, what did he do yesterday, Bandulu?
Well, he was getting ready for the concert
so first he went to Ron's to get a fresh haircut.
That's right, him came in yesterday
and me give him a cool haircut for the concert.
Him did me a special rap as a thank you.
  Where did he go after that?
  Him went to the Wash Wash Laundry.
Yeah, he was here yesterday, Rastamouse.
He came to pick up his fresh string vest that me clean for him
especially to wear to the concert.
He was rapping and smiling as he waited for his laundry.
  So, do you know where he went after that?
  To the library.
Yes, he was here and he returned this.
Gasp! His dictionary.
Bagga said he was happy with some new wicked words he found
and he was off to try them out. He rehearse with Missy D.
  Thanks, Reddy.
  Missy D!
Maybe she knows who or what is responsible.
Well done. Practice does make perfect.
That was wicked. Well done, likkle ones.
Yay!
Yo, Missy D, me want to chat to you about...
Bagga T? Me know!
Yesterday, we were supposed to be rehearsing for the big concert.
What happened then?
The orphans were all thirsty after working so hard
so me went to the kitchen to fetch them a nice cool drink.
When me return, me see that Bagga T had shown up
but him looking mighty fretful.
Then him rush out the door and me no see him no more.
  You not know what happened to him?
  Him no say a word.
  Hmmm...
  We back where we started, Rastamouse.
And we still don't know why him lost his rap.
Oh, hello, likkle one.
  Oh. Ah.
Is that so? Thank you.
This likkle orphan have the courage
to tell me what happen to Bagga T, yesterday.
Missy D was finishing teaching the orphans
when Bagga T arrived to practise his duet for the concert.
Bu bu boom, ah!
Me name's Bagga T And me dancing's heavenly
Ba ba boom, ah!
Bagga T was concentrating so hard on his rapping and dancing
that he slipped and fell and landed flat on his bottom.
Them likkle orphans, them no mean to laugh at Bagga T
but all their laughing made poor Bagga sad.
Me name Bagga T Me feel foolish as can be
And now me just want to... Me just want... Me just want to...
Bagga T, what go on?
That is why they were crying, this morning.
Because they knew they upset Bagga T.
  What we going to do?
  The concert is in a few hours.
  We know why him lost his skills now.
  Mmm hmm.
But he we going to make sure he get them back in time?
  Rastamouse?
  Hmmm.
  Rastamouse?
  Shh! He's thinking up a plan.
Mmm. Ha ha! Irie, man!
Greetings. Oh, thank goodness.
Mmm. Oh, that plan do sound proper, Rastamouse.
Me just hope you can get him here.
Bagga T, it's a real pity you can't rap at the concert tonight.
  Huff!
  But even if you can't perform,
you can still help me to make a bad thing good.
  Mmm.
  Right, so me need you to collect Missy D's mic
  and bring it to the concert site. OK?
  Mmm.

Orphans, you all know what you did was wrong, right?
Yeah.
Laughing at Bagga T make him lose him confidence
and that meant his rapping disappeared.
But me know you meant no harm.
