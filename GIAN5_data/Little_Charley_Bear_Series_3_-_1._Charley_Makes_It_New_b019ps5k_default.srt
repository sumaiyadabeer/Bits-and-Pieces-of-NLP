Imagine you could fly a plane Race a car, drive a train
Would you want to...?
Charley? Oh!
Imagine you could sail the seas
Fly to the moon Swing through the trees
Would you want to?
Unbelievable!
With Little Charley Bear There's a friend for you
And with your imagination There's nothing you can't do
  You've got to love
  Yeah!
  Little Charley Bear
  Yeah!
You've got to love that bear.
There you are, Charley!
  You've got to love
  Yeah!
  Little Charley Bear
  Yeah!
You've got to love that bear.
Are you there, Charley Bear?
Charley?
Will you help me call him?
Ready?
Are you there, Charley Bear?
Oh!
Is that you, Charley?
It is you! What are you doing, Charley?
Are all those toys and things broken?
Hold on! Don't throw them away.
Let me have a look.
Maybe things could be kept and reused for something else.
Like that bucket, for instance.
It may have a hole in it
but I'm sure it could be useful for something.
A drum!
Or what about planting a flower in it?
Perfect!
Oh, that old football could be a...a...
Ha ha ha! I was actually thinking of a bowl! But a hat is good, too.
Ha ha! A big tummy!
Hello, everybody, I'm a bear with a big mouth!
Well done, Charley. You're good at reusing things.
Wow, look at you! Cowboy Charley!
Looks like you got a lot of old junk in the back of your wagon, partner.
Where are you headin'?
Moseying along, huh, Charley?
Looks like Nibblit has a sore foot.
Rabbits sure are stubborn around these parts.
There must be something you can do for Nibblit, Charley.
Ah ha! Nibblit can reuse that old broom as a crutch to lean on.
That's mighty helpful, Charley.
Oh, dear. I think Midge needs a new bat. Don't you, Charley?
An old frying pan. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Nice work, Charley. It makes a brilliant bat!
  And a brilliant sound.
Rivet sure has got a tiny cymbal, no good for anything.
Can you help him, Charley?
What are you doing?
Now I get it, you've reused the bottles
so that they become musical instruments.
Ye ha!
Is that your house on the other side of the river, Charley?
And the river is in your way?
How will you get home, Charley?
Do you have something you could reuse to help you get across, maybe?
Just that sheet? That's all you have left?
Oh dear, Charley, it looks like you're stuck.
Nibblit wants to get across too, huh?
You'll just have to both carry on and look for a bridge, Charley.
Charley, what are you doing?
Nibblit needs that, Charley, his foot is still sore.
Charley, you won't get far without any wheels on your cart.
You made a boat to sail across!
You clever bear!
Ha, ha! You've got to love that bear.
You reused everything!
It's amazing what you can do with your imagination. It really is.
You've got to love that bear
You've got to love Little Charley Bear
You've got to love that bear.
