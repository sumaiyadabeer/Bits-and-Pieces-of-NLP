Great! The register is complete.
Shall we do the Club chant?
Yeah!
We love animals, plants and birds.
We love snails and slugs.
Large and small, we love them all.
And we never, ever step on bugs.
Cos we are the Green Balloon Club!
Sky, is there anything you want for Christmas?
  I really don't know.
  There's lots of things I want.
  Me too!
  Cover your ears, Skipper.
  I'm going to get a special dog toy.
  I wonder what she'll get you.
Green Team, Christmas is about more than presents.
Really? Aren't presents part of Christmas?
Yes, but it's important we remember why we give them.
Here.
  Let's have a look at this.
  It's beautiful!
What is it?
  The story of Christmas!
  Some Club members gave it to us.
Will that tell us why we give each other Christmas presents, Sky?
Let's have a look, shall we?
'Once upon a time,'
there were animals that lived in a stable,
in a little town called Bethlehem.
There were goats,
ducks,
rabbits,
and even a baby bull!
They were very happy living all together in the stable.
One special day, the animals were visited by an angel.
Mmm, get ready for a special visit.
Everybody get ready.
Get the stable ready!
Get the manger ready! That is a bed. Mmm.
Because tonight, a very precious baby will be born here.
The animals were so excited at the news  
they'd never had guests before.
They started to get everything ready.
Meanwhile, Mary and her husband Joseph had been told by the Emperor
to travel from their home to Bethlehem.
Joseph had to get their faithful donkey ready to travel.
This is a lovely donkey called Custer.
I'm getting the donkey ready for the journey.
Did you know that all donkeys have the cross on their back?
Donkeys have really big ears.
So they can hear really well.
Come on, Mary, the donkey is ready.
It was a long, hard journey on the rough roads.
Mary was tired because she was going to have a baby.
Little donkey
Little donkey
On the dusty road
Got to keep on
Plodding onwards
With your precious load...
When they arrived in Bethlehem,
it was nearly time for Mary to have her baby.
They tried to find a room to stay in but the town was very busy.
Sorry, no place in the inn. Go and find another place.
Both: Oh.
No, no, no room here   go away!
I'm so tired, Joseph.
  Have you got any room in your inn?
  Sorry.
  We're full. And I'm busy.
  Oh, Joseph!
The animals saw Mary and Joseph coming to the stable.
  And they welcomed them in.
  Baa!
Wow, this is amazing!
Thank you, animals!
It was the perfect place for Mary to have her baby.
In the bleak midwinter
Frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone
Snow had fallen
Snow on snow
Snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter
Long
Ago.
  Is that the end of the story, Sky?
  No.
There's more   we'll finish it later.
The story made me think about the creatures living outside
whilst we're indoors, warm, enjoying our Christmas.
We should think about presents for them.
That's a really interesting idea there, Ant.
We could give the minibeast a bug box like the one me and Jay made.
That'd keep them warm in the winter whilst they hibernate!
You collected red stems from the garden.
Hollow ones so the minibeasts could hide inside.
You put them into a plastic bottle with the ends cut off,
to hang up in the garden.
And you made one with corrugated card.
So the bugs could hide in the holes in the cardboard.
A bug box is a good present to give to your local minibeasts.
What about the birds?
It helps if you can leave some food out for them.
  Oh, and water too!
  Of course! That's important when it freezes.
That's when it gets really hard for them to find water.
You could make a bird feeder like Bill and Jelly.
Bill took the middle out of a grapefruit.
Jelly mixed bird seed with lard to go inside it.
The lard is fat   it's good for birds this time of year.
It helps them to keep warm.
Oh, I just love that bird feeder!
  Thank you so much, Bill.
  It was a pleasure.
It was good fun, I enjoyed it.
Nature Chris made a bird feeder too. But look!
They put their lard and seed mixture into a pinecone.
It doesn't look like a pinecone no more.
Think the birds might like it though?
Yeah!
Pick of the Bunch.
My Pick Of The Bunch this week is the holly.
The holly is an evergreen tree with prickly leaves.
At this time of year, some holly trees have beautiful red berries.
These berries are poisonous to us but birds love them.
Why not leave the berries on the tree as a Christmas present to the birds?
Would you like the next bit of the story?
Yes, please.
  Do you remember what's happened?
  Yes.
Mary and Joseph and the donkey went to Bethlehem.
  They're going to sleep in the stable.
  That's right!
Well...
On the hills near Bethlehem,
the sheep were being herded by shepherds in the fields.
We've been working hard in the cold winter, caring for our sheep.
Sheep have woolly coats to keep them warm in the winter months.
Sheep have round, fat bodies and little short legs.
These sheep have white bodies and black faces.
As the shepherds looked after the sheep,
the angel appeared before them.
Do not be afraid!
I have some very exciting news! Mmm.
Hurry to your stable in Bethlehem
because a very special baby is being born there, right now!
So the sheep and the shepherds set off to find the baby.
As the sheep made their way to the stable,
there were some llamas in a far away field.
These are llamas.
They're members of the camel family.
They have very long necks.
And big eyes.
They have big ears shaped like bananas!
Llamas love to chew grass.
The llamas saw a bright star shining in the east  
they knew it was the sign of a king's birth.
Oh!
Their owners went on the long journey to meet this baby.
They followed the star which still shone in the sky,
all the way to the stable in Bethlehem.
I loved it that Jelly was in the Christmas story.
I loved the big shining star.
  I'd like to make a star!
  Let's make one then.
First...
turn it on the white side.
Then, make it to fold over like this.
And it looks a bit like a mirror   a triangular mirror.
Hello, hello. CAT LAUGHS
Then, open it up again...
and you go over to this side.
  Shall I do it the other way now?
  Yeah.
To make a nice rectangle.
Open it up again.
Then fold it the other way.
  This way.
  Yup.
A nice, shiny rectangle.
It's shiny on this side.
Look, you can see the folds.
What you have to do is, turn it to the white side
and cut halfway through these lines.
So that means not up to right in the middle.
There.
You done?
Now, if you make it the white side up,
you get these bits and make it go into the cracks
so it has pointy edges.
  So, it's a bit like an arrow or an aeroplane?
  Yeah.
  Zoom!
  Ha ha.
This will look very pretty on the top of our Christmas tree.
It will, won't it?
  There.
  There.
What you should have is one plain side and one shiny side.
And what you have to do with the plain side is
get the edges and overlap them so it pulls the sides in.
And get some sticky tape and stick it together.
Do that for all of them.
  Can you help me a bit here, Cat?
  I'll hold it then you stick in on.
  Thanks.
Done it.
They're done! Don't they look great?
What you can do, is overlap it like that,
  so you've got a nice big shining one.
  Let's have a look.
It looks beautiful!
  It'll look better on the tree.
  Yes, there's a big space!
  Would you like the end of the story?
  Please!
Skipper, bed.
So, the shepherds and the sheep were following the star to the stable.
That's right.
  So were the llamas and the kings.
  Yup!
Baby Jesus had just been born.
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed...
So everyone gathered at the stable in Bethlehem.
The shepherds gave him a sheep.
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing
The baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes...
And the kings gave precious gifts to him.
And that is why we still give presents today  
to remember the night a very special baby was born.
Be near me, Lord Jesus
I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children
In thy tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with thee there.
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Thanks for the Christmas story, Sky.
Merry Christmas to all Club members!
  Sky, will you put our star up on the tree?
  Of course!
Hey, I've got an idea for this week's Spot.
Why don't you take a look at the night sky?
On a clear night, there are hundreds of stars to be seen
and even some planets.
At the moment, one of the brightest stars in the sky is,
in fact, a planet  
the planet Venus.
Go on, look at the stars.
See which one you think is brightest.
If you spot a bright star, you can even get yourself a green star!
And if you go onto our website,
you can collect a sticker for your online scrapbook.
First, you'll need this week's secret picture password.
It's either...
..the donkey or the star.
Which do you think, Skipper? The donkey or the star?
Good girl.
The star?
Yes! That's right!
So remember, to get onto our website,
this week's secret picture password is the star.
It looks great, Sky, thanks.
  I think our tree looks perfect.
  Aww.
Maybe we should put our Christmas story under our tree!
Yeah!
I really hope everyone has a very happy Christmas.
All of us, all the Club members, Jelly, Bill, Nature Chris,
  all the animals...
  I'm sorry to stop you.
But we're coming in to land!
And whenever we land...it's...
Time for a song!
A Christmas song!
Grown ups and children
Babies and pets
The more people join us
The happier it gets
They call it Christmas
But let's just call it fun
We all live together
So make sure we get on
You don't need the reindeer
You don't need the snow
Be kind to one another
That's all you need to know
To enjoy Christmas
Every single day
It's such a good, good feeling
Don't let it fade away...
Ha ha, don't let it fade away!
  Ha ha.
  Baa!
Some of us are green
Some of us are blue
Everyone's a colour
And every colour's cool
No need to know the language
No need to know the words
We all sing together
And you will still be heard!
You may sing a carol
You might say a prayer
Christmas is a feeling
Anytime and anywhere
Not just at Christmas
Christmases are fine
Whatever's good at Christmas
Is better all the time
La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
Oh, yes, it's Christmas

Is better all the time
Brothers and sisters
Family and friends
Be good to one another
And Christmas never ends!
You're not just being better
Cos Christmas time is here
Whatever's good at Christmas
Is good throughout the year!
You may sing a carol
You might say a prayer
Christmas is a feeling
Anytime and anywhere
Not just at Christmas
Christmases are fine...
  It's good throughout the year, isn't it?
  Oh, yes.
