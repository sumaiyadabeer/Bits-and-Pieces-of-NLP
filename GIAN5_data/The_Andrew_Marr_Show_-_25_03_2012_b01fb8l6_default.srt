Good news and bad news this morning. Good news is that, if you're a
little worried about the Budget, or planning, or anything, really, you
can tell David Cameron about it personally. One to one. Possibly
even at Chequers. The less good news is that,
according to a Sunday Times sting, published today, it'll cost you
�250,000, something like that. Joining me today for our review of
the Sunday newspapers, no money has changed hands I promise: Tim
Montgomerie of Conservative home website. Ann Treneman,
parliamentary sketch writer for the Times; Tim Montgomerie of
Conservative home website. Ann Treneman, parliamentary sketch
writer for the Times. And the Daily Mail columnist, Sir
Max Hastings. David Cameron, with uncanny
perspicacity, said a couple of years ago that secret corporate
politics. And, before 7am, the Tory treasurer involved has already
resigned, which, given the clocks went forward last night was some
going. It may be, however, that the Budget remains a bigger issue. The
leaks, the cut in the top rate, and the so called granny tax. We're
Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander. Is he
responsible for picking the pockets of pensioners, as one headline put
And, for all the talk of austerity, government spending is still going
Also this morning: What about the young unemployed, of whom there are
now more than a million? It's one of the issues David Miliband has
chosen to focus on, since leaving frontbench politics. We'll hear his
take on that. The former Foreign Secretary still follows
international affairs closely. And we'll be talking about Afghanistan
and Iran too. And: The D Day landings were the
beginning of the end of the Second World War in Europe. Now a new book
tells the remarkable story of how the Nazis were deceived. About
where the operation would take place. It's a tale of dashing spies
and dummy tanks. And its author Ben Macintyre is here, to spill the
beans. But first, over to Naga Munchetty
for the news. Good morning. The Conservatives'
chief fundraiser has resigned, after he was secretly filmed
offering access to the Prime Minister, in exchange for a
substantial donation. The party's co treasurer, Peter
Cruddas, made the remarks to undercover reporters from the
Sunday Times. He's described his actions as "bluster", and said he
deeply regretted any impression of impropriety.
This is a headline David Cameron hoped he would never see again,
wealthy donors try to buy access to the top of government. Gritting is
the millionaire businessman who said he could make it    Peter
Cruddas. 100 Grant is not bird. �200,000. If you're not happy about
something, we will listen to you, and we will put it into the policy
committee at Number Ten. We will feed that back into the policy
committee. A sensational claim. The Sunday Times said it sent in
undercover reporters posing as reporters who wanted direct access
to the Prime Minister. In fact, some of our bigger donors have been
for dinner at Number Ten Downing Street, in the Prime Minister's
private apartment with Samantha. Things will open up for you. It
will be awesome for your business. Your guests will get a photo with
David Cameron. Within hours of that being made public, he had resigned.
He said he deeply regretted what he described as his plastered during
the conversation. Saying:    as his "bluster".
David Cameron that says undue influence over government is a big
problem. In 2010, he promised to deal with the opaque business of
lobbying. It is the next big scandal and a waiting to happen.
Which exposes the cosy relationship between politics, government,
business and money. I am talking There is no claim David Cameron
knew what was being offered during the meeting. What is being
discussed is not illegal, but it is a reminder of what many consider to
be the worst side of politics. Members of the Army are to be
trained to deliver fuel to petrol stations, ahead of a possible
strike by tanker drivers. 2,000 members of the Unite union are
being balloted, on industrial action.
Scenes which the government are keen not to see repeated, blockades
and fears of shortages in 2000 led to panic buying and long queues at
petrol stations. 12 years on, the Unite union is balloting tanker
drivers in a row over safety. It involves 2000 members who work for
seven major fuel distribution companies. The ballot closes
tomorrow and is likely to result in a strike next month possibly over
Easter. Ministers say the training of army drivers will begin next
week as part of contingency planning. Whitehall insists the
strikes if they happen will not lead to a repeat of the fuel
blockades which brought the country to a near standstill. Nevertheless,
they do accept motorists may be concerned in anticipation of
problems ahead. President Obama has arrived in the South Korean capital
Seoul, where he will attend a major nuclear security summit. He'll be
joined by leaders from more than 50 nations, including the Deputy Prime
Minister Nick Clegg. Tensions in the region have increased recently,
after North Korea announced plans to send a satellite in to space.
The US and others say the launch is a cover for a long range missile
test. The former Irish Prime Minister,
Bertie Ahern, has resigned from his party, Fianna Fail. He is being
investigated for alleged corruption, and the party was preparing a vote
on whether to expel him. Mr Ahern said he would fight to clear his
name. The government is being urged to
contribute to the repair and maintenance of Britain's great
churches. A BBC local radio survey has found that many of England's
finest cathedrals are struggling to find the money they need to keep up
their buildings. Church leaders are concerned they won't be able to
meet their running costs, from their own reserves and visitor
donations. That's all from me, for now. I'll
be back just before ten o'clock with the headlines. Andrew.
Thank you, Naga. Now, on to the front pages today.
The Observer has changed its front page. That is the Sunday Times
And a story about soldiers standing by to drive petrol tankers, you saw
that in the news. The Sun newspaper and, this
headline. And a very interesting thing, this offer. The Budget has
increased the tax on hot Prize    pies.
And the Sunday Express. That seemed to be a suspiciously Nelda Lee
photograph! And the Sunday Telegraph, maybe an
even bigger political story in due course.
I think we should probably start with the cash for access story. A
classic, or old fashioned newspaper sting, and I'm glad to say they are
still going on. Another reminder, if we needed one, as much as we
disapprove of our newspapers's Pavia, they mustn't be shackled, so
they can do this kind of staying. What we see in the Sunday Times,
this picture of David Cameron and Chequers, and the idea if you paid
250,000 House, you can perhaps get access to him. The wine should
businessmen give large sums, and less that can buy them access?
will they raise money otherwise? the past, we have had a more
ideological brand of donor. People gave because they were Euro 
sceptics. But now, the party is in power, you get a slightly different
kind of donor, who is not so ideologically committed to the
party but which wants to get closer to the Prime Minister. So, the less
the gap in politics, the more likely the corruption. That is the
danger. How dangerous is this? you look at the Conservative Party
website this morning. There is a donor's club. The �5,000, you have
the opportunity to meet and debate with MPs. �25,000, you meet senior
figures from the Conservative Party. �50,000, you are invited to join
David Cameron and senior figures. The Sunday Times has pulled back
the curtain and showed us what happens in a very vivid way. The
Conservative Party is quite transparent. The difference is,
using Downing Street and Chequers, that is where it moves into a
particularly difficult area. that is damaging? A I wonder if
many people think this is the sort of thing politicians get up to
anyway. In a way, people won't like it but added big it will change our
views of politicians. Only special people who pay that kind of money
can get in there. 80 or 90% of Labour's funding comes from the
unions. I agree, the public won't be surprised but I would think it
is most damaging to the government's reputation for
competence. Once again, that this could be allowed to happen on that
David Cameron's watch. And in the week of the Budget. Let us turn to
the Budget. It will be interesting to see whether this produces
another round of talk about reforming party funding which has
been going on. It will be interesting to see if anything
changes. If, in six months, the actual practice will stop. That is
where David Cameron can get back the moral authority. The Prime
Minister who once and for all resolves this. Talk us through some
of the Budget coverage? The most amazing thing is the acres of words
on it, and I can't find anything positive. It has managed to unite
the country. All of the headlines. I still can't believe he meant it
to be like this, but apparently so. Anyone could have seen this was a
PR disaster, the anything that hadn't been leaked, if anyone ever
says to you, you must simplify your tax dealings. The Budget it is
about theatre, the sums of money are tiny compared with this huge
business of public spending, hundreds of billions, completely
unaffordable, public spending is out of control. Here is this Budget,
this is about political theatre, an opportunity for the Chancellor to
make the country feel better. And, he blows it. I can't understand why
somebody sitting by George, how are these figures going to play with
Middle England which feels it is being kicked by this government.
Like, changes to planning law, wind power, a gay marriage. Why now give
the more to be uncomfortable about? You have picked out this story on
stamp duty. One of the problems with the Budget, a lot of people
don't think the numbers stack up about how much money he will get.
It is obvious, these super rich have better accountants than George
Osborne and they will find new ways to get out of it. No one can think
that the last few days have been good politically in the short run
for the government. George Osborne has made the calculation that this
is a mid term Budget, and he needed to get rid of the 50p tax. Cut
corporation tax. These are the sort of things business has been asking
If this helps, these headlines will be forgotten. I don't care if they
will be forgotten because people do see them as rich public schoolboys.
Do they not think that already? They do, but now even more. Do you
believe in this Budget on points of substance? Do you believe it does
significantly advanced the prospect of getting the economy right?
with you on the fact that the government keeps promising to cut
spending properly in a few more years, like me promising I will
lose weight in a few more years. It needs to be done now in order to
get the problem sorted. official figures show public 
spending in real terms, inflation going up by about 0.5% this year
when we thought it was coming down. I thought it meant austerity
cutting. That means a lot of the cuts are still to come. That's
right, and if it happens now we wouldn't need a tax on hot cakes
and grannies and the other things that caused controversy! Another
story I picked out, Britain's 10 billion pound fiasco about these
aircraft carriers. I was watching these enormous things being built.
Here they are, these aircraft, and now we can't afford the aeroplanes
to fly off them and we will end up with these enormous aircraft
carriers wasting billions of pounds and nobody has dared to say stop,
this is madness. I would like to use a brilliant segue, going from
aircraft carriers to aircraft at Heathrow. You have picked up a
possible U turn on the third runway at Heathrow. One of the defining
features of David Cameron's time of leaders of the opposition was to
fly got the green issue.    flag up. This decision is most popular with
business. I was speaking to someone the other day who was saying that
Heathrow is becoming a nightmare airport for international business
people to come into. I think the government have realised we need to
increase airport capacity. The Liberal Democrats are probably more
committed to opposing a third runway than the Conservatives so I
don't know where this will end up. The Independent on Sunday talks
about RAF Northolt, 13 miles away, becoming the third runway! The road
connections are very poor as well. We should probably move on from the
Budget, enjoyable as that has been. Do you have another story there?
The whole world is about the Budget, but I have this great little story
about the fact that now, bread, which is not being taxed, possibly
the only thing left, but now there is a discussion about what is bread
and what isn't. Is a hot cross formed bread?    bun. A group of
civil servants will have to redefine bread, otherwise the tax
will not work. The European Court judgments in future years, it is a
whole tabloid game. And this is part of the hot pie scandal. Greg
the bakers have been taking quite a hit. All the papers have stories
about this Russian banker who has been shot in the middle of London.
The mystery of two wives comes down on London street. I think this
should be a wake up call about the significance of this huge Russian
community in Britain. Russia is now in the hands of a gangster culture,
which is now seeping into London. I spoke to a central banker a few
weeks ago, asking if it was wrong to be alarmed about what was going
on, he said absolutely not, and London has become the money 
laundering capital of the world. Ministers laugh about this, saying
they buy football teams, but these people are essentially gangmasters
and they are bringing it to London. This is a serious story. This guy
could not go back to Russia, he would be on safer. I said to my old
friend that he should write an investigative walk about the
Russians in the West, and at first he said it was a great idea but
then when he thought about it he said I am not going to do it
because I don't want to die. These people shoot you. Do we want people
like these here? Not much. Sir Michael Spicer, tell me about who
he was in the Conservative Party. He used to be chairman of the 1922
backbench committee, a powerful group of Tory MPs, his memoirs are
coming out and he has the story about how Margaret Thatcher
regretted going into politics because of the impact on her family.
I don't know if we believe it or not, it sounds fascinating claim,
but if you can imagine Margaret Thatcher at home as a housewife.
This is almost unthinkable. believe she might have said it but
I don't believe it is true. In a moment of frustration. Yes, one
moment. He is a classic example of the kind of Conservative you don't
see on the back benches so much these days, the shy Tory who was a
great fixer and had authority on the back benches. Senior
backbenchers used to be people of real significance. Now it has all
changed and they are all identikit Central Office people. I don't
think that is fair. There are some real stars, people who are very
independent. Rebellion is what we want. The art independently minded,
they really are. I like the story in the memoirs about Margaret
Thatcher refusing hairspray because none of it was made in Britain. She
was prepared to go on camera looking a bit wild!
Thank you. The start of British Summer Time has been accompanied by
some summery weather, there are some summery weather, there are
already drought warnings. Let's go to the weather studio. In men in
respect, more of the same. Temperatures more like those of
June than those of late March. We have another one day on the cards
with plenty of sunshine but we have some patches of dense fog once
again affecting Central Scotland and north eastern England. A little
bit cool look across East Anglia and the south east, particularly
around the coastal fringes. The mist and fog burning away as we go
into the early part of the afternoon. Most areas bathed in
sunshine, the exception being the coast of East Anglia. Temperatures
could be 22 across the north east of Wales. Overnight, mist and fog
patches will become thick and dense again across the Central lowlands
of Scotland. Across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire as well. By the time
we get to the afternoon, most will have fine spells of sunshine again.
Temperatures soaring into the high teens if not the low 20s. Just to
give you a flavour of howl unusual this temperature at is, the current
March record is 22.2 Celsius which has toured for over 50 years, and
has toured for over 50 years, and it might go over the next few days.
We know he is earning lots of money and we know he has strong views
about youth unemployment, but we have not seen a lot of David
Miliband since the fight for the leadership.
He takes a lot of interest in foreign affairs, notably the
deadliest of dilemmas to do with Iraq and Afghanistan. Good morning.
Let's start with the big political story of the day, this sting
operation conducted by the Sunday Times. Very embarrassing to have
the exchange, the to and fro with alleged business people wanting to
buy access into Downing Street. The to is a bit more than embarrassing.
The idea that policy is for sale is grotesque. I think David Cameron
will have to publish the list of policies that have been sent from
these dinners and have been sent to this committee, this number 10
committee that has been advertised. In the end he will have to do that,
I would say he should do it now because this goes to the heart of
the relationship of being a party and a government. It goes through
the lines that should exist between party and government. A business
people, including under New Labour, have always sought access to
ministers so what is different about this case? Secrecy, the
crashing of the line between party and government, and something else
because it goes to the heart of the question over whether the Tory
party had changed. David Cameron claimed he had modernised the party.
My own view is that the public didn't believe the Tory party had
changed. The budget provided further evidence that the change
was skin deep. The revelations today go to the heart of the claim
that he can trust the Conservative Party because they got rid of those
bad old ways. Your own party when through some pretty big scandals
back in the day. Is the time finally here when parties have got
to get together and talk seriously about reforming the way British
politics works? There has been no shortage of discussions and debates.
My own priority would be to lower the limit of spending. The less
cash you're allowed to be spent, the less need there is for this
kind of thing. There is also the question of public funding that
goes into parties. My own view is that you can't in these times argue
for that to be increased. You can't increase the tax burden to pay for
more public funding. I also think there is an issue about a single
individual giving so much but that is something that needs to be
worked through by the party. Your view is that it has to formalise
the relationship with the unions, isn't it? The old party structures
don't work any more, in the Tories' or in Labour. In the Labour Party,
we have got to do a better job with engaging with trade unionists, who
we want to be more active in politics. It is a matter of real
individuals. So you want to get off the hook off the block vote and get
on to a mass party? We have got to. I have spent a lot of the last 18
months working on community politics, I have set up a
leadership academy. Some people might think that is ironic, but I
have set it up for community leadership so people can make
change in their own community. That has taught me about government that
engages people in a different way because the truth about Britain is
not that we have an over  centralised state, we have
underpowered communities and I think that is something we have to
address directly. To break that up, we should get into a position where
no rich person pays more than a million pounds no union pays more
than a million pounds, we get away from that centralised funding.
thing about the Labour Party is you have individual unionists, none of
them pay a million pounds. Barons do tend to call the shots.
Yes, I know a bit about barons. I know from my own constituency, the
individual trade unionists who want to make sure their voices are heard
in politics, I think we should go with that, not run against it. It
is about transparency openness. I spend my time working for the
grassroots of the Labour Party. I am as committed today to the Labour
Party as I am when I joined, but I want to make sure it becomes a
sustainable organisation at the grass roots. And yet, it has been
the big union barons who have been able to Grandstand, as you say you
were on a sticky side of that yourself, and that has to change,
doesn't it? If we are talking about the deep suspicion of Conservative
funding on one side, there is still the suspicion about your party.
Balls, Ed Miliband, they are the leaders of the party. They speak
loud and clear about the party. Not given the pace since they got for
what they said about the economy, they should be no doubt that the
people who run the Labour Party are You raise your own position there.
When are you going to come back on to frontline politics? You have had
some time out, you have earned a bit of money. You have looked at
some of the grass roots organisations. You don't seem to
beat somebody whose ambition is limited to be a backbencher.
My ambition is the return of a Labour government. I have to have
the humility to recognise, while a daily soap opera might be fun for
the media, it will not be for the Labour Party. My brother won the
leadership, and I am committed to supporting him. I can best support
him by working at the grassroots. The Shadow Cabinet has its place.
Does that mean you will leave politics? If you are not going, if
you don't have aspirations to play at the top team, are you going to
carry on as a Labour MP? Yes, I represent my constituency in South
Shields. 590 young people have been unemployed for months, over nine
months, it in my constituency... lot of people out there want to
know, they admire you and want to know you are going to stay in
British politics. And you will stand, next election. Absolutely.
You have spent a lot of time looking at the youth unemployment
question, something that has been a long standing quite crisis. Nobody
has come up with an answer. truth is, the current government
didn't invent this problem but have made it worse. Their flagship work
programme helps one in 10 of the Million Youth unemployed. On that
work programme, the success rate is about 20%. So, two in 100 are
getting help from the flagship government programme. I chaired the
commission. There is a structural element. As well as a cyclical
element, it is partly about the recession. It is about education,
motivation, opportunities, and the apprenticeship system doesn't even
advertise. 75% in the increase of apprenticeships has gone to over 25.
A lot of talk has focused on the granny tax, but there is a
dangerous complacency about the young unemployed. Young people say
to me, what hope have I got? That is a challenge to all of us in the
political elite about what are you doing for the next generation? If
you are unemployed for a few years as a youngster, the fact is you
will earn less and work less for the rest of your life. If you were
a government minister watching this, what is the next stage? There is a
notion of compulsion, people should be obliged to go to work for
nothing. If people are offered a job, that is right. But that is not
the issue. 590 youngsters in South Shields looking for jobs. If I were
a government minister, if my party was in government, even if you
accepted the fiscal straitjacket the government has created, we
could do so much more. We know a part time job guarantee, which
would pay the minimum wage and get young people into work and allow
them to do job search on the side, would make a difference. It has a
success rate of 50%. We have to get the apprenticeship system working
for young people. The government have done something good, they are
starting in April a subsidy scheme so 50,000 youngsters will get that.
But the government's figures showed they expect figures to be going
down by 2014. I say, spend on it now. What about withdrawing benefit,
is that wrong? It is a contract. Young people aren't afraid of a
contract. They say, don't give me responsibility if there is no
opportunity. So, if they don't take it, and stay at home, you can take
the benefits. The vast majority don't get benefits. 16 and 17 year 
olds do get benefit. The idea you have this welfare state paying for
the unemployed to live lives of luxury is absolute nonsense.
would like to talk about foreign affairs. The idea get passionate
about it. Going back, he did not seem to be somebody who wants to
step away from British politics. The things which brought me into
the Labour Party, a passion about the potential of this country,
remained. I also have to recognise I must do that in a different way.
I am learning and changing as a person. The world is being
transformed by the minute. Two huge crisis you experienced in
government which have not gone away, Afghanistan, and Iran. Afghanistan,
after the terrible events, it is looking as if we are going to have
to withdraw rather chaotically, different Western governments don't
have the same timescale, the Taleban are going to come back.
Everything you hoped in government is falling away. You are right to
be worried that this will become the forgotten war, only in the
headlines when there is terrible tragedy. And that the danger of a
continued civil war which does damage to our secluded interests,
our legacy of work, I fear things will get worse and not better.
Changing course means putting centre stage the political talks
which are the only way to end this conflict. That can't be America or
Britain. It has to be a United Nations Security Council sanctions
mediator. People will say, didn't I here 10 days ago the Taleban have
said they won't talk to the Americans. The point of an
independent mediator drawn from the Muslim world is he would go around
talking to all sides, the Afghan government, to us, to the different
parts of the insurgency. There is only one way to end the war in
Afghanistan, and that is all of the tribes in the political settlement,
Al Qaeda, out, and the neighbours onside and committed to stability.
Is getting that process working more important than getting our
troops out? They go together. The problem is the debate about the end
date for combat is getting in the wake of the debate over the end
strategy. It seems a strange way to fight a war, having an end date.
The Taleban know that as well. There is unbelievable bravery and
intelligence being shown by our troops, and a tactical gains. But
it has to be a political strategy. Iran, something you are familiar
with. We seem to be in a new phase of greater danger where the Israeli
government is saying, there has been enough diplomacy, very soon
they will have the bomb, and we will at if nobody else does. I see
it fathered a fiddly. I wrote in December I was worried we were
asleep and walking to war. That the drumbeat of war had started. What
happened in Washington last month, in that meeting, was significant.
Barack Obama took charge of the Iran dossier it and said, I am
going to be clear, if Iran gets a bomb, I will take them out. Until
that moment comes, I will make sure a political and diplomatic process
sorts this out. It was a clear warning about his own position. The
game has changed. The Israelis have been told, do not bomb. Rightly, in
my view. The game has changed. We have to discuss what other
conditions in which Iran might actually agree to a cessation of
this military programme. There are conditions. We have to give them
something? What is on the table is a civilian nuclear programme which
can help their economy. If they feel the deal is humiliation, if
they're giving in to the Americans, they will not accept it. In
government, I used to say, stick to the nuclear programme, don't worry
about this additional staff. Now, you need to have the additional
role of Iran and the nuclear question on the table at the same
time. Barack Obama has been clear, the
red line is, weapons. The world should be clear, that is what
America will deliver. And now to Double Cross. Not a
return to Labour politics, but the name of a secret World War Two
committee. Early in the summer of 1944, the ferocious fight back to
drive the Germans out of France began. D Day, on 6th June, was make
or break time for the Allies. Convincing Hitler that the Allied
landings were going to take place on a different part of the
coastline was a ruse that helped win the beaches, and then the war.
Central to that masterful dupe was a group of double agents, the five
D Day spies, who were as eccentric as they were daring. Ben
Macintyre's new book assesses their role, and also reveals for the
first time a shadowy sixth spy whose courage and cunning really
saved the Day itself. A fascinating piece of historical research here.
Just start by giving us a sense of some of these extraordinary
characters? Well, they were without doubt the
oddest military unit ever assembled. Their code names give a flavour.
Treasure, Brutus, Bronx. They included a Serbian playboy, a
bisexual Peruvian girl called Elvira Chaudoir. Another was a
highly strung Russian French woman. And in a failed Spanish chicken
farmer, with a wild imagination. Exotic because they were the kind
of characters on the fringe of continental Europe, able to go back
and forward, be recruited by the German military intelligence.
they had in common they had been initially recruited by the Germans.
Then, were turned by British intelligence to work as double
agents for us. I am not sure whether a particular kind of
character is attracted to this world, or whether the world
manufactures them. The crucial he wrote in your book is a man called
Jebsen, a very slight figure. He is a figure we haven't heard about
really before. Tell us a little? Jebsen is fascinating, a wealthy
playboy, he was Danish by origin but German by citizenship. At the
beginning of the war, he took a job, a senior job in German military
intelligence. He was not an obvious recruit, pro British, a fan of PG
Wodehouse. He looked a little like a Germanic Bertie Worcester. But,
he was recruited in 1943 by British intelligence, and he became our
most senior spy within German intelligence. He began to produce
brilliant information about secret weapons, military production. But,
he was too good. He began to reveal the identities them of the spies
but Germany believed it had operating in Britain. They had all
been turned as well. When they were not picked up, Jebsen made the
obvious deduction they must be double agents, so he was privy to
the D Day secret. Jebsen was a dodgy businessman, burning a
forgery scam for some time. Just apo became very interested in him,
and partly because they suspected he might defect. Six weeks before
D Day, he was kidnapped in a neutral Portugal, drugged, and put
into a tin trunk, given it to Gestapo headquarters. For the
following four weeks, MI5 was terrified that Jebsen might crack.
Had he revealed the D Day secret, which was to try to convince the
Germans instead of Normandy being the land in point, the target was
Calais, had he revealed every single spies in Britain was in fact
a double agent, the Germans would have worked out exactly what was
going on. Tens of thousands of lives could have been lost. But, he
hung on. We don't know what happened to him. We do know a
little bit more about the other characters. Elvira Chaudoir. She
was the bisexual Peruvian. extraordinary. Her father had made
a fortune, much of which she had lost at gambling tables. In 1943,
in France, she was recruited by German intelligence. Came back to
Britain, and turned. And spent the rest of the war writing letters in
secret ink, describing conversations she had never
actually had with Cabinet ministers. And fooling the Nazis. What I loved
about her story was how she ends up. So many end up badly but she
At the end of the war she retired and ran a souvenir shop in France.
Shortly before she died, she ran out of money again, and MI5 sent
her a cheque in recognition of what she had done during the war. Tidied
her over for a happy few weeks in France. Thank you very much.
Central to the coalition is the group sinisterly known as the Quad.
Alongside the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and Nick Clegg, Danny
Alexander sits on the group that runs the government. He was central
to the decisions unveiled in the Budget. Welcome. The granny tax,
so called, was a Liberal Democrat idea way back, are you happy to
take ownership of that? The central story of this Budget are the
massive tax cuts we are delivering, the largest tax cuts in a
generation for people on middle and lower incomes. Of course I will
take ownership of all the measures in his Budget. If we are addressing
ourselves to the question of pensioners, I would say there are 5
million pensioners in this country, and every single pensioner this
year will benefit from the largest ever increase in the state pension.
We announced we are moving towards a single tear pension over the next
few years, another Liberal Democrats commitment. The net
effect on these things, on pensioners, is positive and in the
end we had to make some difficult decisions in this Budget because we
had such a strong focus on delivering big tax cuts for the
working people. And for the people at the top as well. No, you are
wrong about that. Overall, the net effect of this Budget is to raise
five times more from the wealthiest. Can I suggest to you gently you
don't know that, this is guesswork about how individuals and their
accountants will behave over the next few years. There is no where
you can know how much money will be taken after the cut from 50p to 45p.
Those figures are certified by the Independent office for budget
responsibility. They are at estimate. The independent
organisation have to certify the numbers in the Budget book. One of
the things we are doing as a government, alongside cutting taxes
for people on lower incomes, is cracking down on tax dodges. I
think people I have spoken to think that the government which is
finally getting tough on people who dodge stamp duty is a major step
forward. Nobody really knows what will happen. This is a gamble based
on how people are going to behave and how much tax they will pay.
would say that we have had the expert at HMRC, the Office for
budget responsibility, looking at the regional estimate of these
measures. I think in the end, a budget that increases taxes on the
wealthiest overall, it stresses the fact working people are under
pressure at the moment. This government, we are doing our best
to help people in this difficult time. What changed? What I always
said is that now would not be the right time to be cutting the
overall tax burden on the wealthiest, and this Budget is not.
Through things like a tycoon tax, through the stamp duty reforms, we
are effectively introducing a mansion tax on stamp duty dodgers.
We have a new anti abuse rule. We are taking changes which will raise
more overall from the wealthiest. In the context of that, why were
you persuaded that the 50 pence rate should be reduced to 45p?
the context of budget discussions, when we set out our main priority
from the Liberal Democrats point of view going further and faster,
delivering the largest tax cut for a long time, we were persuaded in
the context of an overall package of measures on the wealthy which
raises five times more, when we looked at the independent
assessment which the HMRC had done, that actually said... So you are
sitting around the table, we will accept that if you will accept that.
It is a straightforward deal? discovered when this work was done
that far from the promised millions Labour had said we would get from
this 50p rate emerging, it showed it was not a tax that was working.
We have tried to replace that tax with a number of taxes that well 
worked, getting money from the wealthiest. There is also a
philosophical shift in the tax system, where we want to reduce tax
on people with lower incomes. That is a good direction for the tax
policy to go in, I think. If that is what happens, but nobody really
knows. Can I ask again about the granny tax changes because you can
defend them as a simplification, anomalous this was a major change
in the Budget which was not signalled clearly in the Budget
speech itself. A lot of the anger in the press afterwards was that
there was a sense you wanted to hoodwink people. The Chancellor
signalled clearly we would be doing this. It is a difficult choice in
this Budget. Were you happy with the way it was presented? At the
lewdly. It is a change that is justified. I don't see why someone
who is working at age 26 should have the same allowance as a
pensioner. We are increasing the tax threshold so quickly, and the
other measures such as the largest ever increase in the state pension,
they are quite rightly delivering benefits to pensioners. Perhaps
many pensioners would say the answer is because they have been
dealing with a very difficult climate when it comes to interest
rates and investments are the cost of living shooting up. It may be
that the pension has gone up to cover the cost of living increases
but a lot of people are having a really hard time on low incomes and
they did not expect a budget for fairness was going to hit them with
this. There are an awful lot of people having a tough time right
across the population. The poorest 50% of pensioners do not pay income
tax at all so they will be unaffected. By moving to a triple
lock, we are making sure that the arrangements about the basic state
pension are more generous than they were under the previous government.
Do you regret the serial leaking of aspect of this Budget? In a
coalition government there will be debate, publicly, about the nature
of some of these measures. We were very explicit about the priority we
attached to going further and faster about the income tax cuts,
as Liberal Democrats. He your party was blamed, it was even said George
Osborne had to ask Liberal Democrats aides to leave the room
because he assumed they would go straight to the papers. I have no
idea where these things came from. Most of these discussions were in
the court that you refer to, in the four of us plus one Treasury
official so that is not true. In the end, this country was very
poorly served over the last 30 years by a previous government
which obsessed every day about what was in the headlines and didn't
think about what was right for the country. We spend our time thinking
about what is right for the country, and that is what will stand the
test of time. What do you make of this extraordinary story about
Conservative treasurer with a tariff, offering access to David
Cameron at Chequers? For it is utterly disgraceful. As the prime
minister has said, there is no place for this one acceptable
behaviour. This makes the case for reforming the system of party
funding in this country even stronger. No political party has
been without its problems in relation to this issue. In the
coming weeks, we will be getting round the table to discuss how we
can change the way party funding works to get the big money out of
politics. When the Quad sits down next time, what will you be saying?
This is a matter that is being discussed in the government over
many weeks, something we were committed to in our coalition
agreement, and Nick Clegg is taking forward to make sure we bring
reforms to our political system which means this perception of
people that make large donations, whether they are from trade unions,
that those people should not have excessive influence. Are you sure
you will be able to come forward with concrete clear proposals you
can get through the House of Commons? All parties have nominated
people to take part in this process. There will be a short sharp series
of discussions, and I am hopeful that will yield proposals. These
headlines show the necessity of having reforms to the party funding
system to deal with this taint that donors might be able to influence.
Hallowed do you think the cap could be? The committee on public funding
were talking about �10,000. Where would you like to see it? That is
something I would like to see coming out of these discussions.
The issue that David Miliband raised about how much the parties
spend is important to look at, as is the question of the cap on
donations. All parties have an interest in sorting this out. There
is no prospect of donors influencing public policy but we
have to make sure the system does not allow that perception to arise
either. Thank you. Now the news headlines.
The Conservative's chief fundraiser has resigned after he was secretly
filmed offering access to the Prime Minister in exchange for a
financial donation. Peter Cruddas made the comments, but he has
described his actions as bluster and regretted any impression of
propriety. Danny Alexander said the revelations were utterly
disgraceful. The former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband
said there had been of the lowering of the crucial distinction between
party and government. The idea that policy is for sale is grotesque. I
think David Cameron will have to do publish the list of policies that
have been sent from these dinners and have been sent to this David
Cameron committee or even the Cabinet committee, this number 10
committee that has been advertised. I say he should do it now. The next
news on BBC One is at 12 o'clock. Let's have a look at what is coming
majora for one refusing to reveal her face, we ask about this. We
look at whether football is doing enough, and if we need religion to
create a moral society. A few hefty questions. I'm afraid
that is all we have got time for. Next week I will be speaking to the
