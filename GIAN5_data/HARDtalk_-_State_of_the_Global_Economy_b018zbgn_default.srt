them. In what is being described as a human data error, they sold 2000
to many. Now it is time for The eurozone is fast becoming the
twilight zone. So far too big to fix, far too big to fail. Its
members desperately papering over the cracks. The problem is the
travails of the world's richest economic bloc threatened to
destabilise an already fragile global economy. My three guests
today are all leading analysts of the European and international
picture. How long will the world be Vicky Pryce, and your colleagues,
welcome. The collective wisdom of economists seems to be that the
eurozone will not survive the next 12 months in its current form. Do
you share that view? There is a possibility something will happen
with Greece but I think the political will is there to ensure
that they stay in the eurozone because the implications of them
leaving will be significant for the rest of the countries that are
members of that particular group. It is going to be hard, no doubt, I
think Greece is probably going to default. The haircut that has been
bear, could be almost 100%? write off? Absolutely. Can it do
that and stay in the eurozone? It is not a very big country. I
admit quite a few civilians there would need to be written off up the
cost of letting Greece go in terms of the wider implications are so
great. Because the markets would immediately try and destabilise
Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and so on and possibly some of the
other countries like France. terms of full disclosure, we should
say that you live Greek, but have lived in Britain a long time.   
that you are native Greek. eurozone cannot survive in its
current format. Good politics is not always good economics, good
economics is always good politics. Instead of being driven and set up
on economic criteria, the European policy is all about politics. We
have a mismatch in a whole host of countries that are not similar to
one another trying to remain in the system. Vicky touched on the fact
that we should not underestimate the political commitment to keep
the prospect together. But the politicians within Europe should
not underestimate the economic pain the austerity that is going to be
endured, not just increase but in Portugal, Spain and Italy.    in
Greece. I want to get your view on this idea that Greece could default,
and then despite what Vicky just said, be removed from the eurozone,
without spreading the contagion to the other southern European
countries that are drowning in debt. Could that happen? Could Greece be
gotten rid of and the other southern Europeans be protected?
First, the eurozone will survive. Second, Greece is a serious risk.
There is a significant risk that Greece will have to leave the
eurozone because the other European countries may decide to no longer
provide further funds to Greece. That is the risks, it is not likely
but it is a risk. Greece leading the eurozone would be a major
political. Having said that, the biggest potential risk from Greece
was always the risk of contagion to Italy, Spain and France. As we have
already now got contagion for Italy and Spain, the risk emanating from
Greece has actually shrunk considerably. The eurozone would
survive the departure of Greece. I think it won't happen but if the
test was made, the eurozone would survive. You say we already have
contagion but it could get worse if Greece leaving lead to another
severe loss of confidence in, for example, the sovereign debt of
Italy, Spain or Portugal. Yes, it could. Having said that we already
know what would have to be done. The European Central Bank is not
ready yet to support Italy and Spain, wholeheartedly, but they do
know if the test were to be made they would have to do that and
they're very likely would do it. In that sense it would probably be a
one off serious crisis followed by a serious response from the ECB and
then the eurozone would get over it. There are accusations that some
political leaders in Europe are still deeply complacent about how
serious the place is that we are in right now. I am thinking of your
compatriot, the finance minister of Germany, who said over the new year,
"We will have banished to the dangers of contagion and stabilised
the eurozone within the next 12 months." does anybody buy that?
is very likely to be right. The funny thing is, because the
situation at the moment is unstable, things will come to a head before
the end of this year. Before the end of this year we will know
either or and it probably will be the outcome of the eurozone sell 
out. There will be loads of crisis. The reality is we will have a
single currency area which is not optimum. Jeremy is right, Greece
should not have been in it, but neither should have other countries.
Now where are we? The question is where is the will? Expelling
countries will not get you there. But through the ear the markets
will be looking at the debt levels of some of the other countries   
three the year. Spain, Portugal in particular. But also worrying about
Ireland as well, they also have unsustainable debt levels and
austerity packages imposed on them which are simply unworkable. The
markets will want to see some solution that includes a pass to
including fiscal austerity, but in a sensible way.    A Path. Greece
is relying on that right now. wonders just how divergent the
eurozone can become before everybody recognises it is
untenable. Looking at the economic statistics over the last couple of
days and compare and contrast Germany and Spain. Germany is
managing to conquer unemployment, its unemployment levels have gone
down, 6.8%. The German economic motion appears to the purring along.
In Spain unemployment has gone up to 24% roughly on a seasonal level,
and among youths it is 46%. It is unsaleable. The European Monetary
Union stands for even more unemployment in the periphery
countries    and tenable. Who is highest first?    untenable. Does
the periphery tire of the austerity? Because the austerity
means high unemployment. Or do the markets tire in terms of tying up a
blind less debt? What is your answer to that? What is likely to
happen over the next six months is that the core economies led by
Germany will basically be very hard line. They will want to provide no
further help. They will expect the austerity to be borne by the
periphery countries. The markets would demand higher rates. The
European Central Bank will have to do more. Ultimately if in six or 12
months, the peripheral economies still face another year or two
years of austerity and high unemployment, they will need to ask
themselves if it is a sensible policy. What worries me is where
the peripheral country definition stops. We need to define which
countries we are talking about. You're talking about half the
eurozone right now. At least five countries. If you include Spain and
Italy... You could include France, there was a serious loss in
confidence. France could come into play. That is why we have started
to talk about Greece, the Greek solution is not the issue,
expelling them will not solve the problem. Interestingly, if you look
at what the reforms have been proposed in Italy are meant to
achieve, you could have taken out Greece and put Italy on top of them,
in to change them. If you look at Spain, quite a lot of the rules
apply there as well    in to change. We have ended up with countries in
the eurozone after ten years being more divergent than when they first
entered in. That I think is not a correct description. If we go back
five, six, seven years, what we see is we had in a way the worst
possible euro crisis without a lot of people noticing. Because six or
seven years ago we had the biggest of the eurozone economies, Germany,
in a severe crisis. Germany was the sick man of Europe. Germany
breached the stability package in 2003. Then Germany went for Labour
Party reforms, austerity, after two rough years, Germany emerged as the
new powerhouse of Europe. Germany has shown that with a monetary
union you can reform your economy. This is exactly what we are now
seeing on the eurozone periphery. It is tough but if you persevere
and don't overdo it, Greece is a special case, you will be rewarded
by a much stronger growth. speak as the chief economist of a
private German bank, your assumption seems to be that if only
southern Europe and let's face it, many countries in the European
Union, maybe including France, if only all of these countries would
do as we do, become more German, then the problem would be solved.
It is not more German, it is like Margaret Thatcher in the UK, if
your labour market is rotten, reform it. What you are seeing now
is painful in the eurozone. But in a couple of years the eurozone will
have done the hard work, which Britain and the US still has ahead
of them. Will it? Looking at youth unemployment in Spain of 45%, you
think it is tenable to imagine that they will pile austerity on
austerity in the current climate and not end up blaming Germany and
blaming the ECB, and saying, "This system does not work in a way that
. You need the labour market reform. That is the German experience and
that will be the experience of Spain and Italy. We have half the
story here. Countries need to have changed but it does mean austerity.
We haven't talked about the key issue of growth. There is a
complete lack of growth. You can't expect the Greek economy to become
like the German, it is nonsense. You need change but the best time
to have changed is when you are growing. They can force economies
to change when there is no demand. Britain is outside the euro area,
we are able to set interest rates and fiscal policy to suit. Greece
and the other economies do not have the ability to use their' economic
policy tools as shocked observers because they are tied to what the
court once. Clearly these economies need to change, and I understand
the German perspective, but it is only half the story. You can't
force them to continue to squeeze demand. If companies, people and
governments are not spending you have deep recession and the risk of
depression. Bringing your Greek perspective as well as your
perspective from the UK, looking at the politics, is there a danger
that in the coming months we could see a rise of a dangerous level of
anti German sentiment to put it 4th there is already evidence the
Germans are imposing their few on the rest of the world. As Gerald
said, you cannot transform countries overnight. Germany had to
do this because they had not done it for a long time by comparison to
the UK. Their labour market system was very rigid. It was a noose
around the necks of companies. It was lucky it did reforms when the
rest of the world was still growing so it could be in a good position
when the crisis hit. It is not easy for other countries. But everyone
is implementing those reforms, even Greece. They will take longer,
because these practices are so ingrained and when you have no
growth, politically it is almost impossible. Europe will divide more,
because they dislike what is being imposed from the North. A final
thought on Europe. In Europe, as you have talked about economic and
political challenges, does it end up with a conclusion that for the
eurozone to work there must be full integration, fiscal union, one
Treasury making all decisions for the entire area, something that
even now no politician will talk about. Or do nothing so. Note, the
eurozone does not need a common fiscal policy. Kidneys deficit
limits and then active Central Bank. That is the major difference.    it
needs deficit limits. The European Central Bank needs to do a lot more.
It has done a good job so far. The Germans have not let it to enough.
History shows that currency unions of large sovereign nations do not
survive unless they become a political union. That is what must
happen. If Greece is in danger of leaving, that will make the call
more determined to keep the court to get be. But if we are serious
about the economics of the core, the core would only be five or Six
Nations. The core economies are road be a handful. To keep 17
countries in, and accept structural reform, the court needs to put its
hand in his pocket and found them. But it does not need a single
Treasury. It just needs to allow countries time to reform and help
them. It needs a mechanism with enough cash to be able to intervene
when things look a bit dodgy in some countries and help the banks.
You do not need fiscal union. all have different perspectives,
but there is common ground. You all see the next 12 months, the US 
owned crisis will remain and present complex challenges. This
complex challenges go beyond borders.    the eurozone crisis. To
what extent will the crisis trade down the world economy? It will
drag down the world economy in the first half of the year. But we
should be positive about the global output. Ahead of the collapse of
lemons, the emerging world was better insulated. No one is
separate, but the emerging world is better. There is greater trade and
domestic demand in the emerging economies. China and other emerging
economies have a lot of room for policy manoeuvre. That is not
strictly true. The Chinese have a fundamental problem. Their economy
is cooling but their inflation is higher. That cuts down there room
for manoeuvre. It is possible to pay Day scenario in which the
Chinese economy begins to suffer a hard landing. I certainly agree the
Chinese economy will be calling in the first half of this year. High
energy prices have forced them to tighten policy. India have
persistent inflation, cutting their room for manoeuvre. The Parisian
grave threat is down to 3.5% which is poor by their standards.    the
Brazilian growth rate. In the West, the fundamentals are not good,
policy is Paul. Across the emerging world, the fundamentals are pretty
good, the policy covered is very full, fiscal policy gives room to
manoeuvre and confidence is good. But bottom line, if Europe, the
richest trading bloc, is not buying staff, who are these emerging
economies going to sell to? They can sell to the regions. Japan is
doing reasonably well. Japan's economy is stuck. No, it is sort of
recovering. A lot of trade takes place within Asia. It is not all
dependent on us. We do export to those countries. We do still have,
even though they are slowing down, the brick countries. We have eight
to speed world economy.    BRIC. Higher commodity and while prices
have been one reason for the slowdown in the emerging economies.
This will slow down recovery prospects in the West. That is a
very serious issue that people have not taken into account. Everybody
looks at all prices. They appear to be more inclined to go higher than
Lower. But forecasts differ on this. It brings us back to politics, this
time on a global level. Christine Lagarde has been on this show
several times. In her New Year message she spoke of an escalating
crisis for the entire world and said it can only be truly addressed
if countries and regions all work together. If one thinks of trade
policy and the massive imbalances, if one thinks of the strategic
agreement on stimulating growth across the world, we do not see
real co ordination and co operation. Do you believe it is possible?
do not to seek    need to see global co ordination. The world is
full of risk and Europe going wrong is the biggest risk. But so far it
has not materialise. Risk on that scale induces fear and stops people
investing. This is truly problematic. When the eurozone
crisis escalated late last year, the US economy speeded up a bit. In
China, now that inflation is more under control, the authorities are
moving towards renewed stimulus. There is a lot of good news out
there in the world economy. So far in Europe it has gone sort of wrong,
but not disastrously. Chances are that eventually even in Europe
where we need policy co ordination, policy makers will get it under
control and then the world economy will have a surprisingly good years.
That is the most half full rather than half empty analysis I have
ever heard. Had a decade ago the size of the world economy was 32
trillion dollars. Ten years later it doubled in size. Since this
that is inflation but most is strong growth from emerging
economies. We have seen a shift in economic power from the West to the
East. And to Africa as well, where growth rates are stunning? Asian 
African trade is very high. Economy is in the West can do well. Those
that do well will be those with the cash, commodities or creativity.
America will bounce back quicker than Europe. A fund manager of the
massive pain co funded in the United States said he feels worried
Anstead every day, not just as a fund manager, but as a father of a
daughter, and the world she will inherit stop trade policy makers in
the West can respond to that. We must embrace change and believe the
fundamental outlook is positive. There will beefier in the short 
term because of uncertainty. But the little girl will be richer than
