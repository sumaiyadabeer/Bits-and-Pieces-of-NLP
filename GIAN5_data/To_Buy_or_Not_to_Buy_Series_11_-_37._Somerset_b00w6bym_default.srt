Welcome to your favourite daytime property show, To Buy Or Not To Buy.
Today, we're house hunting in a county famous for producing 156 varieties of these.
Or, perhaps more notoriously, this county is known for contributing to the head spinning 136 million gallons
that the UK produces every year of this.
Sorry about that. So, apples, cider, where on earth could we be?
Welcome to Somerset.
As much as we'd like to spend our day eating these and drinking these,
  we do actually have some work to do.
  And we really have our work cut out.
We have to find three imperfect properties for today's buyers.
But Simon, I hear you cry, you normally find three perfect properties for your buyers.
Let's meet them. All will become clear.
'Yes, today's buyers are newly weds Laura and Tom Hayne.'
'After recently tying the knot, they believe Jonny and I can help make their new life together complete.'
'They're social animals, so where better to sow their seeds and set up home
'than in the villages of cider country?'
'Laura has a passion for interiors, while Tom is a total tool addict,
'spending every waking hour either working as a hard landscaper
'or dreaming of his next DIY project.'
'They have a big renovation idea in their minds, so we have a big property mission on our hands.
'Deep breath. Let's find out more.'
  So, we're looking for a project.
  Yep, definitely.
Yeah. We need to get our teeth into something. It can start with two bedrooms
as long as we can go up, go out, bungalow, it doesn't matter.
We quite like the cottage feel. It's just got more character
and it's not all straight lines. Our house is quite straight lines.
You have to be a perfectionist when you do the work.
  If you've got a cottage, you can get away with it.
  Not you.
  What are you saying?
  Rustic!
  You know what I mean!
  That's brilliant.
  We do like a bit of character.
We're very social. We're always entertaining, lots of barbecues in the summer and friends over.
When you're thinking about the kitchen dining socialising area,
  is it easy for you to communicate that to Tom and for Tom to put that into practice?
  Absolutely.
To be honest, I designed our kitchen that we have at the moment.
I love the competitiveness between these two.
And we have a lot of comments on how wonderful it is.
In fact, a kitchen designer said I could be a professional kitchen designer.
If anyone watching is looking for a kitchen designer, Laura Hayne.
  And her fella could do it for you!
  How much are you prepared to spend on the actual building?
  Er, 250 maximum.
  Yeah. That's really pushing it.
If it's going to be a renovation project,
it'd have to be something spectacular to be 250.
I would say around 230 at the most.
  So, reading between the lines there, let's say 250, yeah?
  Yeah, definitely.
  We have the budget, we have your requirements, are we ready to go?
  We are. See you later.
  See you.
  Good budget. I'm excited about this.
  And we've got Tom the tool man. Brilliant.
It's about the couple. I think both of them are really looking forward to getting stuck into this project.
This is my forte. Old derelict properties, there's nothing I don't know. You can take the day off.
  Ah. Like this, is it?
  Yeah.
  Cos I was an estate agent, I don't know anything about refurbing properties.
This is about getting your hands dirty and knocking stuff down,
not walking round with a pad going, "Ooh, dual aspect, integrated appliances."
  Touche, Mr O'Brien. Challenge accepted. See you in a while.
  All right, then.
'Somerset is a county of diverse landscapes, with one national park,
'three areas of outstanding natural beauty and countless picturesque villages.'
'Willow weaving was traditionally big business here, and though the industry has declined,
'it's starting to make a bit of a comeback,
'with more people opting for a greener life or, indeed, death.'
'One industry still very much alive, though, is cider making,
'with this county having the largest number of registered farmhouse cider makers in England.
'Cider and apples are as much part of this landscape as the flora, fauna and wildlife.'
'But what would Tom and Laura's £250,000 get you in some of the UK's other cider producing regions?'
'In Eardisley, Herefordshire, is this stunning barn conversion.
'All the renovation work is done, so there'd be plenty of time to enjoy this lovely home
'and the great outdoors. On the market for £250,000.'
'Heading south to Kent, in the garden of England is this charming Grade II listed cottage.
'Tucked away up a cobbled passageway, you're welcomed with an original stable door,
'then a lovely lounge, compact kitchen, oodles of character.
'All for £250,000.'
'In Dormston, Worcestershire, this renovation property would get Tom salivating.
'With four rooms on the ground floor and three large rooms on the first floor, the options are endless.
'A bargain at 250 grand again.'
Jonny and I have decided that not only will we compete with properties today,
we are also going to give you some local trivia.
So we're each going to guess an apple. If we get it right,
we read that fact out. If we get it wrong...
  The other person reads the fact out.
  There you go. How you feeling?
No idea. I know what I'm going to call it cos I haven't got a clue.
It's... a red delicious.
  I can't believe it! It is, yeah.
You don't know how lucky that was. The important South Somerset town of Yeovil
is one of the UK's fastest growing regions.
That's a cooking apple, or a brambly apple.
It is a brambly! Good lad! You see, you're not out of this yet.
Somerset is a natural home to free thinking entrepreneurs
and has the highest business start up rates outside London
of 23 per 1,000.
It's a decider, isn't it?
Mm.
After three. One, two, three.
  Cox's!
  It's a Braeburn!
  I could sit and look at these lovely old properties all day. But we better get on with this.
  Yes. Come on.
Property one today, my choice. I've gone old school.
It is, actually, an old school, and it is gorgeous.
If you look closely, you don't get one property, you get two for our renovationers!
There you go. Is that a word? It will do. Beat that.
OK, they're going to have their work cut out at property one. Property two is less demanding.
It's more of a refurbishment than a renovation, but it's in a lovely village with parking and a garage.
And as far as the property itself, well, it's a gorgeous 18th century cottage. There we go.
OK. And the wildcard today. What can we tell you about the wildcard?
Well, if you look at it, doesn't look like there's much to do.
Well, look again. If they want a project, that is a project.
That's why it's the wildcard. Anyway, let's start with my choice.
School's out. No, school's in.
'Property one today is my choice. They wanted a renovation project in a village with a school.
'How about a Grade II listed schoolhouse in the idyllic village of Marston Magna?
'Today, the sleepy village is wide awake with a house alarm. I think it's gorgeous, but will they?'
Right, then, the first choice today is mine. I've brought you for an education in property renovation
to the lovely village of Marston Magna. Do you know it?
  Yeah.
  A little bit, yes.
  Been through it a few times.
Oh, listen to that. Let's just enjoy countryside life.
We've got the church bells, we got a house alarm going off over there.
It's not always like that here! What are you thinking?
  Very nice character.
  Yeah.
  Lovely looking. Potential.
  Love the front door.
  Completely different. I like something different.
  I don't like a doll's house, box house.
  First potential of the day.
  Yeah.
  I like it.
  From here, we don't know how many bedrooms it's got or what it is.
  You know nothing about this place.
  You know nothing about this place.
  You don't know anything about this place.
  No.
  For example, you don't know it comes with this place here, as well.
  No!
  Really?
  No, it doesn't.
  Does it?
  Does it?
  Yeah.
  Oh, right.
  Ahh!
  So take one metaphorical step back.
  What a choice Simon's brought you to.
  It's beautiful.
  And I love the front door. Did I say that already?
  You did say that.
  But look at this place here.
  The windows are amazing.
  It's beautiful.
  Yeah, it's stunning.
  All right.
I hope you won't be alarmed by how much work there is to be done. Take your pick, which one first?
  That one.
  Go on, then! Enjoy!
  History in my ear, that was.
  Is that what that is? Character.
  It's not my knees.
  Hey?
  Needs a bit of work.
Are you joking? Do you remember the chat we had?
  "We're looking for a renovation project." What did she say?
  "Needs a bit of work."
  It's quite a good size.
  Definitely needs something done, I can see that.
I think you'd have to do a bit of jumbling round. These must be solid walls.
Oh, first tap of the day, but it is the only way to find out whether something is solid. Look.
  See? Completely hollow.
  Solid.
  It's a bathroom.
  I wonder if that's the only bathroom.
  I don't know.
Cos I don't know, if it's listed, if you can move things like that.
Even in a listed building, as long as you do it sympathetically,
it is very rare you would not be allowed to move a bathroom from downstairs to upstairs.
  Look at the flagstones!
  Yeah.
  Nice!
  It's got a wood burner.
  Nice fireplace.
  Wood burning stove.
  Hello!
What was that? Did he just say "Barrr?"
Yeah, I mean, it's small. I don't think our sofa would fit in.
That living space isn't the biggest. Fortunately, though, I have a plan. I've got a spare property.
  This must be like the second living room.
  Some sort of dining area.
They shouldn't be too concerned about how the property is defined as it is.
  It does feel quite small, but then this is only one part of it.
  Yeah.
  This is a nice room.
  Oh, it is, actually.
Lovely rooms and exactly what Tom and Laura were talking about. None of the walls are straight.
  Main bedroom.
  That's not a bad size, is it?
Well, that's a big bed, so it's obviously got the space.
  I'm surprised they haven't picked up on the features, like those beautiful gothic windows.
  They're superb.
Go on, that's only one! I don't give you one property, I give you two!
  Get in that one, as well! Enjoy!
  We're going!
You're only halfway round! Keep going!
Oh, gosh. It's quite...
  I actually feel like I'm going into a church.
  You are.
  Wow.
  Nice.
  I'm kind of confused.
Well, there we go. Two houses for the price of one. But what, pray tell, is that price?
  Shall I be the one to tell those two?
  Yes.
A ha, there you are! I wasn't sure which building to look in, I've given you so many.
  What a choice.
  Now, I didn't feel you were completely bowled over by this place. Talk to us.
No. We didn't instantly fall in love with it.
  I do like the character.
  Yeah. I think it's stunning.
I've never looked at windows and doors in that sort of way. So, yeah, it's absolutely stunning.
This building, I think, has more potential than the building which is the current dwelling.
  Yep.
  Yeah, I would definitely say that. This has got so much more character.
With the right permission, and Grade II listing makes it hard, but not impossible,
I don't see why you couldn't come through the side of that building and get yourself a garage.
  Turn that into a garage.
  Flip it round.
  Oh, OK.
  But, not cheap.
  Yeah, not cheap.
  That'd be a very flash garage.
  A lovely garage!
It would be one of the most opulent workshops you'll see.
Up to £250,000 is what you can spend on the building itself.
  Yep.
  Plus additional budget for works.
  Yep.
How much do you reckon for the old schoolhouse?
  I reckon it's over budget.
  Definitely.
  Definitely.
  And I reckon about 285.
  You're optimistic!
  No chance!
  You never know, you might get a bargain.
  You know what, you never know, you might be right.
  You never know.
  You win.
  No way!
  Oh, yes.
Because this place is on the market for offers in excess of £250,000.
  Oh.
  Yeah.
  And, furthermore, it's been on the market some time.
When I hear "offers in excess of" and it's been on the market for some time...
  You can always put an offer in.
  A lot of pressure on me, though, for property two. Want to see how I did?
  Yep!
  Follow me.
'For my choice, we venture to the very desirable village of Tintinhull.
'If Laura and Tom were a little overwhelmed by Simon's choice,
'this project will be less daunting, but still a really good property to get their teeth into.'
Now, before you start looking around, there is only one property with my choice.
I know Simon set the bar high, but we are in a lovely, lovely village.
I'm not sure if you're familiar with it. It's known as "Tintnul" Tin tin hull is how it's spelt.
  But the locals call it "Tintnul."
  Tintnul.
  Excellent pronunciation.
We're on Farm Street. I don't know how familiar you are with the area,
  but there's a primary school just down the road there.
  Yeah.
  And a swimming pool.
  Yeah.
  You seem to know an awful lot about this place.
  Yeah, I actually come from Tintinhull.
  Oh, right. Listen, there's not a shop.
  He knows. He's from here.
  Yeah, but if you go just down the road, three miles, there's a shop.
  I know.
Excellent. The property.
What a beaut. What do you think?
I didn't know this was here.
And it looks very, very pretty. It looks very cottagey and I look forward to getting in it.
You should do. This is a blank canvas in a different kind of way to Simon's,
because it was a shell, one half of the property.
This is definitely more defined, but there is work to be done.
To some people, they'd be projects. To you, they're pastimes.
Just try and feel like you belong here, really. Oh, you do. In you go.
  Enjoy.
  What do you mean?
  He's from here, you know?
  Is that...?
  Yeah! Come on, listen.
Oh, this is unusual. Normally, the stairs would be in front of you.
  Nice fireplace. It's quite a biggish room.
  Yeah, it's a good size room.
It is a huge lounge, that, isn't it?
It is a gorgeous room and it has something I always wanted when I was growing up
  and still want to this day.
  Go on, then.
  A window seat.
Original, strong stone.
It's a good size kitchen. Liveable as it is. It's not how we would want it.
  There's a garden there, as well.
  Yeah.
What I love about this village and a lot of the villages around here
  is that gorgeous local stone. It's almost a mustard colour. I wonder what it's called.
  Like an ironstone.
I know who'll know. Excuse me.
You could get a lot of cabinets in here.
And it would be a dining area, as well.
Never mind the cabinets, I need to ask... You're from here, aren't you?
  From Tintinhull?
  Yeah.
  Yep.
  What's the local stone?
  Hamstone.
  I knew you'd know. I love that kind of fact.
  Is it quarried locally?
  Yeah, there's a place called Ham Hill up there.
That's why it's called Hamstone. It's beautiful. I love the lovely mustard colour. Anyway, cabinets. Carry on.
You'll recall, at the beginning of the show, Simon did say I could have the day off.
Well, that's clearly not worked out for me, has it?
Did you find out what it was?
  Yeah. Weren't you listening?
  Hanstone.
  Hamstone.
  Ham! It's these headphones.
  We're going to...
  Nice size landing.
  Yeah, it is a nice size landing.
I don't know if this is the smallest bedroom. A single bedroom.
In my mind, I'm thinking a nursery or a child's room.
Oh, you are planning for the future again.
So this is another bedroom. What's in here?
  Oh, this is a double cupboard. Oh, yeah.
  Sweet.
Yes, that is probably the biggest of the three bedrooms with the chimney stack in it, fitted wardrobes.
  Oh, it's quite a good family size bathroom.
  Cosy.
  It's got what you'd need.
  Not just any bathroom. Oh, no, this is a...
  Family size bathroom. Thinking of the future.
  There's a lot of space.
  It does seem to be a bit mumbly jumbly.
  Yeah.
I'm not sure if this is the most practical shaped room.
  So shall we go and find out if there's anything more?
  I want to know if there's a garage.
  Yeah.
  Get my tools.
  Let's go.
Well, that went all right.
  Yeah, not bad. Definitely better than I thought.
  Yeah.
  What do you mean?
  From the outside, it looks quite small,
  but when you get in, it's quite quirky. It was deceiving.
  Like a TARDIS.
  The rooms were really spacious.
  Bit of a labyrinth round there.
Really quirky little steps.
  The concern I had for you, Tom, is whether or not it's a big enough project for you.
  No, not really.
I thought the rooms were really good sizes and the location's great.
The kitchen's huge. I could make a really good kitchen design out of that.
  Are you listening?
  Yeah, I'm listening.
  I think the potential inside the house is fantastic.
  Not so sure about outside.
  Not quite enough room.
  Guess the price time.
  Oh, my favourite bit.
  Yes.
  It is cos you're winning.
1 0 up. Your maximum budget, £250,000.
This place is going to auction, worth bearing that in mind. Give us a guide price.
  Guide price.
  You go first.
No way! I'm saying 209,950.
  He knows the area.
  No way!
  Congratulations.
  The guide price on it is £200,000.
  Oh, right.
So they'll be looking for a minimum of that when it goes to auction,
  but the vendors will consider offers before it goes to auction.
So it's still available in a conventional market sale.
  Not a bad price.
  I never win. Not a bad price.
  But what does the wildcard hold in store?
  Ooh, on a day like today, it could be anything.
  It's that way. After you.
  Nice!
'Today's wildcard quite simply inspires me, stimulates me
  'and frightens the living daylights out of me.'
  'It's an absolute gem
'and when Tom says he likes DIY, I really hope he means it.
'A project this big will mean he has many, many evenings and weekends of hard labour ahead.'
OK, Tom, Laura, here we are at the wildcard. Welcome to Leigh.
Now, why is this the wildcard?
First of all, you wanted us to find you a place in Somerset, we've come to Dorset.
  But not too far away, have we?
  No.
  No.
  Still within commutable distance into Yeovil.
We are south of Yeovil.
The village of Leigh, beautiful, peaceful, lovely place.
But the wildcard is this property here. First impressions, please.
  Very, very pretty.
  Nice.
  Yes. Love double fronted. Love it.
  Very handsome looking property, isn't it?
  It's got the really traditional chocolate box appeal.
Perfect balance, perfect symmetry. I feel I was a bit too nice to you with property two.
  There wasn't enough work for you, Tom. You were disappointed.
  Yeah.
  That won't be the case here.
  I look forward to seeing that.
  Don't be fooled by the exterior appearance.
You wanted a renovation project, we promise you, that's what we've given you here.
  Get yourselves in there and get lost in the wildcard.
  Brilliant.
  Goodness.
  Luckily, I'm quite short.
  Yeah!
  It definitely need work doing.
  Slightly.
That is one of the greatest understatements you will ever hear.
Oh, my goodness, this is a very small room.
I wonder what's on the other side of the wall, to see what... What's that?
Well, if she continues tapping those walls, she will find a priest hole.
This is a better size. Big fire space.
Yeah, this is a good size room. I'm interested to see what's on the other side.
This house is so old that on the left hand side of the fireplace, there's a plate,
behind that is a priest hole, the priest could escape up to the first floor bedroom or the attic.
  It's a...
  Pantry.
  A very big pantry.
During the Second World War, this place was a hive of activity.
It was the bakers for the village. It was the local store
and all the American servicemen getting ready for their D Day landings would be buzzing around.
You can imagine how alive the village was.
Did someone actually live here? It's unreal.
So this is obviously the kitchen. It's hard to imagine a kitchen when there's not much of a kitchen here.
Well, come on then, Laura, let your mind run riot.
  Windy stairs.
  Oh, my goodness. Look at the top.
  Not exactly easy to get a wardrobe up.
OK. I mean, it's a good size room, but it's like...
Oh.
  I wonder what that...
  Hello? Ooh!
  The floor feels like...
  It's completely dipped.
  Yeah, it's completely slanted.
  Like those puzzle houses.
With those floors, you couldn't have a bed on casters.
Well, you could, but you'd end up next to the window every morning.
I reckon, thinking about it, it could be actually older. More like 1600s.
  It's looking all right.
  This is another good size room.
  This floor looks a little bit flatter. What's that wall made of? It that just...
  No idea.
I don't know why I keep knocking them cos I haven't got a clue.
Do not worry, most people that tap walls don't know what they're doing.
I don't know if we can go up those other stairs. Let's have a look.
If I know Tom, he's going to want to see what's in the attic space. It's too dangerous. Come on.
There you are! Now then, are we right in guessing we're too late to stop you going in that dangerous attic?
  Been there, done it.
  I knew you would!
But Laura, you haven't had chance, so while we were up there,
just so you know what space is up there. Beautiful.
The original beams, the A frame in the roof. And about two metres head height. So there are possibilities.
  Any other questions?
  Yeah, the garages, do they both come with the property?
You get both garages, which is excellent. This is the first property that gives you that space.
What did you think of the property? There's certainly a lot more house with this place,
but not as much work as you initially think.
Yeah. Very nice. Quirky, Biggest downfall, a house in the garden.
Basically, you haven't got no privacy. It's a nice size plot, but that is a no no.
It just looks like it's taken over half of the land.
Originally, that was actually a smithy for the village blacksmith.
There's always been a building attached to this property, going back 400 years.
Maximum £250,000 to spend on the property.
  Yep.
  How much do you think for this?
  Erm...
  You want to redeem yourself?
  You can go first.
I was going to say 209,950.
  That number keeps popping up.
  I see what you've done there. You just pipped him, it's a bit lower.
  You didn't get it. You're wrong.
  Oh, nice!
Sorry, loser!
  You're thrilled, aren't you?
  Yep, it's your property again.
Yeah!
OK, listen, we've now shown you three very different properties in three completely different places.
You've now got to decide which one you'd like to spend a bit more time in.
  Put yourselves over there, tap your heads together and decide which one it will be. See you in a bit.
  Right.
It's exciting. Three very different renovation projects.
  Which one is it going to be?
  I'm not sure. Should we have a recap?
  Yes.
'Will it be my choice, the Grade II listed school in the village of Marston Magna?
'It's a project all right, but will it be too much homework?
'On the market for offers over £250,000.'
'Or will it be my choice, the semi detached cottage in a village very familiar to Tom.
'It may be the stomping ground of his youth but could he call it home once more?
'He can go back to his roots for £200,000.'
'And finally, today's wildcard.
'I'm not going to lie to you, this is in the village of Leigh.
'I would also not be lying if I said it's a big renovation project
'but certainly has P written all over it.'
'Yes, potential, potential, potential.
'But will Laura and Tom see that? On the market for 230K.
'Oh, we're both winners! They've gone for the wildcard.
'And straight down to business redesigning the house.'
  Yeah.
  That's the sink.
  No, it's not right.
  It is.
  No, it's not. That is actually still the kitchen.
That is the bathroom.
  That's not bad for a first attempt.
  And a good improvement.
Yours makes more sense than mine.
It's definitely an improvement on what it is now.
'Well, Laura's got her work cut out in the kitchen.'
'Yep, and Tom's off to sort out the upstairs.'
  'This is no time to make a collage.'
  'It's a mood board, Jonny.'
  'What's she in a mood for?'
'Oh, looks like Tom's getting down to work.'
'No, it's not, it's Tool Man! Da da da!'
'Tool Man's here but he'll need a sidekick.
'And here she comes, Super Laura!'
  Right, let's really get into the attic.
  No, no, no.
  Yeah!
You've spent a bit more time in the house, but before we talk about that,
  there's something we have to admit. We've told you a lie.
  Yes, we did indeed.
  Because we're in "Lie".
  Yeah.
  Oh.
  It's not "Lee."
  Ah, it's "Lie."
We talked to some locals and we were put straight.
So before you start sending letters, we're sorry. These things happen.
  So, you've spent a bit more time in the house.
  Yep.
We noticed your plans there, getting into some of your style.
  Yes.
  We liked you mood board.
  We had a go. Well, I've got a lot of taste.
  Except for me.
  Exactly!
  Yeah! I went wrong somewhere.
As long as you get other things right, that's the main thing.
I quite like those plans. Nice big entrance hallway,
kitchen's fantastic and getting that landing established upstairs so there's three bedrooms.
Seems as though you're becoming fairly interested.
It's a fabulous house that's got a lot of potential
and it could make a really stunning home.
OK, guys, it's been a fun day, but to buy or not to buy?
Not to buy.
  How did we know that?
  How did you guess that one?
  We're very intuitive.
  At least you told us the truth in Leigh.
  Yeah.
In Leigh. THEY LAUGH
  On that moment, I'm on the top, I'm going to leave. Let's go!
  See you later.
  Thank you.
Well, it's been a delicious property hunt in this golden sunshine,
  but it's not been the gala we hoped for amongst the orchards of Somerset.
  And Dorset.
We've always got our eyes peeled and if you'd like us to help you
get inside a property or two, don't hesitate and get in touch.
Right, where to next?
