The Olympic Games come on a grand scale, so vast only the biggest
pressures, to protest, global in size. Yet the massive is only a
compilation of individuals each with a tale. This is the story of a
small land and our part in the biggest show on earth. Wales at the
Olympics. It's one of the oddities of the
London Games that they start here at the Millennium Stadium in
Cardiff on July 25. It's on obvious Welsh connect but it maibgdz the
general point about the Olympics, the first action, women's football,
Great Britain against New Zealand, then Cameroon against Brazil. Then
men's football. Sport for all regardless of gender, colour or
background. It wasn't always like. That the Olympics were designed for
well to do white men from polite society, men from a castle in North
Wales. A Welsh Gold Medallist amateur to his very core or nearly.
And in this sport, Wales's greatest Olympian ever was not soure at all
and he was from Cardiff docks. Two contrasting tales of winners and
the Welshman who didn't win, didn't become part of this legend. The
cruelty of the amateur code and how that code has evolved to keep a
modern Welshman very much in contention for a Gold Medal. Tom
James at the Games of today just like at the last Games. Gold Medal,
Great Britain, wonderfully done! First, organising the sports of
yesterday. In the 1850s a doctor in rural Shropshire, William Penny
Brookes promoted sport for the good of all. His Wenlock Games are
viewed fondly as a building block of the modern Olympics. There were
spin off Games in Wales. In 1865 in Llandudno. And a rival Goran ever
unifying sets of rules, edging them towards international
sport shrank in the sense of being open to all, a sort of
protectionism had crept in. The spirit of fair play could be safe
guarded only by a certain class. Sports club membership at the end
of the 19th century was almost exclusively for people who could
vote, in other words, people who had property. And people who were
from other classes were very much frowned upon. Baron Pierre de
Coubertin the founding father of the modern Olympics. The much
travelled French nobleman drew on many sources for the Athens Games.
But one sport in particular inspired him. De Coubertin had been
to Wenlock and taken note of the Olympian Games. On the river bank
he found sport set against the back drop of a genteel English garden
party, exactly what he was looking forment during his fact finding
tour, De Coubertin came to watch the racing here at Henley on Thames.
There's been a regatta here since 1839. We could still be in 1839. He
was so impressed with the stewards who ran the regatta, he made them
the model of the International Olympic Committee. There was a code
of conduct here, amateurism was the way, sport through love, not money.
Money was a recipe for cheating, professionalism was a dirty word
and winning wasn't everything. It meant you could only go to the new
Olympic Games if you could afford the time, if you didn't take sport
too seriously. Tales are told of people going on their yachts, on
their boats independently and turning up, sometimes not even
knowing that there was a Games on and then deciding to sign up and
have a go. Then perhaps even come ago way with medals. However scen
tick, the Games grew in popularity. 12 years after Athens they came to
London with one favourite sport going up the Thames, back to the
source of Olympic inspiration, Henley. And it was here that one of
Wales' first gold medals was won by a man raised in a castle in harden
in Flintshire North Wales. Albert Gladstone was the son of a vicar
who went to Eton and then Christ Church Oxford, grand enough. But
the tale grows grander. Sir Albert Gladstone. Fifth barren et,
grandson of William Gladstone, fourth time Prime Minister and one
of the giants of the Victorian age. The castle is still in the
Gladstone family. The four time Prime Minister famously chopped
down trees for exercise. The rest of the family headed for the river,
including Sir Albert's nephew, Sir William. Do you think there's
something about rowing which seized your family at the turn of the
century? I don't know what it was. They were certainly quite a rowing
dynasty. They went to a house at Eton where rowing was very popular.
That's where the success of my uncle Albert and my father began.
If fair play was everything, sport was still a serious business. De
Coubertin had witnessed France's humiliation in the Franco Prussian
war and saw sport for a vehicle for national self improvement and
international cooperation. Meaty stuff. The whole Olympic ideal was
based on muscular Christianity. not quite sure you're being fair to
say that. I mean, it wasn't an imperialistic kind of regime. I
think it was part of the Victorian ideal of sportsmanship, the amateur
spirit, never cheating or trying to bend the rules or anything like
that. Never going in for a competition just to win a cup.
Indeed the Leander crews never practised for more than three weeks.
They were immensely fit men. They came together three weeks before
the regatta, because it was thought thating in more than that would
stink of professionalism. And at the pinkest and poshest of all
rowing clubs that wouldn't do. Leander, Albert's club, and the
Leander eight would be Britain's blue riband crew at the Olympics.
They were known as the old man's eight, there any affection ended.
All that idealism was swamped by a good old fashioned grudge match
with this lot, as the bad guys. Belgian crew came over in 1906 and
1907. They described them as beer swilling, significant ar smoking
Belgians with long hair. They won. They beat the cream of the best
clubs in London and they didn't like it at all. The Olympics were
going to come up in 1908. It was felt something must be done.
mind set changed. They were determined that come the Olympics
that they would get their revenge and they wouldn't allow the honour
of England and Great Britain to sail down the river. So, for the
first time ever, a British rowing crew got together early in the year,
that means April, in fact, and trained right through the summer.
The dastardly practice paid off. The romantic idea of gentlemanly
amateurism was being stretched. There ways Gold Medal to celebrate
for Leander, Great Britain, uncle Albert and Wales before a normal
service of reserve was resumed. Olympics was the great moment.
There's no doubt about that. But he was incredibly modest and so,
anything you got out of him about his rowing success had to be
squeezed out of him. Sir Albert with eight fellow rowers at Eton,
all nine went off to serve in the First World War, only three
returned alive. Albert Gladstone among them, having served with
distinction with the Gurkhas. He went on to become a director of the
Bank of England. Would anything, including the Olympics, ever be the
same after First World War? When it came to the ever so slightly
strange world of rowing, it appeared it wo.    would. In the
1920s another promising rower appeared Jumbo Edwards, known as
Jumbo. His father was the Welsh speaking vicar of west cot Barton.
Jumbo went to Westminster school and here like Albert Gladstone to
Christ Church Oxford. They were, however, very different characters.
Jumbo and this hallowed setting did not go together well. Jumbo soon
had to leave Oxford. His son David tries to explain why. We've never
been quite sure why he left. Certainly he didn't do very much
work. I think maybe it was suggested to him that it was best
if he went down until he decided to do a bit more. The second thing was
his rowing. He won an Oxford blue in his first year but collapsed
during the boat race of 1926. You could be forgiven for not working
hard at Oxford, but not rowing hard? They were neck and neck at
the time. Cambridge went on to win by a good distance. There was hell
to pay. They called him a baby. They wouldn't have him back in the
boat. He was villified. He actually went off to see the doctors and
they checked him over and found he had a bit of a heart default and
shouldn't really have been rowing. Jumbo sought solace, as you do with
a dodgy ticker, in flying. Flying brought him back to Oxford.
wanted to do more flying, so he found that if he got a degree, he
could join the RAF on a university commission. So he decided he'd come
back here again. Take two! The second time round he said he wasn't
going to row, except he did, of course and was selected in the
Coxless pair for the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. He won gold and on
the same day, after one of the Coxless four fell ill, he stepped
in and won a second gold. The lives of the sons of Welsh vicars were
parallel again. Now, like Sir Albert Gladstone, Jumbo Edwards
went off to war, as a pilot in Bomber Command in the Second World
War. Being Jumbo he was soon in trouble. He had an incredible
moment. He was flying a bomber, coming back from a raid. He ditched
off the coast of Cornwall. The rest of the crew died. But his sport
came to save his life, because in an inflatible dinghy he rowed
through a minefield and got to safety and survived the whole
incident. Quite some man. After the war Jumbo took up coaching and did
it his way. He coached Oxford, Great Britain and he coached his
sons for Wales at the Commonwealth Games. He always complained because
I didn't like wearing socks in the boat and because he thought my hair
was too long. How can you go fast if you have got hair that long?
When I was looking at some photos recently, I came across a picture
of the 1932 Olympic four and Jumbo is in what appears to be either
Oxford or Christ Church kit without From the first half of the 21st
century to the war heroes, public school, Oxford and the military,
the classes that safeguarded the spirit of sport. Or where they?
Until Sir Steve Redgrave one at five consecutive Olympics,
Britain's most successful was a water polo player, summer, Paolo
Randelovic, born to working class immigrant parents here. In the
Docklands of Cardiff. What is interesting about his background
days it is reflective of Cardiff at the turn of the 20th century, this
cultural melting pot and people from all over the world coming to
Cardiff, Croatian father, Irish mother. These people, off the back
from working on the docks and it was a very similar environment.
Most people would know who Jim Driscoll is these days and not so
many, Paolo Randelovic. Thanks to an 1878 amendment to the 1846 Baths
and Washhouses Act, local authorities were now encouraged to
build public swimming pools. It might have saved our greatest
Olympian's life. I started swimming and I was quite a young boy, at the
age of five, but I could nuts when because I try to swim in the card
of canals before the corporation plans were built and I was fairly
drowned twice and my mother said, they have built the bath houses,
but the child in and he learnt to swim. A government was encouraging
employers to create leisure opportunities for their staff and
you find a lot of swimming pools being built around the South Wales
valleys at that time. Paulo became the youngest ever player in the
Wales water polo team. He won the first ever Olympic gold in the
water pool and two years later, the second, the freestyle in the
swimming and then he was poached by Weston super Mare, whose town
council wanted to put the resort on the sporting map.. Paulo was set up
in the swimming pool and set up with a pub to run. Why did they
have the greatest swimming and water polo talent in the country?
Was a local authority may be seen the chance to promote the seafront
and appeared by having a good team? My theory was that he was head
hunted. Their rugby players being brought into the town and football
players and water polo players, anything weather was a team sport
that could raise the name of the town. This was straining against
the amateurism so dear to the Olympics and Paulo was also testing
any notion of fair play. Paolo tested any notion of fair play.
They used to get bigger attendances for the water polo matches and he
was a blood sport. He went to see some of the violence as much as the
goals and he was never shy. reputation spread far and wide so
we would have been a marked man. Very hard summer, physical man, he
taught them to play dirty. That is a well known fact. And as the
landlord of the Imperial Hotel, Paulo's approach was the same. Take
no nonsense. There are stories of how he used to rule with an iron
rod, especially when the ferry used to come into the old peer and of
course the Imperial was one of first stops. It is alleged that
when they came in to cause trouble, he would shut the doors and what
sort them out single handedly. Paulo went on to win a water polo
gold at the 1912 Stockholm Games and by scoring the winning goal in
the dying seconds against host nation Belgium, another in Antwerp
in 1920 Four golds in total. It could have been more had it not
been for the First World War. He competed in Paris in 1924 and
Amsterdam when he was 42 in 1928. A career worth boasting about.
not pulling my Trombert because you have to say what you can do.   
blowing my trumpet. I am and the only world in the day, the only
human being in the world that ever represented in six Olympic Games.
That stands up to all of the world, and it is proved that I had six
Olympics. That is a world record and there is another record, I am
the only man in the world in the sprint and the long distance to
have the championship that also stands. Nobody has ever won the
sprint and the long distance. I did that for Wales. He was a great
swimmer who was sunk. He is now forgotten among at polo players of
a certain generation. From 1960 onwards. They could not even tell
you who he is. And yet again, I have friends in Greece who know all
about him and collect his photographs. And here he is again,
on a postage stamp in Guyana. completely forgotten, after all.
Perhaps our greatness Olympian was allowed to slide from memory
because he challenged the sporting system of his time. Privilege was a
gateway to the Olympics for Albert Gladstone and Jumbo Edwards. Not
for Paulo Radmilovic. If he wasn't openly professional, he wasn't
strictly amateur either. Amateurism was one of the great pillars of the
Olympics and could be flexible. Paolo Rudman image, talent spotted
and Cardiff and set up for life through water polo and on the other
said the Bristol Channel. Amateurism could be a rigid Keller.
Will betide anybody in athletics he broke the code, which brings us to
the Wash and denied a place in one of the great epic stories of the
Olympics. The runner who did not make it into Chariots of Fire.
Cecil Redvers Griffiths. CR Griffiths, born in England, but
from an early age raised in Neath. Four years before the famous Paris
Games of 1924, he ran at the Antwerp Games in the 4 x 400 metres
relay and won gold. A medal in safe keeping with his granddaughter.
This is the Cecil griffons living museum. It is wonderful to say that
my grandfather was part of the gold medal winning team and he came
first and this is the original 1920 grand medal. You will see all the
other competitors him. If you want to read that... It is a wonderful
list of people. Guy Butler, Robert Lindsay and two Welsh names. CR
Griffiths and John Ainsworth Davies from Aberystwyth, who would leave
athletics to concentrate on his career in medicine. CR did not stop
running. He was barely 20 at the Antwerp Games and now he grew
stronger and faster. In all, he would win ten titles in official
Welsh Championships. But there was also an unofficial side to racing,
races open to all, and for the winner a cash prize. At the Paris
Games of 1924 it was to be a theme among the British that to have a
coach was unsporting. Professional. What would they think if they
discovered one of their own had once taken money? Antwerp is out of
the way, we enter the second chapter, which is for all the wrong
reasons still a stunning story. What happened? He was going to the
1924 Olympics and was on the way with all those fantastic races and
the Olympics came and he did not get there, he was on the boat and
had his blazer and everything ready. And then it was deemed that in his
youth, somewhere along the line, he had been paid professionally. He
was banned from the 1924 Olympics. What excites a poignant is that he
missed the Games, and it was legendary? Chariots of fire.
Oscar winning film celebrated Harold Abrahams, winner of the 100
metres. And Scotsman Eric Goodall, who won the 400 because. Which   
would Cecil gryphons have been part of this, his favourite distance?
One form, he surely would have. won the British have file and an 25
he won the have file. In 1924, he was at his peak, his times would
indicate he would have won a medal. Amateurism said that Harold
Abrahams was devised by the aristocracy in 1860 is to exclude
undesirables from competitions they were organising. There was no place
in this world for a railway worker from Neath. Such a shame. He has
come under the river, he really has. We are trying to get that rectified.
They eventually, the Olympics would change and open the doors.
Amateurism is now seen as a quaint relic of the past, unimaginable for
today's elite competitors. It is sometimes hard to see any
connection between Olympians past and present. Except they still do
the same thing. Rowers still row, going fast backwards as they've
always done. It's just that for Welshman Tom James, the notion of
not training too hard has been thrown overboard. This is what you
go through to earn a place in the men's four for London 2012. But as
part of this space age preparation, they still come to the Edwardian
tea party on the banks of the Thames at Henley and come down the
course once rowed by Sir Albert Gladstone. The rowing life, has it
changed at all? The people who did this 150 years ago, where they
still do that again? I would hope that they would see rolling in
pretty much the same light, it is the same sport. They race in the
same way, there is a mechanical animals    mechanical element and
things have moved on. They did not have carbon fibre. Obviously, the
difference between amateur and professional is one thing that
would have changed. There was something of the Corinthian spirit,
winning was not that important I'm going pot hunting was frowned upon?
He won what you could. Presumably you don't feel that today? Well, I
think deep down, underneath what you do, when you come to racing,
winning is what you try to do. That is the goal. But you have to be
realistic. We are competing and you don't know the outcome. And there
are so many reasons for doing this. I don't want to upset by
experiences of the Games. reason, as good as any, is to
defend his Olympic title. 5:30pm on the afternoon. This is a date that
will forever be etched on the soles and the lives of the screw. Great
Britain, and the number four.    this crew. The graft goes on,
repetitively, repeatedly. And if this seems dull, the real thing is
not. Steve Williams, starting to move on... He pulls hard. Sir Steve
Redgrave. As he did eight years ago. Were ever you are, scream and shout.
We have to urge the British crew on words... The British are coming!
The British are coming! Australia hanging on. Great Britain are
eating into this. Eating it up, stroked by a stroke. The British
look good! We're going to get it! Gold! Great Britain! Absolutely
amazing! Expectation was high and the execution. Magnificent. What a
perfect day for the British coxless four. The defence of that Olympic
title will be staged at Eton, privileged home water. And some
guiding principles from the old days. To not take it so seriously,
to get caught up in the moment, too excited about the event, that is
when you get overwhelmed and you do not think straight, you don't think
in that competitive way, you don't focus on beating the opposition. It
was a confident race. Those elements have been overwhelmed.
They don't fit that mentality. If anything, I have learnt that I have
to enjoy London, enjoyed the experience but take it as it comes.
Of course there will be a lot of expectation but there is enough
pressure on myself from the country. That is a good thing. Nerves and
pressure are good if you learn to use it right. Use it your best
advantage. Thank you very much. This is one posh Welchman to
another! All these men, from the same pod. Brilliant row worse, and
posh. Some high rolling has cut that link going. Does it matter?
Not if we're winning gold medals. The Auld sound the same when
sharing. Wales will be represented and will be cheering at London 2012.
Whatever the background, honours, riders and women going from lifting
Benz to raising the Olympic bar, which brings us to next week...
What and who forced the Olympics to change. How women rode straight
over the men who opposed their participation in the Games and kept
on riding. And running, even when they shouldn't. A in those days,
dead. And the rise of the Paralympians. Out of the shadows
and into the record books as the greatest. No one had a clue what
the Paralympics meant, there was no media coverage, it was hard to get
into the club and most people's attitude towards disabled people
doing sport was, what? And protest at the Games. Politics at the Games.
And how Welsh stars were there when terror came to the Games. Half a
dozen Palestinian terrorists have climbed over the fence. Dressed in
tracksuits, carrying bags with machine guns. There we were,
