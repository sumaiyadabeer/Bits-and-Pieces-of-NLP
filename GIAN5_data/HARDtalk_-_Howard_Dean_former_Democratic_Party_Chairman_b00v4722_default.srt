kind of confusion would still take place.
The sun have the X Factor story. This shocking story of the
aluminium spill in Hungary. The toxic sludge has now reached to the
Danube. That is the central river in Europe and many countries are
very worried about that. It is an amazing picture. Do you think
Now for a look at the weather. As we head through the rest of the
night, there is going to be a lot more cloud being drawn into the
south. As we head into tomorrow, it will be not a lot warmer. It will
begin with rain through the night. Clear skies to start with. A damp
and drizzly night for many and toning pretty mild after that. 11 
14 degrees. Friday will begin on this grey night. The South west of
England will have a few showers. The breeze comes in from the south 
east. It will be a little bit cooler in those areas, I am afraid.
But the sun will come out as the cloud breaks. 18 21 degrees. On
Saturday, it is set to get even warmer   23 degrees in London and
high teens elsewhere. The weekend will be largely dried with plenty
This is BBC News. The headlines: Lord Hutton says millions of public

Barack Obama failed in his bid to become a transformative President?
The President and his party are on the defensive, hobbled by a weak
economy and high unemployment as they approach November's
congressional elections. My guest is former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, Howard Dean. Will his party pay the
price for too much ambition or not enough?
Howard Dean, welcome to HARDtalk from your home territory in Vermont.
You are a veteran campaigner. Would you admit that the Democrats are
vulnerable? Yes, we are vulnerable. Mostly because of the economy. It
has been that all over Europe. Governments have been thrown out
because someone has to take the blame. Fortunately for the
Democrats, the economy started going south before we were elected.
I think we are in better shape then the Labour Party was before the
British election. Why is it that Barack Obama, who
seemed able to reach beyond party lines, is losing independent
voters? The latest polls show him 13% behind.
There are two reasons: The administration underestimated the
ability of the Republicans to act in opposition. The Republicans
cannot govern effectively although they operate as a strong opposition.
They invent facts that and not so that they sell them very
effectively to the American public. When they get into office, the
facts they invented are not real and then it becomes impossible to
govern. Sorry to interrupt you but you have
already chosen to answer in a partisan way. I was trying to
suggest that Barack Obama had an appeal that went beyond party lines
when he won the presidency and appeared to be able to take many
independent minded people with him, and it no longer seems to be the
case and I am asking why. Republicans have no interest in
bipartisanship whatsoever and they want or need to get back power
whatever it takes. They have no interest in helping in the
President's agenda or an American agenda. They just want their power
back and I think the President underestimated how Washington
worked. The second point is the flipside of that   he hired senior
Washington staff who had a different view of how to get things
done, the old, traditional view of deal making, which did not go over
well with a lot of independents and Republicans who had elected the
President. You have highlighted two mistakes you believe President
Obama and his team made. The Republicans need 39 Democrat seats
to take control of the House of Representatives. Are you suggesting
that if that happens the blame will be at the door of the White House?
It always is. When Ronald Reagan lost a lot of seats in 1982, the
blame went to him, and the same with Bill Clinton later. That may
be the truth but in your opinion, seeing how the presidency has
unfolded, and you have made comments about how he has been
advised by people out of touch with life beyond Washington, do you
believe there needs to be a change in the White House? Three or four
of his advisers have announced they are leaving and he has a new chief
of staff. He is a Washington insider put a much more careful
model of how to do the job. Peter Rouse. Yes, I know him a little bit
and I think he is more open to opinions than some in that group.
It may be easy to blame the advisers but what do you make of
Barack Obama himself, and his vice  president, who has adopted a
hectoring sort of tone towards their supporters? He has said it is
time to stop griping and whining. That is the message from the
President himself! I think that is a mistake. Most of these messages
are very good, and they are: let us not return the car keys to the
people who drove us into this mess. That is effective. Hectoring your
own people is not as effective. I think we will not see more of that.
We have seen plenty of that. When unemployment is at 9.6% and
foreclosures are sky high and when the poor are being drastically
squeezed, you have a President who calls on people to stop groaning!
think he's not telling poor people to stop grinning.    stop moaning.
The problem that his staff failed to recognise is that the
progressive wing of his party is most of the party. It is very hard
right now for the President and very frustrating. But I think we
will hold on to the House and the Senate because the President does
give strong leadership and there is none on the other side, and our
candidates are better than their candidates, because they know more
about the facts. The Republican Party has taken a lurch to the far
right and it is beginning to scare the American people. Republicans
are 20% more enthusiastic about voting then Democrats, according to
the polls I have just seen. Look at what happened in Massachusetts
earlier in the year: the seat of Ted Kennedy went to a Republican.
It was almost unbelievable but it happened because of circumstances
and public anger which has not gone away. I think that is true but
people vote differently in general elections than they do in special
elections. The Democratic Party was caught unawares until it was too
late. Also, the man elected in Ted Kennedy's place is a moderate.
people are angry. The former budget director for Barack Obama pledged
that if the Congress passed the $800 billion of the economic
stimulus, unemployment would not go beyond 8%. Unemployment this year
has been hovering at 9.5% and when people see that they get very angry
that the administration has got it wrong. On your side of the pond, if
everybody had a sixpence for every time a politician said something
like that, we would all be rich and there would be no deficit. What is
making people upset is the uncertainty in the economy and the
fact that things have not got better fast enough. Many things are
being said that are not true and they have not been well countered
by the Democrats. At the end of the day, we have a strong leader who is
personally very popular and I think that will make a difference.
are a Democrat who likes to get out amongst the people and deliver a
populist message. When people look at the administration, that they
see people at the top of economic policy making who have been very
closely associated with Wall Street and economic establishments.
Perhaps the President has not surrounded himself with the right
people to change the weather in terms of the economy. This goes on
on cable television and the papers   people look at things like that.
If things had gone better, everybody would be praising that
economic team if the unemployment rate were better. The performance
of those individuals has nothing to do with the unemployment rate. It
is because the world had a major economic downturn and I think the
President has done quite well in it. Yes, the unemployment rate is very
bad and unacceptable, but we escaped a worldwide financial
collapse and many leaders around the world deserve more credit than
they got and are no longer in office but their countries are
still in a lot of trouble. We must continue on the course we are on,
shoring up economics and getting the banks to behave like decent
corporate citizens. There are many left of centre economists in the
United States who say that the Obama administration has been half 
baked in its response and the economic stimulus was not big
enough. They say you need a second one. And they say Barack Obama has
done things by halves. There is some truth in that in the sense
that he did have inside staff who did not understand that real change
was necessary. Isn't that what I said and you refuted it, saying it
was cable TV talk? You did not listen. The fact is that the
President is still a commanding figure and has captured the
allegiance and affections of the majority of Americans even though
they disagree with his policies. I think a lot of the frustration
would happen anyway. You say he's a commanding figure. You disagreed
with the stance on healthcare reform because you wanted a far 
reaching and stronger reform to deliver universal healthcare. You
told a newspaper: the plan hangs out every Democrat who is running
for office to dry and that includes the President in 2012. Do you stand
by those words? I do stick by those worse. There were policy mistakes
made in the healthcare bill. I think it will make it better, but
the reforms are still in front of us. They are difficult and painful
reforms. There were two big mistakes. The first was did not
have put into effect in 2014. If you allow people to sign up for
Medicare who are under 65, we were    we will have a lot more people
insured. The other was allowed on the conservative Democrats to ride
I am wondering how you can insist that President Obama is still a
commanding figure. If you add the confusion to that about whether to
extend the cuts with some Democrats saying that they should go to the
rich Americans, and others are saying that they should not, if one
looks at the party split on perfectionism and whether there
should be legislation to make it in America, I see a party that is
deeply split, confused and there is not leadership.
You are measuring us by Parliamentary standards   the
leader says this is how high we are going to jump and everyone else
says, yes. In our system, we get elected on our own and decide for
ourselves whether we should go along with it. There is a much more
open debate. That is a good thing for the Democrats. The Republicans
are effective in opposition but could never govern. They never had
this open discussion and dialogue about what the best policy is to go
forward. I consider that to be a strength of the American system.
Maybe the flipside of that is that Democrats are not very good in
government because they fight amongst themselves. Going into the
mid  terms, the Republicans seem to have a simpler core theme. That is
that we need to shrink government radically and cut the deficit, the
national debt, and we need a much smaller government to do that.
They have no plan. They have no theme. No programme.
They do. They have a pledge to America. They are going to cut $100
billion out of the budget every year.
You must be joking. I don't know anybody who has taken that
seriously. The pledge to America is a joke. Name one thing they want to
do to get to their goals. We will be asking plenty of
Republicans that. Looking at what is happening particularly with the
Tea Party movement, the American public is now making cutting the
deficit a number one priority. In the end, they believe that the
conservative movement, which appears to believe in a much
slimmed down government, is more likely to do that than the
Democratic Party. You have left out interesting
polling figures. The Democratic Party in Congress is ranked further
down. The Republican is lower. People do not trust the Republican
Party. They see through the nonsense and do not trust the Tea
Party. Why did you say in September, I
approve of what the Tea Party is doing?
From a political point of view. I also said I do not approve of their
agenda but I approve of the idea of individuals taking power into their
own hands and reassert themselves in democracy. I don't approve of
the racist stuff that some of the fringe people in the Tea Party are
saying. I like the idea that individual Americans matter again.
They feel like nobody is paying any attention. I approve.
I find that fascinating that the architect of the 50 state strategy,
a man who uses the internet and certain political methods to revive
the Democratic Party, is now having to acknowledge, and Bill Clinton
has also done it, that it is the Tea Party on the right of American
politics which effectively is using those tools this time around.
That happens all the time. We innovate and copy. In Washington, I
copied what the Republicans had on their computer because it was more
successful. We copy successful innovations, even from the other
side. There is a free market place for ideas. There are a couple of
things that conservatives have done that have been a failure. But there
have also been some things that have moved into the mainstream.
Charter schools, particularly public charter schools, have turned
out to be mainstream. Public  private partnerships are in the
mainstream. Each side has ideas and brings ideas. They originally start
off on the left or right and many get discarded.
In terms of the two party structure in the US and who may or may not be
victorious in November, let's think of things in a different way. Two 
thirds of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong
direction. The shocking figures from the US Census show one in
seven Americans is now living in poverty. It is the highest it has
been since a generation. Leaving aside the Democratic loyalties,
would you say that two party politics in America is failing the
American people? That is right. Washington is broken.
We have a partisan far right activist group in the Supreme Court.
We have individuals in the House and the Senate that on the
Republican side will not compromise for any reason. They have more
important political agendas than that of their country. You have
Democrats who get weak kneed at the possibility they might lose their
seats and are more fearful of losing an election than losing a
country. The political system is in big trouble and needs some fixes.
The Court is making it harder because they are making ridiculous
decisions such as corporations have the same rights as human beings,
which allows bigger money and more special interest in our political
system. You talk about the Court but I'm
thinking about the way the American economy is organised. Bill
Clinton's former Cabinet member recently wrote a book in which he
detailed the way in which inequality in America is becoming
more and more prevalent. The richest top 1% of Americans are now
responsible for 20% or more of the national income. It is getting more
and more unequal. He says neither Republicans nor Democrat have any
interest in addressing this fundamental problem, which is
harming the American economy. Would you agree?
They do have an interest. The Republicans have no interest
because their view of the world is that wealthy people have to run
everything. You're tempted to go back into the
rhetoric. The Democrats and the Republicans are part of a system
incapable of addressing the problem. We will see about that. There is a
strong wing in the Democrat party who wants to address this. There
are many people in Congress and the Senate who want to address this
problem. Are you suggesting that Barack
Obama and the people around him have been frightened off those
fundamentally important core issues?
I think they are trying to find a middle course between the far right,
now in charge of the Republican Party, and the Democrats, who have
views that are closer to what his views are. They live in a hyper
partisan atmosphere in Washington. When you can't find the middle
ground and one side is not willing to have serious discussions, you
have to do what you think is right and move that dialogue along. Let's
be fair to the President. He was elected to the toughest job on
earth. He has had a success in getting major pieces of legislation
through Congress. The first two years of every presidency can be
difficult. We look forward to the next six.
Despite your confidence, it may be a Democratic President dealing with
a Republican controlled House in early November. In which case, do
you see Bill Clinton triangulating toward the centre to make power
work in some sense? He was trying to work out something
with the deficit. If the Republicans should take over either
chamber, and I think that is unlikely, they will have some
responsibility to government. In the past, some have used their
to be a winning strategy. We will see. We will hold on to the House
choice. When they do, they are going to pick the Democrats in much
more of a way they are showing in the polls at the moment. In the
last week or two, the polls have begun to close again.
Thank you for joining us. We are set to see changes in the
weather through the coming 24 hours. Those changes are already happening
across the southern parts of the UK, with a lot more cloud coming in.
Tomorrow, it will feel quite a lot warmer. In the south, we have a lot
of cloud at the moment. That will spread its way northwards overnight,
with a lot of low cloud around. Tomorrow will begin on an overcast
note, with grey skies from the word go. In the south west corner of the
UK, we will have showers first thing in the morning, many of them
heavy as they drove to their way north west winds. Overcast skies to
greet many across Wales. Down and drizzly across Northern Ireland.   
Clear skies through most of the night, so not as mild. But the
majority of Scotland will start off with cloud and drizzle. Throughout
tomorrow, the cloud will slowly break and the sun will come out.
The wind is the south easterly. That means that western areas will
have the best sunshine developing. 18 21 degrees. In Japan, it will be
dry on Friday for the Grand Prix. Hopefully, the track will be dry.
On Friday night into Saturday, this area of low pressure will come in.
