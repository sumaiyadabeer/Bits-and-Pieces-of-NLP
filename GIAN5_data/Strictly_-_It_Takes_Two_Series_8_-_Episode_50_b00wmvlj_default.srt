team, thank you so much for your Hello and welcome to Friday's
Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two. Coming up. Bruno called it groovy
We set Jared two special challenges. Find out how they got on later.
Saturday nice as he and and Aliona impressed the judges with a goofy
jive. The jive seems a really technical
dance. We are putting a bit of an Austin Powers twist on it, but that
is not going to disguise what we have to do technically.
It is full on. It is fast. It is quick. It has got to be on the beat
here on the last kick section sadly. A little bit light on your feet. It
could have been a little bit bit stronger into the floor, but good
job. Well done. We're aiming for the semis. I just
want to go out and nail it, but unfortunately I had do to a bit of
DIY in order to nail it, but we got some great scores.
Please welcome Matt and Aliona. Thank you so much for coming NI
loved your jive. Can we talk about the back flip because when you were
on there, I thought there is no way and then you did. Whose idea was
it? Well, we kind of talked about it, didn't we? At the start what
moves and we thought we could potentially do.
He said I am not sure, I might have to go to the gym and try it first.
And then after I saw him practising I I was like, "You've got to do
it.". Were you not worried it might go wrong? Yes.
You were more worried than I was, I think.
I couldn't watch it the first couple of times.
It was funny when I was stood there on the desk before I did it
thinking, "What is the next ten seconds going to hold for me.".
Craig, a lot of the judges loved how you got into the goofiness of
the character. When they gave you that red robe   because you really
went for it? That was the week we went to the Outer heb heb Outer
Hebrides. We got the box set and watched the whole lot on the way up.
It was good to get into character. You were totally engrossed.
Were you worried about keeping enough jive content in there or did
you want to have Austin Powers fun? I wanted a balance from the
beginning so I told him, "There is going to be pieces where it is
strictly jive. There is going to be parts of silly stuff." And we put
everything together so it was structured from my point of view.
It was brillian. Let's talk about this weekend.
Yes. Three dances. Yes.
You are filming on a zazillion things.
We have had a good week. It is that kind of thing of saying whatever
happens, we will have had a superb week this time. We have two dance
which are very different. We have the salsa and the tango so they are
at opposite ends so you can get a bit of release from one and you are
really partying and then you do serious stuff with the tango.
What has been your approach, alley Aliona to spend a third of the time
on each? I know how difficult it is to go from one dance to another. I
decided we are going to fully learn the first dance, the salsa for two
days and put that away and two do two days of tango and switch them
back and forward, but learn them separately so he is more focused on
the beginning to the end of each dance which helped him concentrate
more. Do you have a favourite? think it is the tango. Is it?
that classic thing, you join Strictly and the tango is something
I was looking forward to and it is like a proper dance, it is full on
choreography.. It is full on beginning to the end.
Strictly is fun and amazing and it gets to this point where everybody
wants to get to the final. It is not fine to leave this weekend. How
much do you want to still be in? Words can't describe it. We have
given up so much. We have made so many sacrifices. We have come up
against challenges and we're here and it is close to get to the final.
You want to get in there. We want to have a go at the show show dance.
Yes, the freestyle. Yes and Aliona has been practise
ago few things. Guys, good luck.
You are You are staying with me, but thank you very much Matt.
I hope I'm sitting here again. We are about to reveal how you did
in in your challenge. If you could have a go at a dream
job for a day, what would it be? I have always wanted to be a spy
because ever since I was a kid I would see the James Bond films and
growing up with my dad he was a huge James Bond fan. I graph tated
to how being a spy would be and roam around the world and figure
out Government secrets and things like that.
Jared. Yes. I have been intelligence officer
for the last 20 years with the British Government. All right.
Today you are going to be an underdiscover spy with the mission
to prevent a political assassination. Are you up for it?
I'm up for it. You have three objectives today.
You need to get moving right now. We have an informant in a pub 250
meters from your location, he will only be there for five minutes, you
need to get into the pub and get the location of the hitman from him.
Do you understand? Copy, over. OK, get moving.
Have you found the location of the pub, over? I think I have found the
pub with scaffolding out the front. It is on the other side of the
street. I suggest you get on with your
mission and go inside. Over. Jared has just walked into the pub.
He looks pretty natural. How are you doing?
Not bad? I'm fine thank you. I hear you have information been
the hitman? I have a photo of a guy here and he is across the road.
You will find him there. Awesome.
Thank you. I see our guy. He is getting into a
black cab. You have identified the target. It
is imperative you stay with him. OK. On T hey driver, could you
follow that cab in front of us? The target is getting out. I'm
going to wait a second. Stick with it and don't get seen.
All right, my friend. Make sure you get in there and
change your profile. Yeah, good effort.
OK, Jared, nour in the cafe, make sure you get into a position where
where you can see everything that's going on. It is imperative you
photo this meeting. All right. I have the evidence.
Well done. Now get out of there. You generally did really well. You
were very natural. It was a good approach. You You got the photos.
Job done. Today I'm going to score you eight.
Amazing. Please welcome Jared and Aliona again. How was it? It was
amazing. I had the time of my life. It was so much fun.
My favourite bit, hat. And you went, "Good work.". We are here to talk
about the pro challenge. How did you do? I did pretty bad. I am sure
I got lower than Katya. I am sure Watch the screen.
Step on the right note at the right time and gain points.
Miss a step on the wrong note and lose points. Music maestro.
lose points. Music maestro. No. No. This is not my thing. No.
I'm not sure what I'm doing with this, but let's do this. I'm going
to lose, I'm pretty sure I'm going Ah, OK.
I got three Cs is that good? Even though I play the piano, this was
horrific! Dancers brain does not work well
with this. Well quite.
Is all I can say. Before we reveal your scores. Jared, how did you
find the challenge? Well, I hope I did better than that. I don't know.
That's pretty hard to beat! All right. Let's have a look at
your video. I actually play the trumpet so if
you give me the trumpet I'll play That was horrible. This keyboard
really makes me angry. I wish I could do it one more time because I
think I have another way I could have done it and yeah, it was very
difficult. It was just very confusing the way the keys were.
They were labelled, but they wouldn't stay on the same keys,
they would change over to another set of keys. It wouldn't be the
same set of keys and then you have to go over there, and by the time
you go over, the keysI had already played. As long as I beat all the
Wowser! Natalie, who is is a girl, has got
1091. You want to beat her. Wow. Let's look at Jared's score.
Oh dear. But you are not at the bottom I am
afraid. Aliona, are you ready for your score?
Natalie has 1091. That is something to be proud of by
the way. I wouldn't have got zero.
Thank you very much, Jared and Aliona.
Our final five have bid farewell to nine other couples. This weekend,
it is getting harder and harder to Time to say goodbye
Seeing people leave is so hard because like being on Strictly is
like getting a new family. It is very hard especially when you
form a a friendship with whether it is a professional dancer or the
celebrity, it has been really horrible.
Every week the comradery gets even more and more intense, you are more
in it together and it is awful every single week saying goodbye to
somebody. It gives you a sense of horrible
reality that eventually everyone will leave and it is horrific.
If it is not you that you have got to worry about, it is your best
friend or someone that you have grown to love in the last two
months. Each person has shared this journey
so you kind of understand it together. It is coming to an end.
When things end it is always sad. The hardest people to say goodbye
to probably Tina, Patsy and fell lessity because they    Felicity
because they brought a fantastic atmosphere and really gave me
confidence every week. It was hard when my room mate left.
The toughest person to say goodbye to was actually Jimi because it was
a shock and he was so openly showing his emotion and so gutted
about going. It is heartbreaking to see your
friends upset and leaving the competition when it really means so
much to everyone. It is brutal and especially as
we're getting closer to the final. I mean who is it that isn't going
to get the chance of dancing in the final?
Here for a last look at training ahead of tonight's live show.
Please welcome Miranda Hart, Katy Brand and Craig Revel Horwood.
There is mayhem. Normally we're all asleep. Miranda, you are a huge fan
of the series? Yes. What have been your best moments if
you like? There have been a few. Probably Ann's Big Bird routine.
Yes. Brilliant.
It made me bark. It made me bulk.
I cried at Pamela and James' last week and rewound it and cried again.
Did you? Yeah. Sad, wasn't it? It was moving. I
cried, I like a waltz, I cried at Patsy's.
Did you? I was tired.
. I love them all. Katie, what do you like? I was really rather moved
by Pamela's rumba. She never bettered the rumba. I know it was
early on, but there was something viserol, she was, "Nobody puts baby
in the corner." She is alone, but I do like her allot.
But    allot. Which is only only good.
Craigy, the thing a thon, I still don't understand. It is very, very
simple darling. All the couples come on to the floor.
Are they holding hands? They are all all swinging doing a version of
the jive. They can do do lifts   no, not that type of swinging. They
dance, dance, dance and couple by couple they are eliminated by the
judges. We will have a con fab and every 30 seconds names go up and
they are announced off the floor. Each time if you are out first, you
get a point. If you are out second, you get two points until the last
person gets the full five points and that adds to the final score
for them on Saturday evening. is important? It is really, really
important. That's how competitions work,
right? People are eliminated. We can have a look at their
training. I am going to say this out loud. Some is very recent, some
is less recent. First up Scott and Natalie.
Yes, I am looking forward to this because there is always drama, of
course, in Natalie's work and that's what I really love about her
choreography. Scott is going to be able to put
this together well. Already this is looking OK. I don't know when this
is from. It is from Wednesday. His His
trousers are so long. They are indeed, very long.
I am worried about the bowl, oh it is a hat.
I was thinking... It is for tips. They are busking now.
What do you think of Scott and Natalie? Well, I think they are a
victim of their jive success if I maybe so bold because I haven't
bettered their jive. It was so good and I was OK, now what? I have been
disappointed. Katie, I would like your view?
is a bit like a coffee advert. I like it.
I am not sure if I should be ordering something.
Let's have a look at Kara and Artem's rumba.
Craig. Well, I like this couple. She is a real technician which is
great and I have to say they should be good at the rumba, you know it
is a dance of love. It is looking really. She has a lot of spins, it
is well controlled. What are they doing?
It seems a bit too long. I am sure
they will fill that. He has got to be careful because one foot should
remain on the floor at all times and that foot came off the floor
then. Don't be pinicerty.
Couples expert, Miranda, what do you think of them? I think she is
absolutely stunning, Kara. They have got the rumba pressure with
all the hype of them being together.
Is that all true, is it? It might This is their music.
Nice. I'm in advert world even though it is the BBC.
Listening for dolphins. It is a sunset and a couple hugging
on the deck and doing the rumba. Watching a polar bear. Watching a
polar bear? On a cruise? Let's look. We have a picture of
Kara's dress. Are they going to finish it?
Let's look at Pamela and James's paso doble? That's nice and
dramatic. Good skirt action, loving that, very powerful. She looks like
she knows what she is doing. A bit of stumbling. Yes, a nice little la
little little lapels. This is looking good.
She already gets in the mood of the dance in the training room. You can
see she is like that. This is the one I get nervous watching. I get
embarrassed watching this dance. I don't like that stompy step.
So the step isn't called pel? caught in between a real war of
words? We will go through it, darling. We have only got another
two minutes. This is what they are dancing to.
The Battersea Dogs Home version! We are all GaGa obsessed.
Anybody who has gone home wearing their kebab is a GaGa fan.
I am not a GaGa fan. Officially. That's going to be
dramatic. I love watching Pamela. I love it.
She is one of those people that has to resurface after every show.
The bacon. If she does it in a meat dress that
will be a double tick for me. Lamb chop la pels.
Let's have a look... I don't know how serious this panel is.
Serious face. How does that look? He is a bit
troubled in that under arm turn. He has a little bit of hip action
going. Liking it. I think this is going to be good actually.
Yes. You are feeling positive?
feeling very positive. Matt and Aliona, are you loving
their work? He is a technician but doesn't throw himself into it.
He throws himself off things a lot, darling.
Off things. He gets it all right, but he doesn't wow me.
Not dancing with his heart enough? Connecting head and feet and not
heart and feet. Are you Are you talking about the
soul of the dance? Well done. Well done. That's why we have him.
I was talking about the soul of the dance.
This is what they are dancing to. Spinning around
Move out of my way When the dances represent the
lyrics. I hope she is spinning around.
There will be a lot of spinning. We have a a literal view of it.
You like actions? Spinning around, move out of my way.
I am still very much in Browny Brownie camp.
That's a good warm up, head, shoulders, knees and toes.
We have a picture of Aliona's dress. You would look good in that. Thank
you very much. Thank you very much.
You could wear the top and you could wear the bottom.
We could be a pantomime cow. Let's look at Gavin and Katya's
Samba. I love a bit of Samba. Oh, carnival.
Oh, carnage darling, not carnival. No, it is looking lumpy. We have
got to be serious here now. That's not bad,... Bad, but... What's the
problem? He was lifting his toes off the ground. That just shows you
that he is not centred number one. Look at the free arm. The free arm.
The free arm is a mess. What do you want him to do with the
free arm? Place it and thumbs. We know how he feels about thumbs.
Miranda, how feeling about these two? I feel his his thighs are too
big for dancing. They are fine in his personal life. In his
professional dance life... They are in the way. When he tries to do
kicks they are too heavy. This is what they are dancing to.
We are almost out of time. Good!
Craigy, I can't ask Craig this, but which couples do you think are
going to be in the final? Three couples in the final. Miranda?
and Pamela. And?
Katie. Kara,
Kara, Pamela
Kara, Pamela and
Kara, Pamela and Matt.
Kara, Pamela and Matt. Do
