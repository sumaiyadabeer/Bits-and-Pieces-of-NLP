  I'm going to ask Sam and Molly to move in with me.
  No.
  No?
  No!
  My name is Ivan. I'm a blood addict.
  None of us are killers now.
Sure you are.
A job, a wife, and a house full of children.
Well, you can still have all that, can't you?
I can't do it alone. Please.
Save me.
  I think I just moved out of my house.
  Why?
  Because I want to be with you.
Before he was given up to a death he freely accepted, he broke the bread...
and gave it to his disciples, saying,
"Take this, all of you, and eat it..."
This is my body...
which will be given up for you.
When supper was ended, he took the cup and gave it to his disciples, saying...
Where are you?
"Take this, all of you, and drink from it.
"This is the cup of my blood,
"the blood of the new and everlasting covenant.
"It will be shed for you so that sins may be forgiven."
Reverend?
Reverend Kemp? Do you need a lift?
  No. I'm all right, thanks. I've got the car with me tonight.
  "Car"?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you need to work on some new material.
Stop screaming, bitch!
Come on!
Do it now!
Maria?
The window! Go! Come on, leave!
It's going to be all right. It's OK...
'And whosoever eats my flesh...
'..and drinks my blood will live forever.'
Hey.
Hey.
  Come back to bed.
  Look, I'm on an early shift.
  Oh, come on, please. Please.
  Mitchell, I'm gonna be late.
  Look, I know how difficult
and confusing all this must be.
  Yeah.
  Lucy...
  Look...
We will talk about this later.
  I promise.
You know, my darling I can't stand to sleep alone
No sweetheart in the dark to call my own
You're my own, you're my own I can sing it, I can groan
Darkness is a stranger And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, low
Last night's parties and last night's horror show...
Forgive me, Almighty God.
Smiling and whirling and kissing all I know...
Cleanse me of my sins.
Cleanse me, Almighty God.
Cleanse me of my sins and make me holy, Almighty God.
Amen.
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Cos Mama told me
The dream of love Is a two hearted dream...
< Are you having a breakdown or something, is that it?
  No. But I think you might be.
  Oh, how dare you!
Oh, my God, did you just throw that at me?
  It slipped.
  So what are you? Just flinging crockery around like a common poltergeist?
Did you just call me a poltergeist?
Mitchell! Mitchell, listen to this.
This is classic, this is. Go on, say it to Mitchell, go on.
  Say it again, go on. Say it...
  I will if you'd shut up for a millisecond!
  Mitchell.
  Uh huh?
  Sam and I are viewing a house today.
  Ha!
What do you make of that?
He has to view houses, he's moving out.
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, right.
Take his side. You two are just so...
gay for each other.
Annie, I don't understand. I thought you were fine with this.
Come here, you big silly bear.
I was fine with this,
when I thought this was a notion.
  But now you're out viewing actual, proper, non imaginary houses.
  You thought it was a notion?
Yes. George, I didn't think you would seriously go through with it. I thought the moment would just pass.
You know, like when you decided you were gonna wear skinny jeans.
  Skinny jeans?
  That was a private conversation.
  Seriously?
  It was a moment of madness.
No, George. This is a moment of madness.
You can't just move in with someone that you've just started dating. It's...
  Tell him, Mitchell!
  Skinny jeans, George?
Oh, all right, Mitchell. OK. Listen, where the hell were you last night?
I was with Lucy. We, er...
we finally, um...
You know.
  Decided to, em...
  Oh, this is like the problem pages of Just 17.
  You had sex, Mitchell. Sex.
  Yeah.
  That's great, Mitchell.
  Yeah, yeah. It kind of was, actually.
  I'm really happy for you.
  Oh, thanks, mate.
  Oh, it's fine.
  Why don't you two just snog each other?
  I know you don't...
  Just snog each other!
  I don't want him to go either.
  Then don't let him.
  We can't keep him prisoner.
  We do have a cage.
  What?
  Annie!
We will still see each other.
I will visit. I will visit all the time.
Won't be the same though, will it?
Will it?
Yeah. Didn't think so.
I hate it when she does that.
She's right, though.
It's sort of...the end of an era.
I'm not surprised she's upset. This place was our home, you know. Without us...
  ..it's just a haunted house again.
  Us?
You're not going anywhere, Mitchell.
No, I mean, not yet, but...I don't know. I might have plans in the future.
Do these future plans include Lucy?
I really hope so.
Yeah.
  Anyway, I'll see you later, man.
  Yeah.
ORGAN MUSIC Oh, atmospheric!
Welcome, everyone.
I am Alan Cortez, Master Medium, and this is my Psychic Experience.
Welcome, all.
I am Alan Cortez.
I, like my ancestors before me, have been blessed with the unique gift with the ability to...
to contact and communicate with the afterlife.
Prepare to have your doubts silenced and your questions answered.
Prepare to be amazed.
It's really great. Can we just have a little look around on our own again for a minute?
I'll be outside. Take your time.
Thanks a lot, cheers.
I love it. I really love it. And the rent's really reasonable, don't you think?
Considering the size of the place.
And a garden, George. A proper garden!
  Yeah, it's great.
  It's really great.
It's so great. It's so, so, so great.
  And it's available now!
  What?
Now? No, no, as in... Today? Now? As in right here, right now?
Someone else will have moved in by the time you finish that sentence. What's the problem?
Don't you think it's a little far out?
It's, like, half an hour from town.
I tell you what, I'd really rather be a little bit closer to my friends.
By friends you mean Mitchell?
Er, I have other friends.
George, we're moving in together.
A whole new life. Things are gonna change.
  If you're not ready for that then...
  I am.
I am so ready.
I am 100 per cent. I am ever ready.
Let's do it. Let's take it.
  Yeah? Yeah!
  Yeah. Yes!
Yes! Ha ha! Woo hoo!
Oh, Molly.
We should get a dog. We should get a dog! A small dog!
Ha ha! Woo hoo! Molly! High five!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't strong enough. I thought I was.
I thought I could do it. But I can't. I can't kill another person.
  He's not a person, Professor. They're not people.
  I know. I know, and I keep telling myself that.
I'm so frightened.
Of what? Of them?
Of him?
Of myself.
It's understandable that you're confused.
The Devil was designed for temptation.
He can be charming and clever
and exciting.
And Mitchell can be those things too,
because he was made in the Devil's image, just as you were made in God's.
But you must remain strong.
I know.
But sometimes...
I want to surrender to it.
Then you must fight it!
Declare war on it.
If we're weak, then we allow the Devil to seduce us.
God is disappointed and we will be punished severely.
A day of wrath is that day.
A day of darkness and gloom.
"I will bring distress
"upon men...
"For they have sinned against the Lord,
"and their blood will be poured out like dust".
Help me.
I want
to fight it.
I shall help you.
I shall show you the way.
I shall tell you what you must do.
It's just that he, um...
  he left. So...
  Who is this?
  Simon.
  He's your son?
  (Give me a break.)
  No, Simon, my husband. My late husband.
  Yeah.
I just want to know that he's all right.
Yeah, yeah.
Er... Yep.
Yeah, he's...he's doing all right.
He's in a good place. He wants me to tell you he's content.
Is Tiny there too?
Is...?
Tiny.
His Yorkshire Terrier?
  Don't help him!
  Simon's surrounded by his friends and family and little...
little Timmy's lying on his feet.
  Tiny.
  Tiny, Timmy, whatever. Yep.
  Dog's up there. And he's very, very happy.
  She?
No, not Tiny. Tiny's not happy.
  I mean Simon's very happy.
  Why's Tiny not happy?
  He is.
  She!
Oh, er, wait. He's leaving us. He's fading, he's fading and he's gone.
Now, er... Am I sensing another spirit somewhere else?
There's been one sat here for 40 minutes, you giant twat.
I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Me?
  You can see me?
  I can see you.
  I could also hear you from backstage.
  How?
  You were shouting.
  No, I mean how can...
  And you're sitting in the wrong seats. Follow me, please.
  Wait. I don't understand.
  Sssh!
How can...?
You're a ghost!
Of course I'm a ghost. What did you think I was?
  An usher(!)
  Come on.
  A fella up there, with the... the white shirt.
  Christmas 1998.
Faulty panto pyrotechnic.
One minute I'm standing in the wings watching Widow Twankey belt out a chorus of "La Vida Loca",
the next? Bang!
Flat out on my back with every hair on my body standing to attention.
Gosh, that's awful.
  It was a terrible shock.
  Oh, I bet it was.
  No, I mean literally.
It was a terrible shock. That's what killed me.
The coroner said it was as if I'd been struck by lightning.
Here we are.
  The cheap seats.
  This thing's a heap of shit, Robin...
  Do they live here?
No. But when a psychic rolls into town, we get a good few ghosts back here.
You throw the term "psychic" around pretty loosely.
No, Alan was amazing, he really was.
Then one year he just started ignoring us. He stopped engaging.
I don't know why.
  What's happened to you, Alan?
  Jesus Christ!
Why aren't you listening to us, hmm?
Why aren't you passing on our messages?
  Why are you up there on a stage lying to people?
  Is someone here?
  Bingo.
  Who are you? What do you want?
  I want you to start listening to these poor souls, Alan, that's what I want.
  Alan!
Can you hear that? See, they need you, Alan.
I don't understand.
You can't hear them any more, can you?
Thank you. You too.
Oh, so anyway, it is the 27th.
  The 27th?
  There's no need to sound so freaked out, George.
It's a parent teachers evening. It's not a big deal.
  It would just mean a lot to me if you could be there.
  Ah. But is it definitely the 27th?
Mm hm. That's plenty of warning though, isn't it?
Sorry Sam, it's just I have this thing planned. It's a planned thing.
  What is?
  ..Erm, it's a work thing.
It's about every month or so.
In Liverpool.
Training.
Training? You're a hospital porter, George.
  Sport training.
  Sport?
You?
Yes, me. Sport what's so...?
I'm on a sports team.
It's toboggan.
  Did you just say toboggan?
  Yep.
Yes, I did.
Right, so you and Mitchell? You toboggan? In Liverpool?
Yeah. We are tobogganists.
Oh, can't you cancel it this once?
Can... Cancel? No o. Very big, big, huge championship coming up, so...
Oh, well... Well, it doesn't matter.
OK, come on.
Two years ago I was doing this show in Newcastle.
Mmm.
They let the kid doing work experience operate the smoke machine.
He didn't know when to stop.
It was like a scene from Backdraft.
I couldn't see where I was going
so I walked off the fucking stage.
  Oh, no.
  Right off it.
I woke up the next day in a hospital bed with eight stitches, short term memory loss and no sixth sense.
The knock must have switched something off
because from that day until this,
  I haven't heard a ghost.
  Oh, until I showed up.
Until you showed up.
That's why I've had to pretend.
Back then I would pray that they would stop.
Now that's finally happened,
and I'm praying they come back.
  I hope you don't mind me just...
  'Course not.
  I tried ringing your phone.
  I was in theatre so...
  Ah, of course.
  You've killed people.
  Not any more.
"Not any more"?
Do you know how insufficient that sounds? You have KILLED people!
You could be my salvation.
Don't think so.
Don't say that.
It's your world, Mitchell.
It's in every cell.
You can't just...change.
  I can.
  You're not strong enough. It finds you. It always finds you.
  Not this time.
Why? What's so different this time?
I have you.
It's a struggle, I can't lie.
It'll always gonna be a struggle.
But I can do this.
How?
  I'll leave them.
  They'll follow you.
  I'll tell them I'm finished with them, all of them.
  When?
What?
When will you tell them?
I'll call a meeting tomorrow night at the funeral parlour.
I'll see you later.
It's done.
Mitchell's gonna call a gathering.
  When?
  Tomorrow night at the funeral parlour.
Did he say how many of them?
Hi.
Hey.
What are you up to?
I'm just packing up some things.
Sam and I are gonna stay in the...
You can say it, George. I'm not gonna cry or anything.
We've found a new house and we're gonna stay there tonight.
SHE SOBS Oh, God.
  Annie, are you OK?
  Yes, George, I am fine.
I'm fine, it's just that...
What are you looking for?
  My bloody phone charger.
  Oh, that's in the oven.
Really? Oh, right. Cheers.
What?
When you said you were viewing houses, I started to hide your stuff.
  Why?
  I thought the more of your stuff I hid, then the longer it would take you to leave.
  Right, how much stuff are we talking about, roughly?
  George, I'm sorry about earlier. It's just...
I like it, just the three of us, it's us against the world.
I don't want to be against the world any more. It gets so tiring.
I want to be part of it.
We're all so scared of what might happen out there.
And huddle together here somehow makes us less afraid.
But do you know what? I am ready to be scared.
I can't let this thing own me any more.
You might have a point, George.
Red Robin, this is A1.
  Can you let me know when you have FOH clearance please? Over.
  Should be about 20 minutes.
Properly. Over.
This is Red Robin.
We will have Front of House clearance in 20 minutes approximately. Over.
  I don't think your heart's really in this, Red Robin. Over.
  Maybe because it's stupid. Over.
How's it stupid? Over.
Because I'm stood right next to you.
Besides they don't even work. They're not connected to anything.
Well, you're just determined to pick holes in this operation, aren't you?
Alan! Alan! Alan!
OK, all right, yes, calm down, settle down, thank you.
Can I have your attention please?
  Right, shut up or Alan's out of here!
  Jesus, pipe down!
Sorry.
Why are you even doing this?
Because I need to get out more.
It won't work.
Listen Alan, I'm helping you whether you like it or not, so just...
Deal with it.
OK. As some of you already know, Alan here, has been suffering from severe psychic blockage.
So we're going to have to do all that we can to get him through this very difficult time.
So let's pull together and let's make this work. OK?
You're with me, lovely, thank you.
So how are you gonna decide who goes first?
By using a very fair and democratic process.
I am Alan Cortez. Welcome to my Psychic Experience.
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe...
Now I'm,
  I'm sensing a spirit.
  If he squeals let him go.
  Who's calling me?
  Eenie, meenie, mi nie...
Who do we have?
  Moe.
  Yes!
Someone's coming through.
Do we have a name?
Jimmy.
I'm getting a Jimmy.
Who are you looking for, Jimmy?
My wife Orla.
He would like to speak to his wife Orla.
OK. Jimmy would like to speak to his wife, Orla.
  Do we have an Orla?
  That's me!
That that's me.
  That's my Jimmy.
  Welcome.
  You're sure?
  Oh, yeah.
Erm, Alan?
Jimmy has a pretty serious message for her. Er, apparently she's getting married again.
  Jimmy says you're getting married again, Orla.
  Yeah.
Well, well that's why I'm here, really. Cos I
I just wanted to check that...
he was all right with it.
  I'm not.
  Oh, he says he's not.
Yeah...
He wants you to know... that he's not.
He's what?
He's not OK with it.
  And why the fuck would that be?   Because apparently her new boyfriend's a massive tosser.
  And a sponger...
  And a sponger.
Because your new man is a massive tosser and a sponger.
  Allegedly.
  Why can't he just be happy for me?
  Shh!
  Well, you know he died in that car accident, not me. I'm still here!
You died in a car accident?
You tell that slapper I knew she was shagging him while I was still alive. Everyone knew.
Tell the truth, Orla. Or at least admit it!
I mean, what have you come down here for? Playing the fucking innocent!
  Shut up!
  You come down here for, playing the innocent?
I'm serious, no one gets to dodge out of it.
  This is very important to me, Ivan.
  Yeah.
I don't want to get into it right now. Look, I'll explain tonight, I'd just rather do it in person.
  Look, you just spread the word, OK? I want everyone there.
  Just, just leave it to me.
I've got most of them on my Twitter feed so it'll be all right, OK?
  OK, talk to you later.
  Got to go. Speak to you later.
  OK, bye.
  Yeah?
  Hi.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
  I'm from Avon and Somerset Energy.
  Uh huh?
We've had reports of a gas leak.
I'm afraid we're going to have to clear the premises.
I wouldn't bother.
They're all dead in there.
Get away from her!
I don't even know why it matters any more.
I don't know why it means so much.
But it's all that I think about.
It just keeps racing round and round in me head and for some reason...
  I'd really like it if she was to...
Do you know, Jimmy, leave it with me. Erm, Alan,
he just needs to hear her admit it.
Jimmy needs to hear you admit it, Orla.
He needs to hear you admit to the affair.
He was right. It's true.
And I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.
It's about time.
Oh, Jimmy.
Bye.
Please. Please just make sure he knows how sorry I am.
I do.
  Oh, he does.
  He does.
Jimmy?
Thank you.
Alan, he's gone.
And now he's finally managed to move on.
  Thank you.
  Thank you. Well done.
Well done.
I'm sensing another presence.
So.
Your table is almost completed.
Yeah, if you say so.
Attach B9 to A5.
B9 to a bloody bollocking bollocks piece of Scandinavian shit.
Bollocks, absolute shit tat, bloody bollocking...
Hello, George.
Hey there.
Um...I'm just...
Your mum asked me to... Where, where is your mum?
She's upstairs unpacking, George. Do you know what I did today, George?
Why do you keep saying my name?
When I went back to school, I looked up some stuff on the computer. Tobogganing is such a cool sport.
Yeah... Well... I love it.
Do you use a Katana sleigh or a Tanto?
Er...well...
  I've used both.
  Really?
Mmm, but I much prefer the, er, the Tanto, because, er, well,
because, Molly, it's faster.
It's a type of Samurai sword, George.
Samu... What?
A Tanto is a type of Samurai sword. So is a Katana.
  Oh, you tricked me.
  I knew you were lying. Mum might have believed you, but...
And I love Mum...
But if she was in my class, I have a feeling she'd be on the yellow table.
And the yellow table is?
It's not good, George.
It's not good at all.
Who's next?
  Right, eenie, meenie, minie, moe. Catch a tiger by his toe...
  Annie!
  I can't believe you're going on tour with Alan!
  Yeah, I know.
It's a bit scary, really. Good scary.
But you know I can't stay stuck here forever, can I?
No, I know. I've been here for over a decade.
  Well, look, why don't you come with us, Robin?
  No. There's not much point.
He can't hear me. I'm not like you.
I haven't got your confidence.
Bloody aerial.
It did this earlier as well.
  'Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I am Alan Cortez...
  Whose turn is it, Annie?
  'and this is my Psychic Experience.'
  Annie?
Annie? Who's next?
Already I'm sensing a presence.
Who are you?
Do I have a name?
Annie?
Annie!
Yeah.
Who am I looking for first?
Carmen.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have someone who wants to make contact with Carmen.
Do we have a Carmen in the house?
Anyone?
There's the lady down there, could she have a microphone please?
Is there someone in particular you're hoping to get a message from, Carmen?
Erm...
Well, I suppose I...
  God, this is insane.
  Take your time. It's all right.
Yes.
My daughter.
Don't tell me.
Your daughter's name is...
It's me.
She's here for me.
That's my mum.
Your daughter's name was...Annie.
Is there something you'd like to ask Annie?
I just...
Well, I don't even know what I want to hear. I don't know what would help.
I mean losing a child is a...
It's a unique kind of pain. It's...
The pain is...
spectacular.
But you know what? If you told me that you could take that pain away...
I'm not sure that I'd want you to, because...
it's...it's all I've got left.
I want to feel that pain
and I deserve to feel that pain.
Because I should have known.
She was my little girl.
And I should've known that she was in danger.
I should've known that she was scared.
Because I'm her mum, and I really should've known.
I don't know what to say.
Don't hurt her. Or if you have to hurt her,
do it once, do it now.
Leave.
  Molly!
  My Dad hurt her.
He told lies, too.
I would never hurt your mum, Molly. It's just that...
I have this secret, which means sometimes I need to distance myself.
And I'm worried that if she finds out, she won't want me anymore.
  She'll think that I'm...
  What?
A freak.
A boy in my class has six toes on one foot.
Is it something like that?
  Yeah. I suppose it is a bit.
  You can tell her.
  I can't. I'm too scared to take the risk.
  She loves you, George.
No matter what.
Well, I'm gonna go watch my Hannah Montana DVD, so...
Molly?
Thanks.
Right.
P5 to A9. Come on you fucker!
I'm sure you know why I've gathered you all here today.
Well, you don't know why because I've just...
I had a little chat with, er... Oh!
I've something that I want to say to all of you.
Everybody, everybody here that...
Oh...balls!
Erm... This isn't easy. This isn't easy for...for...for me.
I'm out. I'm out.
I'm glad you came. She's here, Carmen.
Seeing you seemed to silence her.
But she's here.
No, I shouldn't have come. I'm sorry, I've made a mistake.
  I'm not lying.
  I hope you are lying.
I hope you are, Alan. Because otherwise what you're telling me is my daughter,
my dead daughter, is in this room and she can't speak to me.
She can speak to you, she can speak to total strangers, but not to me, her mum.
Look, Carmen...
When I was...when I was seven,
they showed us how to make these on Blue Peter.
Anything I made before that always ended in a disaster. But these I...
  I mastered.
  Annie used to make hundreds of those things.
I'm sure that it drove her mad.
But she never stopped me.
I always used to love them.
Annie!
Oh, my God. There's so much I need to say to you.
I've spent every day missing you.
I've spent everyday thinking about you, speaking about you.
I know people think I'm mad. I mean, your dad he thinks I'm mad.
He wouldn't say it, obviously, but I can see it in his eyes.
And he keeps saying things like "You should go out more, maybe you should work."
You know, he wants me to do normal things.
Like anything could ever be normal again, I mean...
But, Mum, you can't live your life like that. You're holding on.
She thinks you need to let go.
She's my daughter for God's sake. How can I let go?
Yes, I am your daughter and I love you, very, very much.
But that is why I want you to live your life.
Stop torturing yourself.
It's important to her, Carmen.
Please, Mum, there is something I really think you should do.
I've been so afraid of this place.
I just thought if I came here this would become
my last memory of you.
And somehow,
your face and your eyes and your laugh
would be replaced by this.
But I still have you.
I do still have you, don't I?
You will always have me, Mum.
So I'm going to try. I'm really going to try.
Bye, Mum.
The time is almost upon us.
It is.
We should prepare ourselves.
Lord, we thank you
  for this opportunity of doing thy work.
  'How you supposed to bloomin' unlock this door then?'
'Chris and new landlord Jeff have agreed that a temporary arrangement...'
Mum? >
Oi! What's wrong?
Sssh!
Mum! >
Coming, sweetheart.
Mum! Mum, please! >
It's OK, it's OK. I'm here.
It's OK. Hey, hey, hey. There you go.
  Everything OK?
  I had a bad dream.
  Oh!
  About you.
A bad dream about George?
Well, he was George,
but it wasn't George.
Oh! Well, we'll read you a lovely story and you can go back to sleep.
And I was calling his name but he just stared back.
His eyes were dark. They looked right through me... They looked inside me.
Here we go.
I can't come on the road with you, Alan.
I know.
Speaking to my mum and telling her that she
had to move on, well, it just made me realise what a hypocrite I was being.
If I come away with you
then I'd just be running away.
  It won't be the same without you.
What will you do?
Without an interpreter, I mean.
Do you think Robin would be any good?
How do you know about Robin?
I heard her.
They're coming back, Annie.
They're taking their time, but they're coming back.
  Hi.
  Hiya.
  Hello.
Well, I think Robin will be an excellent choice.
She did learn from the master, after all.
But what are you going to do?
I think it's time to go.
So you take it easy. Be nice to the ghosts.
Talking to someone you've lost...
You don't know what a big deal that is.
Bye, Alan.
Hello.
Hi.
  Are we late?
  No. Come in, come in, come in.
There you are. It's cold isn't it?
Take a drink.
Only alcohol tonight I'm afraid, none of the hard stuff.
Lord I acknowledge thee.
All creation was made for thee.
Exorcise thy thoughts...
Mitchell! Hey.
How are you doing man?
Ivan... Ivan... Can I have a word?
Yes?
He's just gone inside, sir.
  Professor. It's time.
  He's early.
  Does it matter?
  Others may still arrive.
Look, this was your plan.
And do you know? It's working.
  Everyone's on the wagon.
  Yeah.
Well, aside from me obviously, but I'm, you know, special needs.
Why do you want to throw it away?
I don't want to throw it away, I want to pass it over.
I want someone else to take the reins.
Someone, you know, intelligent and capable and disinterested.
  Oh, my good God. No!
  Just hear me out!
I'm just not ready for that kind of responsibility yet.
You're 237 years old! When do you think you'll be ready?
Look, it's a caretaker role, that's all. Everything's set up.
  All you've got to do is keep the plates spinning.
  We are supposed to set up a relationship
with the next Chief Constable, since you tore the last one's throat out.
Maybe there's no need. Everyone's clean now. You said yourself.
  Until someone goes bananas and attacks a bunch of Cub Scouts!
  So set up a new partnership!
I mean, Christ, you've arm wrestled Colonel Gaddafi, you can handle
  the Chief Constable for Bristol and District.
  Mitchell!
At the moment I'm keeping my excesses in check
as a favour to you, and because it amuses me.
But, erm...
you have no idea of the effort that entails.
Now I can't lead, not even by example.
I'm just one step away from wiping out an entire branch of Argos.
Then this will be ideal, it'd give you something to focus on. This is the problem with vampires.
Too much fuckin' introspection!
  Jesus!
  Mitchell.
You're gonna have to find someone else, mate.
Ivan, I've met someone.
I can't be with her and be part of this.
I know it's a big ask,
I know it's a huge favour, but I can't...
She's my way out of this chaos. This could be my last chance.
And if I get...
Oh, forget it! It doesn't matter.
You should have said it was about love.
I get it now.
We all lead long and appalling lives.
But I have my Daisy.
Everyone deserves a Daisy.
So...
..after you.
Hey guys, thanks for coming.
Let's, er...gather round.
I just think we need to wait a few more minutes.
I've waited long enough. This is the will of the Lord.
I am prepared to carry it out.
Are you?
Professor, you need to say the words.
Do it.
I'm sorry for keeping you in suspense like this.
I'm sure you're all wondering why I brought you here tonight.
Erm...
I've made a decision.
'It's time.'
This has been a really...
a really interesting journey but tonight marks...
The end of the journey for me.
  I'll be leaving you in capable hands of...
And the deed is done.
Shall we pray?
I renounce Satan and all his evil works and all his empty promises.
  Amen.
  Amen.
You don't have a cure.
There isn't a cure.
  Are you OK?
  What did you say?
What's wrong with you? HE ROARS
You just want to be set free, don't you?
