Tonight, one of the statesman of British broadcasting. He has read
the news, presented This Is Your Life, and hosted the Antiques
Roadshow. It is, of course, Michael Aspel.
Tonight, though, we are very interested in why you have started
wearing these. I have just started. Usually in the privacy of my
chambers, but there is a reason. Your Cards tight wearing them?
my calves are very loose, I'm afraid. We will get to the reason
of why you are wearing them shortly. Gyles Brandreth joins us tonight
Live from the first night of the Edinburgh Fringe with his top three
picks. Hello. Yes, will come to Edinburgh's
Fringe. I am at the biggest arts festival on earth. 40,000
performances, 3000 different shows. Some household names   Simon Callow,
Dizzee Rascal, Jimmy Carr   and some real wannabes who lie here
probably to lose money. We have got madness and mayhem and my pick of
the three Fringe acts, starting They are all at it. Have you been
up to the festival in your time? I'm ashamed to say, I never have. I
have done a lot of broadcasts from there but never the festival, so
that is on the list. We will get you your shoes back in a minute!
Earlier today, David Cameron met President Zebari of Pakistan at
Chequers. President Zardari has been criticised for not returning
home to deal with the worst floods their living memory, which have
affected over 12 million people. Many throughout the UK have been
moved to offer help, but for the 1 million British Pakistanis, the
disaster unfolding thousands of Every day this week, someone I know
has been in touch about the crisis in Pakistan. Campaigns on text
message, Facebook and through Pakistani businesses have rallied
the community to help. Links between British Pakistanis and
their homeland remains strong. It is estimated that each year half a
billion pounds is sent from families in Britain to their
families back in Pakistan. Most Muslims in Britain are Pakistani,
and most of those Pakistanis are from Kashmir or the Punjab, two of
the areas most affected by the floods. So when a disaster like
this strikes, the call to action gets a big response. This man's
family have a home in one of the worst hit towns. He has been sent
photos of the flood damage by his uncle. My immediate cousins, one of
my sisters and my uncles, they were all there when the flood happened.
Due to the water, the whole communication infrastructure was
destroyed so we could not get hold of anyone. We did not know how they
were, because there were infants there. We know they were short of
food. The water level was up to the second floor. They had no where to
go. How have they been affected? They are still in the camps. After
five days, the mobile phones are working so they are letting us know
they are well. But there is a risk of cholera and diarrhoea. It takes
years to build your home, community and surroundings and suddenly in
moments everything is worthless. They have lost everything but at
least they are alive. At mosques like this in full third, charities
working on the ground in Pakistan are using prayer time to drum up
support.    in Ilford. How has today's collection gone? It has
gone really well, better than we thought it would. Usually Thursday
is not busy but we have got quite a few big notes. Most people who come
are Pakistani, even if their family is not affected, it is the whole
community spirit. I want to see if someone will make a pledge for
£3,000. Pakistani businesses are also joining in the community
spirit and playing a major part in the relief effort, like this
restaurant in Southall that his host to a charity dinner tonight.
Since the 1960s we have always been engaging with the community and
getting involved in fund raising. Whatever the event. £15,000. If you
are in a position that you are able to help, I believe you should help
and you should go above and beyond the call of duty to actually help
our fellow brothers. It is pretty impressive. They have already
raised £26,250, Amir Khan's boxing gloves are still going into the
auction. Looking for £400. With more rain forecast, the catastrophe
seems far from over, but one thing is for sure, the continuing efforts
of the community in Britain will make a big contribution to
relieving the flood victims suffering.
The monsoon rains are obviously not unusual in Pakistan but these are
the worst in 80 years. Joining us is Philip Avery from the BBC
weather Centre. You are going to try and put into perspective where
the rains have come from. A want to show you the standard set up where
this moisture comes from in an average year. A lot of warm and
moist air comes in across the Arabian Sea, across the Bay of
Bengal. That is where we get the standard year from. The real drive,
what makes this year so exceptional, is the position of something way up
in the atmosphere. This is the jet stream, which people will be
familiar with. We talked about it in the context of the wet summer
here in 2007. This is an incursion of really Paula air in the upper
atmosphere which causes condensation between the warm air
at lower levels on the cold stuff higher up. It squeezes the moisture
out of the air. It is like a perfect storm when it comes
together. It is almost incredible to believe. We do not see anything
like it in the Western world. the worst over Pakistan? I'm afraid
not. June and July tends to be the peak and there is a slow Taylor
through August. That is not to say that we might not seek further
episodes of pretty heavy rain, one as early as the forthcoming weeks.

We have a quick experiment for you to play along with at home. Michael
Aspel is our guess this evening it has been on the sofa for eight
minutes. But what colour shirt is he wearing? He has a jacket on, but
underneath, can you remember if? Can you remember? I caught it out
of the corner of my eye. It is a black shirt. I could not remember.
It was a white when I left home. Don't worry if you did not get it
right because the brain can be selective about what it remembers.
Rav Wilding explains how this can complicate things for the police,
who sometimes have to rely on what our eyes witness.
If you witness a crime, catching the person responsible could depend
on the information you give to police. But according to research,
eyewitness accounts are only around 65% accurate. Cases can stand and
fall on evidence from them. So scientists have been finding out
why we're getting it wrong. They have discovered we are pretty bad
at recalling the details of how people look, even people we know
well. Tell me what Elaine is wearing. A white blouse. No, that
was wrong. I think his shoes were Brown. What colour are her eyes?
Green, blue. If we cannot remember details about those closest to us,
what chance do we have of remembering someone we have just
seen for a matter of seconds, particularly if they have just
committed a crime? Dr Rob Jenkins is a psychologist at Glasgow
University. The memory is surprisingly sparse. Things that
you have no cause to pay attention to   what shoes your friend is
wearing   they tend not to get picked up so well. What about
facial features? Facial features are actually very difficult to
describe. He is going to demonstrate this in an experiment.
He has asked four volunteers to wait for him in a lecture room. But
what they do not know is that the experiment has already started.
am sorry, I think I left my key in here on the table. This is David.
He is a member of Rob's psychology team. Did you see a key on the
table? Now, Robb will ask each volunteer to describe David's face.
It was not pale, not suntan. Still a bit youthful. A bit of a red skin
tone. Can you tell me about his eyes? I can't remember. Someone
said he had not quite pale skin. Someone said it was a normal
complexion. Someone else said a bit red. What is normal to you might be
read to me. Even if you have a vivid picture in mind, it is not
clear exactly what words you should use to describe it. But supposing
you do manage to describe a suspect, the information you give could be
used to put together a line up, the ultimate test of your memory and
facial recognition skills. Rob gathers eight volunteers to watch a
video of a stage crime where a wallet is snatched from an
unguarded bag. Now they must identify the perpetrator. The actor
who plays the criminal is not in the line up, but will anyone spot
that? Six people picked out an innocent man. Only two volunteers
noticed our thief was not there. Memories can mislead us, because as
soon as they are laid down they start to decay. Sometimes we will
pick out someone who fits that stereotype of looking slightly
shifty or untrustworthy. knowledge psychologists are gaining
about our memory is helping improve police procedures. They know how to
sift through the information witnesses provide an extract what
is important. Modern policing has changed beyond recognition, with
forensics, DNA testing and new technology. And even though it can
be unreliable, eyewitness testimony is still crucial and can make all
the difference in the fight against crime.
Here is a quiz. What colour shirt was Philip Avery wearing? He was
wearing a denim shirt, pale blue. Blue and white. You can have it.

this. 10 o'clock, so over to the news studio and Kenneth Kendall.

Michael, you are about to embark on your 4th appearance as the narrator.
What is it that keeps you going back? Being a masochist helps.
Watching that, I thought I was going to look good, but I looked
more Square than I could ever imagine. It is a challenge, that is
all it is. It is not like doing a play. As the narrator, you do not
interact with the cast. All that you get is things shouted at you by
the audience. There is loads of heckling. How hard is it to stick
to the script? Vary. The worst thing is getting back to it
afterwards. I tried to learn the script. They had given me a book
and I did not want to have the book because people would shout out,
This Is Your Life. When did you first do it? That was in Brighton,
four years ago. We are going back there, so I will see some old
costumes. My friends were in the audience the first night and the
manager of the theatre pushed past them to sit down in his immaculate
dinner suit and a pair of knickers. He always dressed like that!

Good lad! The Rocky Horror Show will be in Woking and Brighton
throughout September. Gyles Brandreth has his own cast of
colourful characters tonight, he is live up a first night of the
Edinburgh Fringe where he is giving us his top three picks. What is
number two? Number two, I have gone for a couple of magic moments.

Very good. When most of us see one of these, we know to proceed with
caution because there is a learner driver ahead. Or to proceed with
extreme caution because there is a hen party ahead. . And Lucy
Siegle visited one estate whose residents would be quite happy
Eddie is so furious he has been compelled to spend days recording
passing vehicles using his trusty cine film camera. His story begins
22 years ago when he purchased his Ideal Home on his perfect housing
estate in South Woodford, East London. As soon as I bought this
house, I did not look at the condition, I knew what I could do
to it, and I went straight in and I'd done what I wanted to achieve.
It is your dream? My dream. But for the past decade, a welcome
visitors onto this estate have taken the edge of his domestic
bliss. Learners, learners, learners, from morning until night. All day
long. There is another one. People would say they have to learn some
wire. Why not here? This is an enclosed estate, if they want to
learn there are other areas. What you have moved here if you had
known that this was going to be an issue? No way. Really? I would
never have moved here, and other residents would say the same.
reckons his estate is the busiest spot in Britain for learner drivers.
Two! And another one. I thought the residents might have been
exaggerating a little bit when I arrived this morning but I have
just counted 13 cars in five minutes. That is a lot. According
to the Driving Standards Agency the average learner has around 45 hours
of professional training before passing their test. It has been a
while since I had my last Lassen and I forgot how terrifying the
experience can be. If there are any problems, I have my brakes. Sandra
regularly brings clients to this estate, and for instructors like
her the reason for its popularity is simple. People travel from quite
far to come to the Test centre, the Test centre is two minutes away. It
is practical and people love the environment. I have had some abuse
when I have been parked up with a student in a car. It intimidates
them, they are stressed out enough. We all have a British legal right
to live and enjoy our lives like everybody else. We are not hurting
anybody. I don't think I will tell Eddie I have been joining the
nearly 7 million holders a provisional licences in Britain.
Where he uses his trusty camera to gather evidence, the issue is
dividing neighbours on both sides of the garden fence. You can hardly
come out of the house and not see within five minutes about four or
five in a row. It is a lovely neighbourhood to Laverne and I
think learner drivers are a minor nuisance as far as I'm concerned.
Legally, I don't think you can do anything whatsoever. The Sharma
family see both sides of the argument. Their son learn to drive
on the estate, while his sister plans to do the same next year. But
mum is dead set against the estate's constant use by learners,
and for good reason. I am looking at this wall, what happened?
Basically, a learner driver came straight through and the hall wall
came down, electronic sensor, everything came apart and had to be
repaired. It used to be a solid wall, it will never be the same
again. It cost in the region of about £2,500 to repair. Around one
in five newly qualified drivers will have an accident in the first
year of getting behind the wheel. And campaigner Eddie believes he
has evidence showing the damage some cause before passing their
test. I get letters from residents
dropping through my door, a learner has hit my car and knocked my wall
down. You can't ignore it. local council recognises there is a
problem but it is adamant that restricted access to the estate is
not the answer. Maybe it is time for residents and driving
instructor to go face to face and see if they can thrash things out.
There is never a time when there is not one on the road. Wherever we go,
we get pushed away. How are we going to live? You wouldn't really
know that. When I go to the Test centre there will be a notice,
instructors, please keep off. Where are we going to go? Is the bottom
line you want learner drivers off the street? Yes, please. Forever.
As long as possible. Little compromise. Eddie is looking to
take his campaign to the courts to prevent driving instructors and
pupils from using his estate for good. I will not give up, no way.
The only time I will give up is when I go underground and I will
know nothing about it. A little bird tells us your family don't
think you are very good driver? They think I'm a very good driver,
I'm just lousy at parking. My son has written a song called my dad
can't part, which is cruel but true. It is like in an aeroplane, take 
off and landing are the most dangerous. But you passed first
time? Yes. And you know what they say? They are not as good as people
who pass second time. I passed first time. I was second. What a
surprise! Is it the reverse parking?
We will go back to Gyles and Edinburgh in a moment for his
number one pick of the Fringe, but throughout the week he has been
looking at the naughty side of British comedy. We know you are a
big fan of one of our more saucy comedians, Max Miller. Absolutely,
from childhood, one of the greatest comics ever born. I met him once in
a hotel lounge in Cardiff in about 1955. You know what he's said to
me? He said, hello. . was it. And you still love him?
was thrilled. Here is a photograph of you unveiling a plaque of his.
Oh, yes. There are plaques of him all over Brighton, he lived there
and he was always on the run, as it were, people kept catching up with
him. You are going to a garden party this week? A Max Miller
Appreciation Society deal in Brighton. You are not the only fan
of the cheeky chappie. Have you heard the one about the 18
year old girl was swallowed they pay? It is a family shows I can't
give you the punchline, but it was just one of the many cheeky jokes
that made comedian Max Miller a household name. He was born Thomas
Henry Sargent in 1894. Throughout the 1920s and 30s he appeared in
music hall up and down the country, rising to become a huge staff. But
he issued the bright lights of fame and fortune and lived his entire
life at the seaside in his home town of Brighton.
Fittingly, there is even a Max Miller Museum here. It is a shrine
to the cheeky chappie at the back of the cheerful chippy, a place of
pilgrimage for his many admirers. John is chairman of the Max Miller
Appreciation Society. Why should there be a shrine to a dead
comedian? He had a style and a manner about him and he was cheeky.
Today it is all in your face, then it was innuendo. Them there was the
wedding breakfast, I was invited to that. On the cake had said everyone
can take a piece home. Well, you know me, I took two pieces   a
blonde and a brunette! He was one of the lads. And his marvellous
suits and correspondent shoes and his hat, a wonderful trilby hat.
The moment he'd stepped on the stage, people would recognise him.
He was slightly naughty, you thought he would say something but
he never got round to it. I like the girls he do, I like the girls
who don't, I hate the girl who says she will, and then she won't. But
the girl I liked best of all is the girl who says she never does...
That became his signature, the saucy joke, as it were, with the
guilty thought in your head? Absolutely, and you never quite
knew when that moment was coming, so there was anticipation, and his
signature tune. And he didn't immediately appear on the stage,
but then the curtains would go back and he would appear. People
immediately started laughing. walked on a funny. One might be his
old mates started screaming and bawling. She said there two men in
my room. I said, what you want me to do? She said, sling one of them
out. He was controversial, he was allegedly banned from the BBC for
telling an off colour joke? president of the society and myself
have been trying for a just to get to the bottom of this. There is
allegedly a joke about a young lady going up a mountain pass, or a
fellow going up the mountain pass. We don't believe he told it and I
challenge the BBC, when did he tell it, how long was he banned? Nobody
tells us. You should have come to The One Show, because we have done
their homework, we have searched the archives and discover the truth.
An exclusive for you are. We can reveal to you that Max Miller was
little bit of sauce, not the tomato sauce, but a little bit of British
chic. Whatever happened to British cheat? What made him one and only?
He was charismatic, he was cheeky, he said it but we shared his view.
There will never be another. said there will be the three acres
and a cow if you marry my daughter. I am still waiting for the three
acres! Max died in Brighton in 1963, but
the cheeky chappie lives on in his saucy and suggestive jokes. As he
liked to say, all clever stuff, no rubbish. Let's give the last word
to the pure gold of the music hall. I'm going to catch my train.
Until we meet again. A happy go lucky, happy a lucky
From one of Britain's best known performers to the aspiring acts
dying to get noticed. Gyles is at the Edinburgh Fringe with his
number one. I can hear you, certainly I came
here. What I love about the Fringe is the sheer diversity, from
traditional music like Barber Shopera to this extraordinary
puppet show, the Scottish boss at a sock puppet theatre. Hello!    read
Scottish Falsetto Puppet Theatre. From the Ukraine, the extraordinary
alley and a Yulia with their amazing show known as The Crack,
they are my number one. But we also have stalwart, people like me and
Nicholas Parsons. How long are we on for? Just a minute. No, until
the 30th August! And I have Nicholas Parsons happy hour.
