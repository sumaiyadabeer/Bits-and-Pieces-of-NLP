The very grand Corn Exchange, King's Lynn, is the setting for today's Flog It!
The grade II listed facade of King's Lynn Corn Exchange is a testimony to the splendour of the Victorian age
and King's Lynn's years of prosperity.
In 1877, the Corn Exchange played host to Queen Victoria's Jubilee celebrations.
Then, after a stint as an ice rink and a dance hall, it became what we see today.
And with the help of our two experts, Elizabeth Talbot and Charlie Ross,
I'm sure we're going to put on a show worthy of this splendid venue.
Well, it's now 9.30, so let's get this massive queue inside and get the show on the road.
  Are you ready, everybody?
  Yes!
Door's open.
I'm reading what you've brought here, Tina.
This little scrap of paper's very interesting.
It's illustrating a few pieces of the Lowestoft china collection
that was in an auction at the early part of the 20th century.
  So this comes along with your little sauce boat?
  Yes, yes.
  she was a Lowestoft girl.
  Right.
Her mother and my grandfather used to go and buy the odd bit, maybe at sales.
I've only got this one piece
and I thought, right, I think it needs to go to someone who's really got a collection.
The piece of paper has always been with it.
So this will have been your grandparents', who bought this at this auction?
It's lovely to put it into context and have a bit of provenance about it.
Lowestoft was an east coast porcelain factory, operating between 1757 and 1799.
  Ah, right. Not very long.
  Not very long at all.
They specialised in what's called soft paste porcelain, a very porous porcelain.
Stylistically, the shapes, the moulding and the patterns
that they transfer printed or hand painted on top,
were often influenced by the Worcester factory
that were producing contemporary pieces at the time.
So at first glance, some people might say that this is a piece of Worcester.
One of the biggest giveaways is the foot rim, which is so thick and chunky...
  Yes.
  ..a bit naive, really.
The moulding on the body is ribbed,
which has then got little cartouches outlined with ferns and flowers,
is then centred by transfer printed blue.
And it has blue on the shoulders, which is quite sweet.
And on the inside, you've got some more transfer printed flowers.
So all in all, it's an actually quite intricate piece, but it's still kind of provincial, really.
Provincial, yeah. Rustic.
Absolutely, but that adds to its charm
  and given its many, many years in age, it's in lovely order.
  Oh, good.
  That's good.
  I notice there's a very tiny chip,
barely visible, but it's there.
And there's a slight grease spot on the inside, but apart from that...
really lovely, lovely piece.
The fact that you are potentially looking at selling it not too far from Lowestoft,
you're really tapping into the local market of collectors.
  But it's the sort of thing which will gather enthusiasts from all over.
  That's good.
I think you should be advertising it or putting it into sale with an estimate of £200 £300.
  Really?
  Would you be happy with that?
Yes! I want to get a new carpet.
  There we go, we'll contribute to that if nothing else.
  Yes, that would be wonderful.
I think if we put a £200 reserve on, with discretion.
And just looking at this piece of paper and I think it's this one here.
So it's going to find its way into another collection.
Another catalogue, that would be great.
  Very poignant, Wendy.
  Yes.
Tell me about this picture.
I bought it about six months ago
in a charity shop in Cambridge for £14.99.
  Yes.
What made you buy it?
Well, I thought it was very well done.
I thought it was an original
and I thought it was possibly worth more than £14.99, to be honest.
I also thought it would be interesting to try and find out a bit more about it.
Find out who the artist was and if possible, to find out who Colonel Bradley was.
I think we can probably help with the artist...
whoever Lieutenant Colonel Bradley was, I don't know.
I suspect that if he died in the war and I can see from here
he got as far as 1917, and a lot of them got to 1917 and got no further.
I love it. They are both original sketches.
One is coloured and gouache
and the other, just really a sketch, charcoal and colouring.
Obviously the artist was French, not only by the name of him there, but also the writing on the top here.
"Amicalement au Lieutenant Colonel Bradley."
"Ami" is friend in French.
"Amicalement" isn't a word I know...
I would think colleague of Lieutenant Colonel Bradley and it's signed by him.
And then at the bottom here, "To Lieutenant Colonel Bradley".
So this is, I imagine, a portrait of Lieutenant Colonel Bradley,
done presumably at the front by Jean Berne Bellecour.
"En respectueuse sympathie,"
"with sympathetic respects," literally translated and dated 1917.
  But I think you've got a cracking investment here for your £14.99.
  Good.
I rather think this is a bit special and I think your £14.99
  has turned into a couple of hundred pounds' worth.
  That's good, yes.
I'd like to see a saleroom estimate of £100 £200.
  It's a wide range, reserve it at £100.
  Right.
And if we managed to turn it into a hundred or two, have you any designs to go back into charity shopping?
I probably would give some of the money to the charity shop
and then possibly look at putting it towards another picture.
  Thank you very much.
  Thank you.
  Pleasure.
This figure of Garibaldi, John, is this yours, or...?
No, it's my mother's, I've brought it along for her.
It was passed on from her great aunt.
  To her? OK, so she's had it for a little while now?
  A few years, yeah.
So does your mother collect Staffordshire figures?
  No, she doesn't. Just one off... it's been passed down.
and do you like it?
And Karen, do you like it at all?
  Um, No.
  It's a bit gaudy looking.
  Bit gaudy?
  I don't think your mum's got it out, has she?
  No.
  It's been wrapped away in a box.
  Yeah.
  Gaudy Garibaldi, eh?
  Yeah, that's it.
  Now, in the Staffordshire potteries throughout the Victorian period,
starting sort of 1840s throughout to certainly 1900,
there were many factories producing quite cheap figures.
They were simple to make, not very aesthetically pleasing.
They were quite lumpy and not very well detailed.
They were hand painted and then they were often sold in little shops.
Or they were indeed prizes at fairs and things.
The ones which most people associate with them are either Staffordshire spaniels, King Charles spaniels,
or figures such as this. This one is a figure of Garibaldi
and he was a 19th century general
who unified Italy. And this one is all hand painted.
It would have been fairly quickly painted, so you can actually see the brush strokes on here.
He's not one of the rarest, but he stands well, he's a nice bright, colourful example.
Your mother's thinking of selling it, does she or you know what it might be worth?
  Not at all, really, no.
  Would you pay anything for it?
Personally, no.
  You really don't like it, then?
  It's a bit of an eye sore, really.
I think that in this condition, which is structurally sound,
but there is a little bit of wear to him, that he would probably fetch between £70 £100.
  At round about that sort of mark, do you think your mother would be happy to sell it?
  I think she would, yeah.
Should we, to be on the safe side, put a reserve on for her so she doesn't feel as though we...
  Yeah, yeah, that would be fine.
  You're being advised on the left there, a good idea.
  I think it would be fair and I think if we put a £70 reserve on it,
  we'll see how we get on. OK, thank you.
  Thank you very much.
You have to get really close in on these two drunken bricklayer vases,
because at first glance, they look identical but this one
has a slight blue hue to it. Now that is indigo and this one,
well that's definitely pewter, but they do look alike.
  Ev, that's a strange name as well, what's that short for?
  It's short for Everard.
Everard, right, OK, how did you come by these?
Well, I bought a house and these were part of the furniture that were left in the house.
I paid £600 for everything that was left in the house, including the car in the garage.
Gosh! People were desperate to move then, that's all I can say.
You got a really good deal. And you know what they are, they're Whitefriars.
They're the drunken bricklayer vase, designed by Geoffrey Baxter in 1967.
He was their most prolific recent designer.
He came up with the textured bark vase, because he had a little kiln at home, a little furnace,
and he thought, "I'll collect twigs and leaves from the garden,
"wrap it around this mould and see what happens."
Hey presto, they liked it and they gave him a job as a designer.
I believe these are hobnail marks... hobnails that they put into the mould.
Yep. They used to throw all sorts of rubbish into the mould.
It's quite clever really. It's so iconic, this particular shape.
The collectors absolutely love them and I've got to admit,
the blue tablecloth doesn't do them justice, does it?
You need to hold them right up in the light and let the light bounce
right through these to actually appreciate the colour in the glass.
And I think Geoffrey Baxter had that in mind when he designed them.
They should be on a glass shelf or on a windowsill with a lot of light flooding through them.
Any idea what they're worth? These were made in two sizes.
The smaller one's 180mm and the larger one's, I think, at 340.
I'm hoping they'll make at least £200 each.
Oh, they'll easily make that. I think the £600 you gave for the contents, well,
you've got £600 here quite easily.
Shall we put them into auction with a value of £600 £900?
  I'm happy with that.
  Happy with that? Let's flog it then.
So, time for our first visit to the auction room.
Tina's Lowestoft sauce boat looks good for its age and should make a decent showing.
Charlie was very taken by this interesting drawing
dating from World War One and bought for a snip in a charity shop.
No one liked this gaudy Garibaldi very much, but let's hope there's a buyer out there who does.
Whitefriars always does well and these drunken bricklayer vases should be no exception.
We're at Bateman's in Stamford for today's auction,
where valuer Kate Bateman has seen something she likes.
Tina is selling the family heirlooms here.
This has been in her family three generations.
It is something for the purist,
I love it, 18th century Lowestoft.
Little sauce boat, we've got a valuation of £200 £300.
That sounds cheap to me. It's really nice,
the condition's great, there's a few little nibbles but apart from that...
That's to be expected, isn't it?
If you're from 1780, I hope I look that good when I'm that old.
But it's a nice piece... hand decorated, it's a proper antique, this one.
  OK, what's the proper price, then, if it's a little cheap?
  I would've hoped for the £500 mark.
I'm rather hoping for that, now you've said it. And I'm sure Tina is!
I could be wrong, you never know what's going to happen.
I've just been joined by Wendy in a packed sales room, it's getting tense, isn't it? This is your lot.
  Right.
  That little watercolour by Bellecour, it is fantastic.
And I think this is one of my favourite lots in the sale.
I'd like it on my wall and I can remember Charlie picking it up
and looking at me and I went, "Ooh that's good! Ooh, I want that one.
"I think that's worth 500 quid."
I do think it's undervalued by you, but you're the expert and you're being cautious.
I've done a bit of research since and I think the price is about right, to be honest.
I love the image of him walking away. That's quite poignant.
Wendy, this is it, let's do our own battle, it's going under the hammer now.
195, two drawings of military interest, two drawings of soldiers...
pencil and watercolour. I don't know, start me off...
£50 for it? £50 I'm bid. At £50 only, nice sell then.
You'd never sell at £50.
£55, £60, £65, £70, £75, £80, £85, £90, £95, this side at £95.
Gone then at £95.
£100, £110, at £110, £120,
  Come on, it's worth a lot more.
£200, £210, £220, £230, at £230 right over here.
£240, £250, £260, at £260 now, I can't see this side.
At £260. Is that it? Finished then at £260.
Who have I missed?
At 260...
Yes, £260, that's good, very good, we're pleased with that.
  I'm pleased with that.
  So, what are going to do with £260?
  Well, I don't think it'll change my life.
  It's not going to, is it?
  There's a bit of commission to pay as well.
  Probably a nice lunch, something like that.
  Treat yourself, pamper yourself.
  Oh, right! OK!
Next up, some country pottery, a lovely Staffordshire figure of Garibaldi.
It belongs to John here.
  Now, Karen can't be with you, can she?
  No.
  Is she at work?
  She's not very well at the moment.
  Get well soon, Karen.
  We're looking at £70 £100.
  Yeah.
I hope we get that top end and I'm pretty sure this is late Victorian,
in fact, early 20th century.
  It's not as early as you thought it was.
  No.
  Do you agree with that?
I do, but it's still a nice figure, quite a large one.
Colourful for that period and condition's very good.
Of course, it's Garibaldi.
Wonderful revolutionary, or was he a biscuit? We don't know.
We're going to find out exactly what the bidders think at Stamford right now. This is it.
Lot 415 is a Staffordshire flatback figurine of Garibaldi.
Can we have a look at it?
Been in the family a bit of time, say goodbye.
£30, £30 I'm bid, take five, goes at £35, £40, £45, £50,
£55 £60 £65, £70, £75, £80, £85, £90, at £90 down there,
it's sold seated, all done at £90... five, £100 I've got,
  £105 I'll take off you, Madam.
£105, I sell down here at £105, finished at £105.
  Fantastic result, £105, the hammer's gone down.
  Got rid of it.
Settle for that, wont you? So who gets the money, you or Karen or Mum?
I think we're going to stop off and have a Chinese, that's about it.
I've just been joined by Ev and it's time to sell some 20th century models.
We've got two drunken bricklayer vases.
Let's hope we get that £900, shall we?
  As long as they make the six, I'll be happy.
  So will I...
then the pressure's off. They're not gonna be yours for much longer, Ev. I promise you that.
This is it, they're going under the hammer.
Lot 317, two Whitefriars drunken brick vases shown there.
Various interest in these. At £400,
It's gonna be a long one, this, Ev.
  This side at 600...
  We've done 600.
  I sell here at 600...
£620, £640, £660, £680, what are you doing on the phones?
£800, £820, £820 on the phone.
£840, £860, £880 on the other phone?
£860 here, I sell on this phone at £860. Finished at £860.
Bang! Yeah, hammer's gone down £860.
  Not bad, top end of the estimate.
  Proper job.
Now we've got something for the purists, from the 18th century.
It's a Lowestoft sauce boat and it is very saucy, it's gorgeous.
Belongs to Tina...not for much longer. £200 £300 is riding on this.
  Yes.
  Firstly I want to know, why are you flogging this, because it's been in the family a long time?
Well, it's been in the family forever, but I've only got one piece
and to build up a collection, you need to be really serious.
  I want it to go to a collector.
It is a particularly nice piece for collectors. It's is an exquisite one
and with the bit of provenance with the early catalogue piece,
  it ties it back to the early  20th century, so it is...
  It's a hardy survivor, isn't it?
  It is.
  Aren't they amazing?
  Gosh, yes.
I mean, it's been moved so many times.
These are big business, the collectors adore them and I just hope they're here today in Stamford.
  We're gonna find out now. This is it... I don't think we need fingers crossed.
  You don't?
  No, I don't. We're confident.
  Absolutely.
  Right...
  This is it.
Lot 427 is the Lowestoft sauce boat.
Nice little sauce boat showing there. £100 for it, £100 I'm bid.
At 100, 110 now, £120, £130, £140,
At £200 on my right.
I sell then at £200 now, it's a pretty little thing.
£210 on the phone, £220, £230, £240,
At 320... I'll take your £330. 330... Do they want £340 now?
340... Oh, go on, you're this close.
£350, fill it up to £350. £340 I sell on the phone then, anybody else?
Goes on the phone at £340.
  He's sold it, hammer's gone down, £340.
  Excellent.
  Now is the money going to the grandchildren?
  No!
I don't know!
  No, no...
  Money's going to Tina.
  Me, it's the Tina fund, yes.
Now we British are truly an island race and the sea has always played
a crucial role in King's Lynn's development and prosperity.
Situated as it is, on the river Rouse estuary, the town has always been an important working port.
It was only in the 19th century, with the advent of the railways,
that King's Lynn's prominence as a centre of trade began to wane.
But for many centuries before the industrial revolution, the town boasted a thriving fishing industry.
In fact, there was probably a fishing community here before there was even a town here.
For several centuries, that fishing community lived on the Northern most reaches
of what is now know as King's Lynn, in an area that became known as the North End.
And to find out a bit more about that unique community and its inhabitants,
I've come to this local museum to meet Arthur Painter.
Here we go, Arthur.
Oh, wow, look at this.
Gosh, aren't they tiny?
Arthur, you've got a particular interest in this place, what is it?
Well, my family grew up in this North End area and lived in little cottages, just like this.
My grandfather and grandmother lived around here.
My mother's family were all into fishing
and had been for several generations.
And it was a very close knit community, with a huge amount of inter marriage over the years,
so lots of people were related to each other.
  My own grandmother was one of three sisters who married three brothers.
  Paint the picture back then.
Was this a street? Because there's only two cottages here.
No, this was typical of one of the yards. This was True's Yard.
It was built around 1790, something like that.
There were, at one time, 10 or 12 cottages in this yard, but only two remain now.
There were probably about 60 or 70 people lived inside this tiny little space.
  Gosh, such a close knit community.
  They were all on top of each other.
Did it ever grow and move out into the town, or did the town want to come into this space?
No, it was always an isolated community up this end of town.
And it'd been here about 1,000 years.
It was here before the church was built, which was 1146.
And because of its isolation, I think, that contributed to the way the community formed.
They tended to stay within the community, they married within the community.
In actual fact, ladies were frowned upon if they married outside the North End.
They were encouraged to marry inside the North End.
So really it was quite an embracing, powerful family union here?
Absolutely, family was everything.
What about feuding, because I know families don't get on sometimes?
Well, I think like all families there were fallings out and fallings in.
And I remember as a child, sometimes there would be a huge screaming match out in the street.
The ladies would go at each other hammer and tongs,
but within a few minutes they'd all be friends again.
It was a very rough area, and there were fights down this end of town.
People would not come to the North End unless they had to.
  So it had a bad reputation?
  It had a bad reputation and strangers were spotted straight away.
If there was a fight down here the police tended to come in teams and never at night,
always during the day, when it was safe.
What was the income like and what was their daily routine?
I think most of the daily routine was governed by the tides.
It depended on whether they could work, whether they could eat this week.
If the seas were rough and they couldn't fish, did they supplement their income any way?
They would take any work going anywhere.
They would clean out the rivers, they would sell a barrel of beer from the front room, they would tidy up.
They would do anything to get work.
And occasionally it got so bad they had to go to the workhouse.
Now, these were really proud people and the workhouse, to them, was a stigma worse than prison.
Well, I can't wait to go inside... can we go and have a look? I'll follow you, Arthur.
Was this your grandparents' cottage?
No, but she lived in one exactly like this.
It's tiny!
Yes, they are very small and this is typical of the cottages that were around here.
Just one room up and one room down.
That's incredible. What was the average size of the families?
Well, we know that 11 people lived in here.
We know there was a mother, a father and nine children living here.
You have to remember the physical area of the place.
Because they've got other cottages in the yard and the proximity of families...
They would've been surrounded by aunts and uncles and grandparents.
So the children would move about in shifts.
Eat in one house and sleep somewhere else. It was the only way to do it.
Obviously this is your central heating and your cooking, is it?
Everything was done from one fire.
There's no water in here at all. In fact, there was no water at all when these cottages were built.
People would either drink water from the river, which ran fresh when it was going out.
Or there'd be an old boy come round with a horse and cart and sell you a bucket of water for tuppence.
Eventually they got a tap on in the 1920s, but that was only switched on for about two hours a day.
But even then, that was an enormous luxury.
People would tend to drink water out of the fleets and out of the rivers,
which brought in great loads of cholera and things like that.
It got to be a national scandal at one point, and I think it was even raised in the Houses of Parliament
when some MP said, "The people of Lynn will drink anything,"
but only because they had no choice.
The women would have had to keep everything scrubbed clean.
One of my childhood memories is the ladies in North Street
and Pilot Street scrubbing the step in the morning.
And you would see a nice half moon of scrubbed pavement outside the front door.
So that was all part of their role as well.
And the ladies did lots of other things. There were some wonderful old ladies who used to act as midwives.
And those old ladies were part and parcel of the glue that held the whole thing together.
Yes, you must've felt so safe.
When did the last families move out of here and when were they demolished?
Well, the process had started in the 1930s,
mainly due to the bad conditions and the overcrowding.
It was interrupted by the war, then after the war in the late 1950s, the programme got going again.
So the last families moved probably, around about early 1960s.
It's a shame these communities are disappearing, isn't it?
I think when all the bricks and mortar were pulled down,
nobody gave any thought to the community that existed here.
The community spirit and the families.
So it was one of the things that was lost along with the bricks and mortar
but, at that time, people just didn't realise it.
Thankfully, today the fishing industry is still going strong
but, as Arthur said, the community has been scattered all over the town.
But old North Enders still come back here to meet up and keep the spirit of this place well and truly alive.
It's back to the valuation day and trust Charlie to lay his hands on something a bit out of the ordinary.
It's been a splendid day and this is no exception, Susan.
I saw these across the room and I was wondering to myself, I hope they're not plastic.
And I sped across to the table and indeed, they aren't.
But before I say any more about them, where did you get them from?
From a fairly local auction, an auction house.
An auction? Blimey, recently?
About six months ago, early last year.
And they were lotted up as what?
It was a mixed lot.
They were just peeking out over the top of other brass and whatever.
And what else was in the box lot?
A brass clock, a brass dog.
  And what did you pay?
  The lot was £32.
Have you sold anything else from the boxful?
No, but we kept the clock.
I would say that's about £20, £25, something like that.
So that's good, if we can get you £32 for these, then everything else was free.
Yeah. Except I wouldn't sell, I'd keep them for £32.
I can't believe that you found those there, it's marvellous.
And do you know what they are, or where they come from?
No, when I saw them, all I knew was that
those birds were just beautiful, they jumped off the perch.
Well, they are, I think they're absolutely splendid.
They are Austrian gold plated bronze,
heavy, virtually got all the original paint there.
A little bit tarnished and a bit chipped, but really.
And mounted on this brass, double, what I'd take to be photograph frame, I'm sure it is.
I think probably the brass work is English and these have been imported and made for that.
This may well be Austrian as well.
Do you know how old they might be?
1900, 1910, something like that.
Exactly, what sort of birds are they?
Well, me husband calls them parrots and I call them parakeets.
One of our cunning experts has told me they're galah birds, from Australia.
  So they've gone from Australia to Austria.
  Not quite parrots, are they? And not quite parakeets,
so I'm sure they're galah birds. Lovely colours.
  Well, I think you've turned your £32 into at least £200 to £300.
  Yeah?
£200 to £300's safe. I wouldn't sell them for a penny less than £200.
If you don't get bid £200, don't sell them.
It honestly wouldn't surprise me if somebody wanted to pay £340, £360 for this, I think they're great.
Very appealing, aren't they?
They're marvellous. I'm sure the auctioneers will love it as much as I do. Thank you.
I'm intrigued by this collection of yours, Alan, tell me more about it.
Well, I started collecting postcards a few years ago and on my travels,
I went to this junk shop in Bournemouth.
I got this collection of cards here, not realising that there was a message on six of the cards.
And it wasn't until I got home and unravelled it all, that I realised there was a message.
It's a bit like a jigsaw, isn't it? There's six pieces together.
And from what I make out it says, "Great Northern Hotel, Peterborough, 1919". So it was sent in 1919.
It says, "Met N and M at Manchester at an early hour this morning.
"The weather is quite cold here at present"   sounds like today  
"but we are hoping that by the time you have found these together, it will be warmer.
"With best love, from NP.
  "Sincerely, RE..."
  Toombs.
  "Toombs."
He must've been a traveller and probably stopped at Peterborough,
bought the six cards and wrote them in a line.
And then, every town that he visited, he'd post one.
Then she got the bits and had to put it all together.
  So, he's quite a joker, this chap.
  Yeah, a bit of a character.
I mean for these to be posted in Rugby, Manchester and all kept together...
And then I found them in a junk shop in Bournemouth.
Magically, they're all still together. It's just lovely.
And Miss Phillips, the recipient, was a very lucky lady.
Now, I'm getting excited, because I love any insight into times gone by,
life gone by, the costumes, the old vehicles.
The trams and cars and bicycles and trade carts and things.
It's wonderful photographic scenes you've got here,
of the streets and scenes around Peterborough.
I'm saying all this, so you might be getting excited about value.
Do you know the kind of value you've got here?
I've absolutely no idea about value. Some cards are probably worth more than others.
You're quite right on that one.
The most valuable, individually of the cards will be the ones that have the most action, most interest.
The pretty, pastoral scenes, ones with nothing happening are not of value.
No, they're very common.
But what I would say is, the value in terms of this collection, is the fact that you have in one album,
an overall view of this part of the country at the turn of the century
and into the early 20th century.
A value or pre auction estimate of about £30 to £50 would be realistic.
So, if we put a £30 reserve on, and hopefully they will make that,
but at least if they don't then you've got peace of mind.
  Yes, I'll be happy with that, thank you.
  Thank you. We'll see how we get on.
It'll be interesting, won't it? Thank you.
Rona, and you've brought Gavin along as well. Who owns these?
  I do.
  Yeah, my mum does.
Well, you brought a great bundle of jewellery along and we sifted through it.
We got rid of some rather ordinary bits and we've come across a couple of little gems here,
which I expect you know something about?
Well, all I know is the smaller one belonged to my grandmother.
Where the other one came from, I don't know.
They were both my mother's.
I've looked on the back and they've got a little CH,
which I think is Charles Horner. It was hallmarked in Chester,
  but I couldn't...
  Well done   how did you know they were Chester?
  I looked on the internet and looked up silver marks.
  A little shield?
  And then the three little dots.
  That's right.
They are by Charles Horner. His father started making jewellery in the 19th century.
  He was particularly famous for making thimbles.
  Oh, right.
And then Charles Horner took over and in the early part of the 20th century
was making items like this, which are made of silver,
with this wonderful enamelling on them.
This is the most wonderful, wonderful pendant.
That is more common or garden, it's smaller, a more common pattern.
  But the problem, looking at it, where has the enamel gone?
  I don't know!
Gavin, are you responsible for that?
  Playing football with that round your neck?
  No.
  No,
  he's never had anything to do with them, unfortunately.
  It's a huge shame.
I mean, you can re enamel them, but it's not done to the same quality of workmanship that was done.
It would be hot enamelled, which would be floated onto there
and I don't think you'd ever replicate those fabulous colours.
When you can get the colour here, that wonderful turquoise, blending out of the blue.
Sort of iridescent, almost, it changes with the light.
Just stunning. And you can imagine how wonderful that would've looked.
You've got two panels that are more or less perfect at the top and the rest of it's gone, really.
Nevertheless, because of the name, it has a value and they have a value.
Have you got an idea of what sort of value?
  About £70?
  He said about £70
but I thought maybe this one would be about £30 or £40
and that less, because obviously with the enamel going...
Well, I think even you are a little bit light weight.
I'd like to see them make a bit more.
I think the two will make £100 to £150.
  Oh, that's good. Mmm.
  I feel reasonably confident about that.
But shall we reserve them at £70, which is your figure,
  then everything over and above that will be a bonus, won't it?
  Yeah.
  We'll keep our fingers crossed.
  We will.
A real treasure this   a wonderful gold painted bronze picture frame,
with two beautiful galahs perched on top.
Alan's postcard collection with its intriguing jigsaw message is a fine example of 19th century scenes.
And despite the damage to one of them,
these Charles Horner enamel pendants always make a big splash with the collectors.
We've got Alan, with that wonderful collection of local postcards, £30 to £50.
I love this, I really do. You're a local guy?
Yes, I live just down the road.
Because, I looked through it and it's just down the end there,
Yarwell Church is in there, Nassington.
Anybody that lives in Yarwell, or Nassington, or Fotheringhay...
if they're here today, they're gonna buy this.
And hopefully they're gonna compete against each other
and get auction fever, because that's what it's all about.
That's what we call God, isn't it? Let's face it.
Good luck, it's going under the hammer now.
Auctioneer David Palmer is overseeing today's sale.
Interesting little lot this, I dunno, start at a tenner?
Ten I'm bid.
There at £45, £50, £55, £60, £65,
He lives in Devon!
Where are all you locals, come on?
Sell down there at £80. It goes then at £80, done at £80, no one else?
Yes! Well done.
How long did it take you to put that collection together?
I collected them about 30 years ago and they've sat in a cupboard.
So I thought I'd bring them along to the valuation day.
Why did you stop collecting?
  Got fed up?
  I got married.
Lesson for us all there.
Something for the ladies now, it belongs to Rona. You've brought your son, Gavin, Hi, Gavin.
Charles Horner, wonderful, lovely piece of jewellery.
Let's hope we get the top end of Charlie's estimate.
I hope so   bit of damage on one of them, though.
We'll get that top end, won't we?
  Is the money going to Gavin?
  Yeah.
No, and his brother, Craig, it'll be shared between them.
  Where's Craig today then?
  He's just behind us.
  There he is, there's Craig.
OK, it's going under the hammer right now, this is it.
Lot 489,
two silver Art Nouveau necklaces.
Couple of them there, quite fun. Charles Horner.
Start 50 quid?
£50 I'm bid, take five now.
Done then, on a main bid of £50.
Five, £60, £65, £70,
Got the £100 figure. That's our lowest.
£160 now, I sell at the front.
That's gone down, short and sweet.
£160! Did you hear that, £160.
  So what's Mum going to get out of this?
  Not a lot!
I love this next lot, I would love to own it
and I dream of finding something like it and paying as much as Susan did for it.
  How much was it?
  £32 for a box of junk in an auction room.
What auction room let that go?
We won't say. We won't embarrass them, will we, Charlie?
All I can say, this gold painted bronze is absolutely stunning. I love the two little birds.
They're wonderful, there's no maker's signature on there,
but the quality and the paintwork is still super for 100 years old.
And it's a decorator's piece, isn't it? It's got the look.
Well, has it got the price? We're going to find out right now.
Lot 478 is the bronze double photograph frame,
modelled as two birds, or budgies or cockatiels, or whatever.
Interesting little lot, let's start at a couple of hundred quid.
£200 I'm bid, straight in.
£200, £220, £240, £260, £280, £300 here.
This is great, they love it.
But we want more!
Was it a come and buy me, Charlie?
I don't know, I thought I was trying to be accurate.
  Money, money.
  This is beginning to smack of incompetence, isn't it?
We've got the four figures.
£1,100 here.
I'll wake up in a minute.
£1,100 in the room, it goes in the room then at £1,100.
Come and buy me!
  Come and sack me!
  I sell over there at £1,100.
  That's brilliant.
  You would've settled for £300. Who's this?
This is Janet who, when I was bidding for them in the auction, I normally bid, like, £10 for things.
  When I stopped at £20, she took over.
  Oh, well done you.
And when she turned around and said, "Do you still want them?" and I went, "Yes."
So I wouldn't have had them if not for Janet, so...
It's such a lot of money! What are you gonna do with it?
I was hoping to book a holiday, but that will more than pay for it.
  Are you taking Janet?
  Well...! Off to Ireland in a cottage.
Oh, the luck of the Irish. Charlie, that's fantastic.
Quality always sells, that's what it's all about.
I hope you've enjoyed the show.
See you next time on Flog It for plenty more.
Marvellous.
