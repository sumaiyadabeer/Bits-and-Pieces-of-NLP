  Oi! That's a person.
  I beg to differ with you there.
  He's got a point.
  You should be helping her up.
What, and risk her crying assault? No, the police can deal with this.
OK, I'll move her, OK?
I'm going to get myself a cup of coffee. If she's there when I return...
No, she won't be.
Come on, Shirley, darling.
  Come on, Shirl, you can't stay here. Come on.
  Leave me alone.
Mate. Her breath reeks!
Lister's right, you know, you should just leave her there.
Since when were you two buddies?
It's called compassion, Kim.
And since you woke up in a skip, I'm surprised you're so quick to judge.
What about the shop?
I don't know, I'll swap shifts with Zainab or something.
Well, you can leave me out of it.
Because I just got these done last night
and I'm not going to ruin them for her.
  This is just typical of you. Typical.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  Come on, Shirley.
  D'you need a hand?
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.
  Come on, Shirley.
  What?
  Come on, darling.
Yeah, it's Christian.
Come on, darling, here we go. Come on. Come on.
There you go.
It's me. What time you getting here?
Yeah, well, make sure you do.
Scarlett asleep?
  Finally.
  Good.
What was that?
What was what?
Well, you just put something in your pocket.
I put lots of things in my pocket when I'm going to work.
Wallet, keys, phone...
It'll get better, I promise.
Why can't I stay here with you?
Well, cos school's important.
  And Mummy's got work at the club, hasn't she?
  Pleeeeease!
Ah, let him stay at home.
He'll only start bunking off if he hates it that much.
I think I know what's best for him, thanks, Kat.
Just get me another bottle and put me back where you found me.
You need food, you need something to soak up all that booze.
She's already infested my home. You want bed bugs in here, too?
  Come on, you don't know it was her!
  What you looking at?
You want to have a go at someone, try me.
  Come on, baby, let's get you to school.
  But Mum...
No, we're going. No buts! Go, go, go.
OK, I tell you what, we'll do a shower first, food later.
And stick them clothes in the wash an' all.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Come on, Shirley. I'm surprised you're still here.
We've all seen Alfie's sign.
If Syed did something as sweet as that for me,
I'd be back home like a shot, bed bugs or no bed bugs!
Come on, darling.
Good luck.
You really reckon you can beat me?
You're looking at the poker king.
I reckon you'll be good at that, Jay.
Cos you have to know how to lie, don't you?
Not even going to say hello?
You all right, Shirl?
I'm never better.
Don't need to ask how you are though, eh. Ticketyboo.
  That's not true.
  True?
What would you know about the truth?
What's that on your hands, Jay?
Oh, yeah, blood.
What's the point, eh?
Yeah, go on, run!
Not one of your better ideas.
You all right?
Yeah. What's up?
Well, I thought you might want to spend a bit of time with Scarlett.
Yeah. Oh, now?
I'm a bit indisposed. Got a few appointments and stuff.
Well, I'm sure me and Billy could cover it, can't we, Billy?
Yeah, yeah. Go on, give her a break.
Lola's shattered and she's half her age. No offence.
He's right, I'm exhausted, Michael.
Please, if you don't do it for Scarlett, then do it for me.
Bye bye, sweetpea.
I knew it!
You all right?
Oww.
Sorry.
You're no Nicky Clarke, are you?
You seen the state of his hair?
Why you being nice?
I don't know, I must be going soft in my old age.
Saint Denise to the rescue. Ain't I lucky.
Well, I don't see the point in kicking someone when they're down.
And let's face it, eh, we've all been there.
But you know what, you don't give up.
Look what's happened to Ian.
Yeah, well, I ain't like him. I would've done the job properly.
Oi, don't start talking like that!
Five years ago, I would have put the bottle
back in your hand and told you to just get on with it. But now...
Now what? What's changed?
Oh, I have.
And so have you, whether you like it or not.
Now, you've made a lot of mistakes, Shirley, in the past,
with Kevin and with your kids, yeah,
but in your own kind of messed up way,
you've done your best to put it right.
And that's the best that any of us can do, innit?
Don't mean I like you though.
Here you are.
Finish your coffee, I'll go and sort you a room out.
Dee, Dee.
I understand you're trying to do the right thing, but what about Jay?
He's just getting back to his old self.
OK. OK, so it's not easy for him,
but none of that's Shirley's fault, is it?
Look, look, now she's sobering up,
I think she'll be a lot more reasonable.
But they're never going to sort things out
if they don't at least face each other, are they?
Alfie?
Alfie?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Where you going?
  Where d'you think I'm going? I'm moving back in.
  No, you can't.
The place ain't habitable for another day.
The B&B won't be either if Shirley sticks about.
I don't think it's right that we're over there and you're here.
Sweetheart, and I miss you both loads, OK,
but you can't do nothing till tomorrow.
Now go and enjoy the sun. Go on.
You can't breathe in the fumes! Go on.
Go, go, go, go, go! I'll talk to you later, all right?
Love you.
It's meant to be my day off.
What can I do? She's dumped her on me,
and she's getting grouchy cos it stinks of boys in here.
All you have to do is just keep an eye out.
Pop in, pop out, you know the deal.
All right, fine, but you owe me.
Yeah, yeah, fair enough.
So it's just a normal training schedule today.
All this lot are in.
Got that usual guy coming over for the security system.
You couldn't take him over the R&R, could you?
  Cos the alarm's playing up.
  See, now you're pushing it, ain't ya?
Fair enough. I'll just let Sharon deal with it.
She's over there on her jack but there you go, it's all right.
All right, leave it with me.
You never could resist a blonde, could you?
They ain't all blondes, mate. You just take care of your daughter.
Maybe if you told me what you're looking for I could help you.
I've been looking all over the place for you.
Come back to the B&B now, man.
Look, Shirley will calm down, y'know.
I ain't scared of her.
Then come back with me, let's play cards like we planned.
Don't really feel like it. Maybe tomorrow.
Denise offered Shirley a room. You OK with that?
  If she's staying, I should leave.
  And what'll that prove?
Listen to me, son, running away, it's never the answer.
Shirley don't need me in her face, reminding her.
Is that what you're really worried about,
or is it that she's going to be in YOUR face, reminding YOU?
Look, now, man, I loved Heather like a daughter, you know that.
You think it was easy for me to forgive you?
No, of course not.
But I did. Because you told the truth in the end.
And the right person is now in jail.
Look, once Shirley's thinking straight,
she'll realise that you're just as much a victim as she is.
And everything can go back to how it was before?
No. No.
But maybe if you look her in the eyes and tell her you're sorry...
..you can both find some peace.
I'm trying to find out if a company cheque has been cashed yet.
It's Â£20,000.
Cheque number is 004521.
Well, how long does it normally take?
Thanks for nothing!
I told you, if he only wrote it today,
it won't have gone through, will it?
Yes, thank you, Billy!
Here's an idea, it might seem a bit radical,
but why don't you just ask Michael what he wants the money for?
  Yeah, cos it's that simple, right.
  Well, yeah, it could be.
Says the relationship expert.
Hear the boy out.
Oh Dee, Dee, Dee, Jay's back.
Go on, then, say what you've got to say.
Look, I could make a million excuses for what I did.
Covering up for Ben.
But there ain't a million excuses, is there?
All I can say is I'm sorry.
I really am.
But I haven't got off lightly like you think I have.
It haunts me every minute of every day...
..just like you said it would.
I just can't stop thinking about Hev...
..how she went quiet all of a sudden...
..how she looked after...
  I can't hear anything.
  Maybe that's a good sign.
You stand there and you tell me how bad you feel.
What do you want me to say? "There, there, Jay. Poor little Jay"?
I want you to feel bad for the rest of your life!
Just let him go, Shirley!
You and Ben being put away for ever is not enough for me.
I'd like to see you swing for what you did.
  Let him go, Shirley!
  All right, all right, all right.
Jay, just leave us alone. Please leave us alone.
Shirley, you can't go on like this. It's going to eat you up inside.
She's right.
And Jay...he's just a kid.
Don't be fooled by that. He's old enough to take responsibility.
He knows more than anybody what it's like to lose someone.
Yes, but he's lost someone too. He's lost Hev!
And his mum and his dad and Phil, and now you.
Oh, Shirley, look, enough lives have been ruined by this already,
what's the point in ruining another?
I am not... I'm not going to turf Jay out, Shirley,
so if you're going to stay here
then you're just going to have to find a way to forgive him.
So, just to clarify then in my tiny little mind,
you're freaking out cos I wrote a mysterious cheque.
Only, it's not mysterious, because I filled the exact, precise amount
in the stub and then put the cheque book back in the drawer
where the cheque book lives.
Fine, so why did you act so shifty when I came in this morning?
  I didn't.
  Yes, you did. And you said that you had appointments all day.
I looked in the book, you didn't have any.
Look, I just need to know what you are spending my money on!
Ah, there you go. Well done. Your money. Lest we forget.
Why don't you come with me. Come on. Come on.
What? What are you doing?
OK, that's what I'm talking about.
That's what I was going to pick up this afternoon.
I don't understand.
That'll be a Porsche then. It's a present.
Surprise.
I can't forgive him, I haven't got it in me.
All those lies that he told. What me and Andrew,
Dot and you, what we went through, not knowing,
nothing can make that right.
Well, if that's how you feel,
then maybe you don't need to just leave this house. Well, you know...
..maybe you need to think about just leaving Walford.
Yeah, before it screws you up for good.
  Hang on.
  No, don't you see, Patrick, that being here,
she's just stuck in limbo?
Shirley, every time you look at Phil and Jay,
and you think about Hev and what happened,
then, darling, you're never going to move forward, are you?
You need to give yourself a chance to heal, somewhere new.
Yeah.
I don't need another car.
Since when d'you limit yourself to things you need?
We can't even get the kid in it.
She'll be fine.
Most men buy flowers when they've got a guilty conscience.
God only knows what this means that you've been up to.
When I married you, I promised you a beautiful, perfect life,
full of beautiful, perfect things. And that's what this car signifies.
Me trying to make good on that promise, yeah,
it's a sexy, sleek car for my sexy, sleek wife.
It's Â£20,000 of MY money.
It's a little bit excessive, don't you think?
And which friend did you say you got it from anyway?
You know what? If you don't like the car, flog it!
So where you going to go, your sister's?
I ain't thought that far.
Wait a minute.
It ain't much, but...
I can't take your cash.
Come on. It'll help.
Please.
Thank you, Denise.
Well, it's...
It's been interesting knowing you.
Been through a lot together, ain't we?
Come here.
I truly hope you find some happiness somewhere, you know?
  Wherever you go.
  Thank you.
Here, you can put those towels she used in the wash
with some of this, yeah.
It's for pets but I think it can be used for humans.
Kim, I brushed her hair, there were no bugs!
Look, I ain't taking no chances!
It'll get better, Denny, I promise.
Now, Michael isn't here, so you can spend all afternoon with Mummy.
Now, I've got to count the bottles in the bar,
so why don't you do some nice drawings for me, eh?
And if you miss me too much, you can see me on the TV,
  but I'll come back to check on you, OK, darling?
  Good boy.
Sharon?
No, he's not in today.
Yeah, all right, I'll pass on the message. Yeah, bye.
Shirl.
I'm leaving Walford.
But before I go, I think we should have a drink and a chat.
Shirl, we can't keep opening up old wounds.
It's not good...for either of us.
Never were much of a talker, were you?
How about a drink, then? Wouldn't deny me that, would you?
For old time's sake.
Oh, babe, it is crawling with bugs in there.
They reckon that's where it started.
So unless Shirley slept there last night,
looks like she's innocent after all.
Can't all be bad.
The other boys ignore me.
What about the girls?
One's OK. Her name's Evie. She let me have some of her sweets.
Well, that's a start.
There's nothing wrong with getting in with girls, believe me.
She pretty?
S'pose.
  I'll bet she's not as pretty as your mum.
  She's the best.
Yeah, she's the most important person in your life.
But you've got to be your own man an' all,
that means making an effort at school.
Cos the better you fit in there,
the sooner your mum's going to stop worrying about you.
  I wondered where you'd been hiding!
  Dirty under there. You want to get the cleaners on it.
Can I have a word please, Jack? Outside.
You ever need to talk, uncle Jack's always here.
Won't be a minute, baby, OK?
What's wrong with you?
This is good stuff, it's the best.
I got it specially. And you won't even have one glass?
You know that I can't.
Next you'll be telling me that you don't even think about it any more.
Don't tell me that you're not longing for one mouthful.
Maybe I should have bought some crack,
wouldn't say no to that, would you?
A crack comedown, that'd bring you somewhere close to my level.
Is that what this is all about, getting me in the same state as you?
Well, I'm already there, Shirl. Cos I've lost everything too, haven't I?
You think I like rattling around this place on my own?
Ain't enough.
You ain't on your knees...
..you ain't broken.
You wanted me back here, well, here I am!
But this time, for once, it's going to be on my terms.
Go on, Phil. Just one mouthful.
To prove to me that it weren't all a lie.
If you loved me, you would.
It's because I love you that I can't.
This isn't the way, Shirley.
Fine.
More for me.
  I was just trying to help!
  He doesn't need any self appointed uncles dishing out advice.
And one night of passion does not qualify you for the job, understood?
All right, I stepped out of line.
Too right you did.
That was one hell of a night though, weren't it?
I'd say average.
Come on, it was more than average!
Right now, there's only room for one man in my life, Denny.
So if you don't mind...
Well, I've got somewhere I've got to be anyway.
But don't think I'm giving up, cos right now ain't for ever, is it?
Where are you? Good.
Well, she ain't at the B&B no more, she's at mine.
So get here as soon as you can.
I need to get out of here.
No, stay. Where else you going to go?
Anywhere. Anywhere away from you.
Shirl, stay. We can talk, like you wanted to, yeah?
Yeah all right, hold on, hold on.
You all right? Kat, sweetheart? What you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.
We're coming home, all right! We miss you, I miss you.
I'm not spending another night over there again.
  We belong here, all of us.
  I know, I know.
I'll even wear this if I have to.
Come here, you big softie.
Do you want to come to Daddy? Come on.
Tell you what, I suppose I could probably
put some beds in the hallway, make it a bit safe for us, eh?
As long as you promise though to wear this when we're on our own.
  You little minx.
I don't want no help, I've told you!
Carly?
Same old Mum.
Carly.
Carly! Don't go! Please, don't go.
