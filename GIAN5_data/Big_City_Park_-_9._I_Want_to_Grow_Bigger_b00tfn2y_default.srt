Let's go on a treasure hunt A very special day
  In the big Big City Park
  Big City Park!
So come along Let's have a great time today
  In the big Big City Park
  Big City Park!
Pay close attention, Billy.
Before your very eyes, I am going to make this twig
disappear.
Oh! Gone. He he he!
You just threw it over your shoulder.
It still made it disappear, didn't it? He he!
Ha ha ha!
  Ha ha ha!
  Ha ha ha!
Hello. Lovely to see you here in Big City Park.
And what are you pair laughing at?
Ruairi was just showing me a trick.
He can make things disappear.
Well, maybe you can help me with this, then, Ruairi.
What have you done to your top, May?
It's tiny! Ha ha!
  I shrunk it in the wash, Billy.
  I can't help you there.
That's so small it wouldn't fit wee Billy!
I'm not that small.
Of course you are,
but you wouldn't want to be too big, Billy, would you?
  Oh, here's Dara and her friends, now!
  Hi, Dara.
Hi, May!
  Hi, Chloe!
  Hi, May!
  Hi, Max!
  Hi!
  Hi, Emily.
  Hi!
Are you looking forward to having fun in Big City Park?
Yes!
Big City Park!
Here we are!
A bag for Chloe.
And a bag for Max.
And a bag for Emily.
And if we find anything really special,
maybe we could keep it in Ruairi's treasure chest?
Yes, of course! There's plenty of room in here for special things  
big or small.
A bit like me.
Oh, Billy. Are you OK?
I've just realised
I'm the smallest person here.
Billy, it's OK to be small.
We all come in different shapes and sizes.
But I want to be as big as everyone else, May.
I want to grow.
But you are growing.
Just a little bit at a time.
You might not even notice.
  Oh.
  That's right, Billy.
Do you remember the time I measured you and Dara
against that tree last year? I bet if we measured you again,
you'd have grown a badger's centimetre. Or two!
I would?
Yes, yes!
I...er...just have to remember where the tree is. Hmm.
In the park, things are growing all the time.
  Shall we go and find some things?
  Yes!
Bags on shoulders.
Bags on shoulders!
Boots on toes.
Boots on toes!
It's exploring time, so...
Off we go!
Come on, then!
  Boo!
  Oh!
  He he he!
Billy!
I found something that's growing, Dara  
this bush.
The bush is growing.
That is because it is spring
and as the weather gets warmer and there is more sun...
..everything grows.
Lots of things start to grow. Right.
Hey, maybe I'll start to grow, too, now it's spring, May.
Maybe you will, Billy.
What have we seen here that grows?
  Trees.
  Flowers.
Will we go and have a look?
Yes!
Let's go. Come on, Billy and Dara.
Max, what do you see growing on this tree?
Leaves and little flowers.
All I can see is wood.
Not there, Billy.
There.
  Oh, yeah!
  Some of the leaves
are just little buds at the moment, but they will grow bigger
until the tree is all red and green.
How do the leaves grow, May?
They need sunlight from above and water from below.
The tree's roots suck up the water.
That's how they grow.
Let's see some more trees. Let's go.
  Coming, Billy?
  Eh, I don't think so, Dara.
I'm down here
and the leaves are way up there. I can't reach them.
Being small is no fun, at all.
What fun can you have when you are small?
  Dara, I think we might need some help to find out.
  On my way, May!
Shall we go and see what else we can find?
  Mm, OK.
  Come on, then!
Hmm, let's see now...
No, it's not that one, that's too brown.
  Hi, Ruairi!
  Ah! Dara!
Just the fox I was hoping to see.
  Could you help? I'm looking for a tree that I lost.
  I don't have time.
I need to find out how my friends have fun, when they're small.
I once had the best time of my life with some very small people.
About this size, they were. I helped them make a boat out of an oak leaf.
Got it! See you, Ruairi!
He he!
Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah! Trees...
Hmm... Right.
Let me see. Hmm...
Here we go!
"We can do fun things
"when we are small"!
That's it! Ha ha ha!
"From the fastest fox in Big City Park,
"to the friendliest friends in the Big City. Tell us what you know!"
  I love playing outside.
  I love playing outside, too.
Through the hole!
This is a very tiny route.
I love going into small places.
I'm walking through this.
I'm definitely going to make it to the top.
I'll go up this ladder.
I nearly am at the top!
This is the most highest place.
Look, look.
  Look there.
  Hi, Mum!
  I'm jumping into this hole.
  Sure you can fit through?
We're going down the hole now!
Whee!
Yeah!
I just went through the hole now.
We're hiding under the slide.
  Finn? Mary Jane?
  Yes?
We can see you!
It's fun playing outside.
  Do you like playing outside?
  We do!
Oh, thank you! Bye!
Big City Park!
  What are you looking for, Billy?
  A watering can, May.
Maybe, if I have lots of sun and some water, like these leaves,
I'll grow, too.
  Billy, guess what I found out?
  What?
  You can do lots when you are small.
  Oh!
My friends in the city
can crawl under things and jump through things.
  They're good at hiding, too.
  We'd better go, then!
  Where to, Billy?
Well, to play hide and seek   before I grow any bigger! Ha!
  I'll count!
  And we'll hide!
One, two, three,
four, five, six,
seven, eight,
nine, ten.
Well, if that's not
the finest looking plate of blueberry muffins I've ever seen.
He he he.
I wonder who made those? Oh, yes!
It was me!
Ha ha ha ha!
Found you! Ha ha!
I could see the top of your head, May.
You're much bigger than everyone else.
Who are we missing?
Billy!
Let's go and find him.
Sshh!
Sshh!
Sshh!
Sshh!
Ssh... Oh.
  Sshh!
  He must be in a really good hiding place.
I can't see him anywhere(!)
  Hello, Billy!
  A ha ha!
You found me! Ha ha ha!
  How did you get in there, Billy?
  It's easy when you're small, Dara.
And guess what? I found some
  friends who are even smaller than me!
  They are tiny.
  May?
  Mm.
I found this shell, too.
Wow, let me see.
This is a snail's shell.
The snail lives inside the shell.
How small would you have to be to fit inside?
As small as your little finger, I would think.
  Small as your little finger?
  Smaller, actually.
Even I couldn't fit in there, May!
Oh, they should be here by now.
Maybe they got carried away with all the stuff growing here.
I'll give them a call.
Well, would you look at that!
That's where I measured Billy and Dara  
against my own tree!
Argh!
  Oh!
  That's Ruairi calling us to the Story Circle.
Shall we go?
Yeah!
Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!
Oh, why do I always forget the racket that makes? Oh!
I have a special treat for you two.
I found the tree where I measured you last year.
  Ah!
  Come on over.
Let's see if you've sprouted.
Ho ho! Measure me, measure me!
OK. Up against the tree.
Let's see...
Well, would you look at that!
You've grown!
You'll soon be catching up with young Dara.
  I don't want to grow too big.
  Well, why is that, Billy?
  Ha!
Because then I'll be rubbish at hide and seek   like May!
Thanks, Billy(!)
  You must be hungry after all that running. Tuck in!
  Thanks, Ruairi!
Ahem ahem ahem.
Now, Billy didn't like being small, he thought he wasn't growing at all,
but with his friends, he learned to see, that everything grows,
like you and me.
Some things are big, some are small,
some things, you can hardly see at all
but on his journey, he learned today,
no matter what size you are,
you can have fun on the way.
Well done, Ruairi!
Shall we put our snail shell in Ruairi's treasure chest?
Yes!
In you go!
Safe and sound!
I'm really glad the snail shell is in the treasure chest, Ruairi.
  Why is that, Billy?
  If a snail ever needs a house,
  they'll know where to find one!
  Ha ha ha!
It's been another fun day in Big City Park.
  Join us again soon.
  Who wants to see one of my famous magic tricks?
Me!
This is called The Famous Disappearing Twig Trick.
Watch closely.
Ha ha ha!
Gone!
Magic! Gone!
