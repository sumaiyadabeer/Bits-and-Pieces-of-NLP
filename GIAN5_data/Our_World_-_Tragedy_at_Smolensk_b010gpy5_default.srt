and his entire cabinet one year ago. How has the tragedy changed bowl
and's relationship with Russia.    It is the darkest Place, on the
edge of a Russian forest where they perished. That morning
that we saw each other for a second at 5am. We said nothing. It was our
last glance. Her poll up! Terrain they headed!
My husband's friend called and told my daughter that
the President's plane had crashed. I think about my
brother many times each day. He is my twin brother so somebody very
dear to me. I ask what could have been done to avoid the disaster.
Has a brother was one of 96 to go and was bowled and's President.   
has been no healing. Poland was the nation that led Eastern Europe out
of communism there yet now, and it's this post communist decade, it
is struggling with the legacy. The crash has confronted Poland with
all its old nightmares   of Russian Warsaw, just before 7:30am. The
Polish President and his wife, political colleagues, military and
civilian leaders are aboard the presidential plane. Destination:
Smolensk, Russia. In the cockpit, all is well. This is the Russian 
recordings we will here actual My husband said... I
remember his face. And how much it meant to him. He so wanted to go.
Her husband was Polland's deputy defence minister. He and others
were making a pilgrimage to the site of one of the worst atrocities
of the 20th century. 22,000 Polish prisoners of war were murdered and
brightest   offices and intellectuals, doctors and teachers.
Most were executed here, in the forests. 70 years on, the Russian
tribute to the death. For many Polish, it was vindication.
It could be seen that the Russians were ready to kneel
before the truth an a physical sense, that is what happened.
three days after this historic moment, a second delayed nation
would be on rich for their own commemoration. They would not make
it. Coming to you live from Moscow and we begind we beginking news.
The plane carrying the President... It was exactly 8:48am, seven
minutes after the crash. It was the head of the Eastern Department of
the foreign ministry. He said that the presidential plane crashed but
there was no explosion. My father in law
called and asked if he had gone and the plane. He said, the plane has
The Foreign Minister called me. I was at home. I was
about to leave for hospital to The Prime Minister called an
emergency meeting of the Cabinet and she was outside of Warsaw as
well so we were all speeding its awards Warsaw and it was in the car
that my Co workers passed on to meet the list of all of those who
died. It turned out I knew almost all of them. Only 12 miles away,
this was another Polish tragedy on Russian soil. Within hours, at the
Dos May premiers were together again at the scene.    two
premieres. A did not pay much attention to Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin although he was also devastated. He tried to be as warm
as possible which is unusual for him because he is not an emotional
person. So why did a flight carrying pole and's head of state
and scores of the eyepiece end in disaster?    of the eyepiece.
Halfway through the journey, the flight crew are warned of fog that

the runway at Smolensk is on a platter but the approach is via a

they would 20 metres above the ground when in fact they were 10
metres below the runway. The impact was inevitable. The Russians have
laid his sole blame on the Polish flight crew but there polish say it
is too simple. Polish investigators believe that Russian traffic
control was too slow to warm the Some in Poland from the opposition
party go even further and directly blame at the Russians. Chief among
the accuses is that did President's brother. I can say
that decisions made by the Russians contributed to this catastrophe. It
was something done on purpose or The President and his wife had died
together and but for a family illness, his twin brother would
have been with them. I wanted my brother to take the train
there. I constantly feel guilty that I did not force him to take
the train. The Koschitzke family were always super high achievers.  
  less Kissinger the's family was always very special. At one point
while he was president, his brother was Prime Minister. Except for a
mother, nobody knew him as well as I did. His twin brothers we were
very close and constantly thinking of each other. The thoughts do not
stop. They are personal memories, not political. Other families feel
the same. This man was the director of protocol at Poland foreign
ministry and he was also a husband and a father. He dealt
with all our problems and there was nothing he could not solve. He
In a land where they say any two people will form at least three
political factions, unity was not to last. Some instinctively smelt
an outside plot. and this unity was a blessing for polls,
but very dangerous for our neighbours. Russia and Germany.
Polland had always been a tasty morsel and both had fought for it.
Strong independent Poland has been a threat to them. D'Cruz, a symbol
of nationhood in this Catholic land, was placed outside the Presidential
Palace. It became a rallying point with the Polish government accused
of allowing a Russian cover up of the courses of the crash. The
government said the demonstrations were unseemly and move the cross to
a church elsewhere in Warsaw. Their opponents say this is yet another
sign of weakness. With some believing Polland was once again
Russia's victim, all the rancour concealed by two decades of post
communism re emerged. The final moments of PLF 101. The terrain
warning system picks on in the cockpit.    picks on. The alarm
sounds: Pull up. The Captain tries sounds: Pull up. The Captain tries
to abort. How long were they are alive knowing that
they would die? I hope it was quick. The Russian investigator's report
contains no comfort. One cause of the crash was said to be pressure
on the crude to land despite the fog.    pressure on the Pru. T
years previously the President had accused a pilot of the cowardice
for refusing to land. The first officer and the Navigator of that
flight were on that ill fated flight to Smolensk. The Russian
reports stated that on the spine    smut length flight his voice was
heard to. It suggests that when the pilot says there is fog his
response: So we have a problem, may have weighed heavily. The protocol
chief was Mariusz Kazana. For his family the Russian speculation has
been further torment. I put the television on and heard
Mariusz Kazana. It was such a shock. No one asked us to identify his
boys. As if that boys had been a cause of the crash. You Reserve
could Kinski has been quick to the defence of his late colleague.
As Prime Minister I had flown on that plane hundreds of
times. It was quite normal for the head of protocol to enter the
cockpit and inquire about the situation. So when he said: We have
a problem, this is fog, he was just stating facts. For Russia's part,
their Foreign Minister told us they have no doubt. Their findings are
definitive. The investigation is unprecedented plea transparent. The
experts and the prosecutors and the facts are available. It is not
about whether these facts are blaming anyone on not. Those are
the facts. It is for the professionals to look into that.
Polish officials tell a different story, saying that their access to
events that's balanced was sometimes tonight.    events at
Smolensk. It smacks of Russian conspiracy and cover up. I do not
insisted was a coup, but a do not rule that out. The plane was of it,
the airport was Russian, the traffic controllers were Russian.
Be people in charge of security were also Russian. The
investigators were also Russian. Pollen's premier says there is no
Russian plot, but Russian pride. They have hidden their own faults,
but they always do. I would be lying if I said I was
counting on the Russian investigation to be objective.
However, there committee statements describing negligence or mistakes
on the Polish side are not that far from the truth. But they failed to
mention what is also evident: Russian responsibility. He is
talking about air traffic control at Smolensk, and the view that the
warnings came too late. The Russians are
trying to cover up, not because of some dark secret, but it is the
traditional Russian unwillingness to admit their mistakes or
witnesses. Tragedy for Polland and political drama. After T' decays
polls find themselves once again emerged in the old debate: How to
handle the Russians. Donald tusk has created a situation
where people are asking questions. Pollen has been thrust into the
Russian sphere of influence. I can understand that
the brother of the President so tragically killed is still bitter
about what happened. But added not accept what he says. Yeah Reserve
could Kinski's long standing dislike of the Russians and the
political rivalry between he and I have often led to disputes. It is
something I have to live with. Jaroslaw Kochanski. There is the
poignant task of carrying on. Sometimes she asks which card to
leave. Buy to let to leave them all. Her father will choose. It was the
worst here in my life and the good years will never return. I do not
