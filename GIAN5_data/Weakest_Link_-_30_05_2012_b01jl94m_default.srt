Here are today's nine contestants
preparing for the show.
Only one of them will go home
with the prize money of up to £10,000.
The others will leave with nothing
as their team mates vote them the weakest link.
Welcome to The Weakest Link.
Any of the nine people in the studio here today could win up to £10,000.
They don't know each other, however, if they want the prize money, they'll have to work as a team.
we lose the player voted the weakest link.
Let's meet the team.
I'm Dave. I'm a 42 year old sales representative from Blyth in Northumberland.
My name is Cathy. I'm 38, from County Down and I work in a homeless hostel.
I'm Matt. I'm 24, and I'm a service technician from Birmingham.
I'm Pat. Aged 56, from Romford in Essex.
I'm a club entertainer and singer.
I'm Lyssa. I'm a 28 year old account manager from Cheshire.
I'm Stella. I'm 50 years of age. Local government officer and I come from Manchester.
I'm Dan. I'm 30 and I'm a civil servant from Cardiff.
I'm Eva. I'm 60. I'm retired from the civil service.
I come from Elstree in Hertfordshire.
I'm Mark. I'm 36. I'm a driving instructor from Liverpool.
Now the rules.
In each round, aim to answer
enough questions to reach your £1000 target.
The fastest way is to create a chain of nine correct answers.
If you get a question wrong, you break the chain and lose all the money.
But if you bank it before the question is asked,
the money is safe, but you start a brand new chain.
Remember, at the end of the round,
only money that has been banked can be taken forward. In Round One,
there are three minutes. We'll start with the first name alphabetically.
That's you, Cathy. Let's play The Weakest Link.

But...who is holding you back?
Who is causing you a problem?

than appearing on it?
One of you is about to leave with nothing. It's time to vote off the weakest link.
The only player to answer all of his questions correctly is Dave.

Statistically, you were the weakest link.
And with five votes, you've been voted it. Goodbye.
The volcano question, I would've got right if I didn't feel pressured,
if I'd had more time. But while you're stood up there,
you think about time and time being wasted.

as I did, but he didn't bank any money.

Time is up, though,
and of the £1000 available in that round, you won £440.
But who is now out of the running? Who should be making a fast exit?
Who is a grave disappointment? Who is costing you money?
One of you is about to go with nothing. It's time to vote off the weakest link.
Having answered all of his questions correctly and banked £200 for the team,
Matt is the strongest link in this round.
Cathy is this round's worst player.
But will the rest have noticed?
Voting over, it's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
You actually got nine correct answers in a row.
So if you'd banked intelligently, you could've reached your £1000 target.
But you didn't, did you, Pat?
  No.
  You want to get rid of Cathy, do you?
Not particularly. She's nice. She got a few questions wrong,
  and I thought she seemed to be the weakest link to me.
  Right.
  How's it going for you, Dan?
  All right.
  You do a bit of dancing?
  Erm, I try not to.
  Right.
But you thought in America in the '40s they were all jigging, did you?

Slightly worse, you'll be pleased to hear.
  How's it going for you, Mark?
  All right, yeah.
  Why Cathy?
  I think she got two wrong.
  Right. Just one more than you.
  One more than me, yeah.
  Right.
Cathy, what happened to you in that round?
I haven't a clue, Anne.
That's why statistically you were the weakest link,
and with four votes, you're voted out. Goodbye.
I could've played better. It's a new experience. You're under pressure.
When you're at home, it seems that much easier there's nobody looking at you.
I think Dan should be voted off next, because I think Dan nearly did as bad as me.
Maybe he banked something, I don't know. But he should go next.
Round Three, and of the £2000
you could've won by now, you've put in the kitty £840. Seven of you left.
There's ten seconds less.
We'll start with last round's strongest link Matt. Let's play The Weakest Link.

  I'm a sales rep.
  Are you?
  You don't like women?
  Nothing wrong with women at all.
  Why have you voted for Eva, then?
  She got two questions wrong
  and she collapsed a bit.
  You thought Eva was the weakest link?
  I did.
She wasn't, was she, Pat?
I had a terrible round. Terrible.
Why Eva?
I couldn't vote for myself. I know I got a lot of questions wrong.
Eva, you weren't the worst statistically but there's nothing fair here.
With four votes, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I was disappointed I was voted off, because I wasn't the weakest link.
It was Pat. However, I did get two questions wrong.
The hardest thing about playing The Weakest Link
is that your heart starts to pound, your mouth goes dry,
and you can't think.
Round Four.
£1050 banked so far out of potential prize money of £3000.
So huge scope for improvement.
Six of you left and ten more seconds off the clock. You now have only 2½ minutes.

He got a couple of questions wrong.

  That's right.
  OK. Mark,

  What happened to you, Dan?
  Nightmare of a round.
Did you come on the right quiz show?
  Yeah. With a fair wind I would have done all right.
  No wind in this studio.
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I think they voted me off because my name's Dan and it's easy to spell.
I had a really bad round and I deserved to be voted out.
If I hadn't been, I think I could have gone on to win it.
Pat should go. He's really ruthless. He's just in it for the money.
Round Five.

I deserved to get voted off. I was very lucky two rounds ago
because I was the weakest link. Having got so far,
I would like to have got a bit further.
Matt will probably be the next one off.
Though all four are playing very well.
Round Six. There's £1370 in the kitty out of a possible £5000.

I just thought he got a couple wrong.
Matt, bicycles.
Did you suppose in the early 19th century, everyone was a trick cyclist(?)
  Probably.
  Not two wheels until 1839?
  Yeah.
  You didn't get one right in that round.
  I know.
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
The bicycle question two wheels. I'm never going to live it down.
It was the first thing I thought of.
That's what I said. I think possibly Mark
will go off next, because he hesitates.
I think Lyssa has got a bit more general knowledge.
I think it will be Lyssa and Dave in the final.
Round Seven.
Of the £6000 you could have won, you have £1490. Three of you left.
Ten seconds fewer. The strongest link starts.

Voting over. Time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Dave, why Mark?
I felt Mark was the weakest link and got more questions wrong.
  Not that he'd be worse opposition in the final?
  I didn't think that.
  Lyssa, why Mark?
  A bit of a bad round. He got a couple wrong.
He might be a bit of opposition in the final round.
Mark...how do you feel about being voted off?
Well, it happens.
Well, it was unanimous. Mind you, that's only two votes.
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I am disappointed to get so far and not get through, but I didn't play well.
Nerves came into it. I thought I could have done better.
Out of Lyssa and Dave, it's pretty even.
I'm not sure who'll win. It could go either way.
I think it will be very close. It might even go to sudden death.
Round Eight.
You have £1640
out of a possible £7000.
Dave and Lyssa.
You have 90 seconds. Whatever you win in this round will be trebled
and added to your total to make up your prize money.
So, £3000 at stake.
We start with the strongest link.

You'll now play against each other, head to head. I'll ask alternate questions.
The best of five.
Whoever answers the most correctly wins. If there's a tie, we'll go for sudden death.
So, Dave and Lyssa, for £2000, let's play The Weakest Link.
Lyssa, as the strongest link, you choose who starts.
I'll go first.
Lyssa.

Lyssa.

Dave, you must answer this question correctly to remain in the game.
In the animal kingdom,
the flightless cormorant
lives in which island group off the coast of South America?
The West Indies.
The correct answer is the Galapagos Islands.
That means, Lyssa,
you are today's strongest link and you go away with £2000.
Dave, you leave with nothing.
It was pretty even. I got very lucky.
It could have gone either way.
I feel really disappointed.
I'd done well throughout the whole game.
To get to the last two and walk away with nothing is very upsetting.
It's unbelievable.
It's great to have got through all that and come out as the winner.
