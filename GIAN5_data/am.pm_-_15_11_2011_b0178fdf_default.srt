Good afternoon. Welcome to the programme. Politicians will be
discussing the Assembly Budget today and a budget can still
stretched to get Vaughan Roderick on the sofa later to talk about
what might happen. Before that, we were taking First Minister's
contact us via twitter, or send us The First Minister is on his feet
taking questions from AMs. Let's go over to the Senate macro.
The first item on the agenda is questions from the First Minister.
Rebecca Evans. Will the First Minister make a statement on his
health priorities for Wales. They can be found in the document.
welcome the Welsh Government's effort to reduce suicide in Wales.
How is the Welsh Government assuring local health boards are
engaged with suicide prevention? The action plan identify his local
health boards as those responsible agencies and leads to agencies for
many of the atoms within the plan, so they are crucial to ensuring the
actions are carried out. First Minister, we have all seen
recently the shocking use of long ambulance queues outside a hospital
in my constituency. Although I drew attention to this last week there
were seven ambulances queuing outside on Sunday of this week. I
am sure you will agree, First Minister that this needs urgent and
immediate action. What is your government doing and what are you
doing as First Minister in the short and long term to resolve this,
and how do you think that in health spending as you are doing will
address this very real issue?    cutting health spending. There will
be occasions when a in the departments become very full but
there are few and far between.    accident and emergency departments.
I take no lectures from the party opposite when we see is the
protect the NHS against the predatory instincts of the party
opposite. Simon Thomas. Thank you, presiding officer. To return to
Wales and my local trust area in particular, the government and the
Health Minister had said it is a priority not to close any district
general hospital sites, but what about developing expert surgery   
Surgery expertise on all sides, will it be a priority for you and
your government to ensure a very surgical specialism in every
district general hospital attracting clinical staff and
giving local people confidence that local hospitals are essential for
your health plans in that area. Local hospitals are essential part
of our policies and the way we can insure that there are centres of
specialist surgery in that area.    N Short. It is also important to
ensure that we attract more doctors into the area. It has been a
problem for many years, but they didn't want to go to the west of
Swansea, so the minister Lesley Griffiths has launched a campaign
in order to attract more doctors to Wales and the West. Russell George.
Question 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on his priorities
for halting biodiversity loss? Protecting Eco systems is a
priority for the government, and includes actions such as ecosystem
resilience, diversity and the funding of measures such as those
to improve equality. I welcome the ï¿½1 million funding the government
has recently announced for projects on improving the natural
environment, but does he have a dedicated budget for delivery
against biodiversity loss? The government has missed its 2010
target for halting what biodiversity loss and has new
targets in place for 2020, so would you agree that it is crucial but
there is a commitment from government to ensure enough funding
is to live at to make the targets possible, and they should be a
dedicated line in the Budget? budget doesn't contain one specific
example of funding for biodiversity loss. There are many examples. The
woodland strategy as another. Thereon Umbro    a number of areas
within the budget of the government that identify ways to improve
biodiversity retention. Rebecca Evans. Thank you, presiding officer.
Marine protected areas Arequipa to war for protecting being diet   
biodiversity and require management. Given that many marine centres are
not in favourable status, what will Welsh Government do to ensure they
are well managed? We intend to contribute towards an ecologically
coherent UK network of well managed green areas, and the Countryside
Council for Wales is currently undertaking a review which is due
to report to the government in the New Year. Dafydd Elis Thomas.
Minister, in what way will the policy of combining the Countryside
Council for Wales, the Environment Agency Wales and the Forestry
Commission, how will that promote biodiversity, considering that
Wales has been very slow on a number of occasions already in
implementing conservation areas? is very important that we look at
the most efficient and effective ways of delivering on the
environment, and of course a single body is a means of doing that and
bringing the expertise that exists in those three organisations into a
single body for the benefit of the environment in Wales. We now move
to questions from party leaders. I called the leader of the opposition
to ask that this Minister three questions. Andrew RT Davies. Thank
you. First Minister, last year the Institute of Directors said that
their members perceived... There was also a comment from the role
Institute of Chartered Surveyors, who said there was an inherent
suspicion around development    developers and entrepreneurs from
the Welsh Government. You are the minister charged with
responsibility for the Welsh Government business scheme. What
are you doing to address those concerns from two leading
professional bodies representing the private sector here in Wales?
These are reflected in the Council for economic renewal that met last
week. We had a wide range of discussion on a number of issues on
that    at back Council and concern was not expressed about Welsh
Government's attitude. There will be announcements in due course that
will show businesses in Wales we want to help them in difficult
times. First Minister, you say they were old concerns, but last week
your business minister lamented the fact that the capitalist system   
of the capitalist system and extolled the values of Marxism. Do
you not think when you have the business and enterprise minister
talking on the floor of the Assembly in such terms that the
points I have what you are reinforced, and it alienates
business interacting with the government. What we hear from the
party opposite, redundancies in the public sector, records youth
unemployment, yet the party opposite does nothing. I can
guarantee the leader of the opposition this government will
help young people find work, unlike his party. First Minister as usual
you have not given one answer this afternoon, not one answer. Your
Business Minister has not made one statement to this plenary on the
cause of this government. It has not highlighted what you will be
doing to assist business other than playing Inter governmental
squabbles. I put two very valid points made by business about the
Welsh Government interacting. I have made a point about what the
minister for business said in the plenary. There is a perception
about them that this government is risk averse and takes no listening
to the business sector in our community. Why were you not respond
to the questions I have put you and ensure your government fully
interacts with business in Wales when people are losing their jobs
up and down this country? He stands there is if his party has no blame
it all to be attached to it for this. Nothing to do with us, the
fact that carbon taxes will cost jobs in Wales, the feed in tariff
will cost jobs in Wales, nothing to do with the party opposite a tall.
We have schemes such as the Welsh jobs fund which will put 4000 young
people into training or apprenticeships every single year.
That will ensure we make up for the neglect we see from the UK
government. The leader of Plaid This is what Ed Miliband said last
night and I will quote him in the language spoken. The government
urgency    her daily needs to get a plan for growth and jobs which will
put young people back to work    urgently needs. And get the economy
moving. Do you agree? Yes. I had suspected you might agree with him,
and it would be difficult for you not agree. You have referred to the
fact that you are introducing a new scheme which will provide 4000
opportunities for young people. The latest figures show an additional
5000 young people are out of work already, even at the current
economic climate, and the likelihood is that there will be
yet more again joining that you tomorrow, which will mean 50,000
young people between 16 24 I took work. These could be the last
generation we saw in the Eighties and Nineties, seeing themselves in
the same situation with no hope of finding work, and in addition to
that scheme of 4000 apprenticeships, what are you going to do? There
will be a statement this week from the minister for enterprise and
business regarding the way forward for assisting businesses in Wales.
There will be a statement next week as regards a capital fund we have
for next year, and, of course, we have ensured that it is easier for
young people in Wales to study in keeping the further education
allowance, and also the Assembly's learning grant. Help which is not
available in England, of course. am very pleased that you appear now
to be responding to this crisis, which is a very real crisis in the
economy. I am sure you will have seen the price Waterhouse Coopers
report published today which makes the point that there are structural
problems and the Welsh economy, and that is why, of course, we have
published the economic renewal programme, because of the
structural problems facing the Welsh economy which are being
worsened because of the economic climate, particularly for young
people. We are seeing that the private sector is too small in
Wales and we must develop and grow that. The problem with that is that
it does demonstrate that Wales has a less attractive place to live
because of the structural problems in the economy, then, as well as
the long term plans. Do you also acknowledge that we need short term
solutions that will help the economy through the current
recession? And if we see that sort of thing, then are you willing to
review the one Wales programmes to see if there are lessons to be
learnt there? Of course we must ensure we are effective as we can
be, and in addition to the statement I have mentioned, ï¿½39
million of funding is available after freezing council tax in
England, which is part, of course, of the plan to move forward, and I
am certain that there will be discussions between the parties as
regards the most effective way forward. Welsh Liberal Democrats.
Kirsty Williams. Do you agree that education does more than shaped the
life chances of individuals or achieve economic success, it is
fundamental to building a just, inclusive and fair society, and if
you do believe that, or why we are not back Welsh Lib Dem proposals to
put    close the funding gap between Welsh and English schools
and find extra money to help our poorest children? We have made a
commitment, of course, to close in the funding gap that exists. It was
one of the pledges we took in the election and has been fulfilled as
a result of the Budget. These are issues, of course, which form part
of the divisions between the two parties. The education
announcements you have made to date will have little appreciable affect
on closing that gap. In Wales, just one in five children on free school
meals, our poorest children, get five good GCSEs grade A * C.
Society pays the price for educational failure. Three quarters
of young offenders describe their academic attainment as Neil and
two thirds of employers say schools do not equipped young people with
the skills they need for work, and one third of those excluded from
school are involved in substance misuse. That is the long term
impact for a short term failure to invest. Does the Labour Party
really disagree but directing extra resources to the poorest children
to give them that extra help they No, but we disagree with moving
money from other areas to pay for that, it is simply money being
moved around. That said, I appreciate the comments and the
force behind them, whilst standing on her feet is not the best way to
negotiate over the next two minutes, I look forward to discussing these
matters at an appropriate time. Have course, the First Minister
fundamentally would misrepresents policy in England, but I'm
interested in Welsh children. Wales cannot afford a politician's short 
term fix to get the budget through this afternoon. Do you not agree
that we need a Statesman's budget that makes the right choice before
education now end in the future? is important that you put country
before party. Nick Clegg sold students down the river. The second
point to be made is that this, of course, there needs to be a budget,
and there needs to be a Budget that is statesmanlike, and there needs
to be proposals coming forward from other parties that are sensible,
and that means the way it has proposed that money should be spent
in a particular way, or more money should be spent in a particular
area, then consideration should be given to read that comes from.
There is no money in reserve, money is moved from other parts of the
Budget, that is what is sensible, and that is what the Welsh people
expect, and we are more than happy to deal with the discussions we
have had. William Graham. Will the First Minister outline the
priorities for the economic development of the South Wales
East? Yes, they are in their new programme for government. Thank you
for your brief answer. Let me join you in congratulating the private
industries such as BAE Systems which has had enormous input with
apprenticeships, and the food company that has increased its
staff by 50, and the ï¿½39 million of private investment that the company
Newport has pioneered in cloud computing. We Dewar agreed that
private industry has made an enormous contribution tooth South
Wales East? Yes, and that has been the case for many years and we want
that to be the case across all of Wales. Will the First Minister
outlined his Government's plans to boost the economy? Our plans are
set out for the programme for government. Thank you. The
Construction Industry needs an injection of confidence, and what
the leaders of the industry had been telling me, they are looking
for a national capital plan, when will the Government announced such
a plan? We're hoping to do that before Christmas, during this
Assembly term. I just got off the phone to a company that has been
providing solar panels to the people on fixed income, people on
low income, for free, because they are able to sell the energy that is
produced by renting the space above the roof of those people. They are
telling me that the impact of this tariff, four months before it was
meant to happen, is absolutely devastating green industries. I
just wonder what impact this is having on the environmental
programme? I think there is a serious threat to jobs as a result
of what was a Brentry decision and I would urge the UK government took
reconsider it. We would do what we can to ensure that this continues
as successfully as it has, and last Friday, the First Minister
announced ï¿½8.8 million to improve the energy efficiency of Welsh
homes and to stimulate the wild green economy. That would seek 550
homes benefiting from energy generating technology through this
scheme and it would make sure jobs are made available to people that
need them. During your trip, Your recent trip to China, you
reaffirmed the arrangement that your predecessors signed there in
2006, given the relatively small size of Wales compared with this
Chinese city that is home to more than 28 million people, and a high
level of competition that Wales faces from other international
cities which competes for influence in China, do you agree that the
Welsh economy would be well served by building additional
relationships with smaller and more innovative cities in China? We give
a commitment to broadening the Welsh government approach and links
it builds between Welsh universities and businesses in
China? A small city in China is rather different to the definition
of what we would call a small city. They all very big. We would like to
engage with some cities in China rather than overstretch ourselves
and spread too thinly. We have established a relationship through
a memorandum of understanding, a relationship with Beijing had we
would like to ensure that we maximise investment opportunities
in Wales. First Minister, a small and medium sized enterprises are
critical to growth in the Welsh economy, but a number of smaller
businesses I have met with recently have identified difficulty in
accessing financial sources that are currently available as a
barrier to growth, and hinder their survival. I visited if the Otley
brewery which is a fantastic example of a Welsh brand with a
capacity to grow and its bottles are in the shop upstairs, but they
had to bottle those products by hand because of the lack of
bottling facilities of their own which requires a small investment.
Given that small and medium size enterprises often lacks Special
Administrative resources to have bureaucratic have been applying for
government support, what we will you help these businesses and to
release money efficiently and quickly? I hope that it was
memorable the two the Otley brewing company! I can say that the
minister will be making an announcement this week that would
be of help in the way bet you described. What steps will the
First Minister take to ensure ministers and their officials were
together on cross country issues for Wales? We work together for all
matters to make sure that officials do so too. You will be aware I
brought this an issue of before because in my constituency
identified a lack of strategic and joined up thinking on some of the
approach has undertaken by government. One of the concerns I
would like to race today is what can you, as First Minister, to me
to bring together people, with regards the new planning
consultation that is coming out, because there will be any planning
Bill which is good for Wales, but I want to make sure the minister for
business, education and skills is also involved in this to ensure
that planning helps businesses to flourish in this country and I
believe that you as First Minister have that ability to bring together
these various departments and I wonder what he would do to halt
that? I am not sure what planning consultation you were referring to,
but if you mean the one that will lead to the publishing of the new
Planning Bill, all ministers will have an interest in ensuring that
this bill is robust, as indeed will local authorities and other bodies
and the public in Wales. As with the previous question, I would like
to ask what proactive steps you as First Minister will be taking to
ensure that the wide range of relevant ministers contribute in a
full and considered wait to be discussions on reforming of the
Common Agricultural Policy? course, around the Cabinet table,
there are a number of items that are discussed and it is an
opportunity for the ministers to express an opinion on things
outside their own portfolio and it makes sure the Government works
together well. What discussions has the First Minister had with the UK
government over the electrification of the main line between South
Wales and London? The UK government is responsible for this funding,
but officials are working with the Department for Transport on a joint
business case that will be completed in December. I wonder if
the First Minister can tell us how the Government intends to promote
the benefits of the electrification of the Great Western line with
businesses in Wales only recently, there was a special First Great
Western servers that I'm sure he knows of and he will agree that it
was great that it broke the previous speed record from Cardiff
to London. It shaped around 20 minutes off the time of travel
between Cardiff and London, so there will be major benefits of
electrification, we were greed is important the Government does all
it can at this point to capitalise on these benefits? Bear in mind,
that train, as far as I know, it did not stop anywhere, which is one
reason why it was rather faster than the normal service! But to
take the point on electrification, it sends a message to investors
that Wales, South Wales, is easy to reach. Investment has been made in
the transport infrastructure and as a result, connectivity between
Cardiff and London, on this occasion, is actually faster than
many would realise. It is important that we seek a letter vocation as
far as Swansea in the meantime. was on the train that no grants you
referred to and I notice that we did not stop in any stations on the
way. But it has to be said that having considered that, it was a
particularly smooth journey and you could see there would be advantages
in operating the railway line.    up grading. We need to everything
in your ability to ensure that the upgrade, including the
electrification, does go as far as Swansea. It would be wonderful if
it could go further, but if it at least goes as far as Swansea.
very important, for two reasons. It gives a message that if it were to
stop in Cardiff, it gives the message that the main line stops in
Cardiff, and that would not assist Wales in any way. We know that
future investment on trains will be in the electric trains. It is very
important that we in Wales can benefit from an electrified line in
the future. For the very reasons you have just set out, you will
know that Swansea council, local MPs and other bodies are trying to
put together an alternative business case to take
electrification to Swansea. Can you outline what the Government's
involvement is with that process and how much support rigging to it?
We are working with the Department of Transport on a joint business
case to see it completed next month. Will the First Minister make a
statement on improving health and equality in Wales? Yes, good health
and well being should not depend on where people live for their social
circumstances and the importance of reducing health inequalities is
highlighted in our fight your vision for the NHS in Wales
together for health.    are a five  year revision. I was very pleased
to attend the National child poverty Conference and young
people's summit recently were children gave first and accounts of
the inequalities they are experiencing because of the poverty
of their parents, and there were discussions about poor diet,
smoking, stress, for example. I know that the programme for
government has set up a range of measures to tackle all of this, but
can you tell us what the white government is doing to address the
needs of children that are suffering in particular?    what
the wise government is doing? strategy is to reduce the
inequalities that can't see exist in help.    that currently exist.
Actions are being delivered to improve the health outcomes of
children and young people and families living in poverty. First
Minister, I am deeply concerned about the health and inequality
that exists in South Wales East. Statistics suggest that smoking and
obesity rates above the Wiesner but average.    the reasonable average.
People have health problems that are higher than the Welsh average.
How will the administration insurer there is a renewed focus on
preventive health measures, to reverse these troubling trends,
particularly in areas of Wales that suffer most from poor public
health? You mentioned smoking, we talked about a tobacco control
action plan that discourages young people from starting to smoke and
to support people that want to give up, and it has a strong focus on
protecting children and reducing inequality in health. Thank you.
The health trust in the Nice area at consulted on creating a new
health centre and the plan was to close the surgery and create a new
centre and retain the resolve and surgery. The intention is now to
close both surgeries with the expectation that people will travel.
How we USS as a government in ensuring that these people that
have to travel on public transport will not suffer health inequalities
as a result as any plan of this sort, and would maintaining a
second surgery be something the Government would support?    how
would you resolve as a government? It is difficult to know that answer
without considering the concision of both surgeries because it is we
need to make sure that local health boards consider how easy it is to
travel from one place to another. When they considered decisions they
We know there are stark statistics on health inequality not only
within the City of Cardiff but across the country, Bute Town
compared to parts of Ceredigion, there is a distance of over   
difference up over a decade in her life expectancy. Can the government
co ordinate action between agencies including local health boards and
local government to direct and improve the health in terms of our
poorest and most vulnerable communities. Our Health
unsustainable pre schools scheme is being rolled out in pre school
settings    and sustainable pre  school scheme. By extending flying
start, that is an effective way of reducing inequality in terms of
health in different areas. What are the Welsh Government's priorities
for animal health? Well, the priorities include the eradication
of bovine TB    TB and taking steps to control other animal diseases,
and ensuring contingency measures can be acted on quickly in the
event of disease outbreak. Thank you for that response, but I am
sure you as I am disappointed that your government has failed to keep
its word in terms of making a clear announcement on the badger cull
plan in the autumn, as was promised. Now the plan will has established
and concluded its work    panel, or will you ensure it makes an early
statement so York ministers can explain the rationale behind the
decision, be it in favour or against a badger cull, directly
with the agricultural community in the winter fare at Builth Wells
later in the month? This statement will be issued as soon as possible.
The minister is considering the conclusions of the report that will
be given to him by the chief scientific consultant. First
Minister, I have some real concerns about powers transferred to local
authorities to protect animal welfare. I note that currently
there has been a drop in many of the convictions from 204 in 2009 to
147 in 2010. Of the 147, some 114 were for causing unnecessary
suffering, and 20 it for not meeting the welfare requirements of
animals have in their care    28. First Minister, what are you doing
to ensure there has been sufficient levels of funding cent the cross
from this Welsh Government to ensure local authorities are able
to carry out their duties diligently so as to avoid any
animals have been Wales and necessarily suffering? Of course,
the funding is for local authorities to explain the level of
funding they give to animal welfare issues. I know the RSPCA has
recently been very supportive in terms of praising animal welfare in
Wales and all the steps done in order to improve it. Question nine,
Ken Skates. Will the First Minister outline what the Welsh Government
is doing to support social enterprises in Wales. We have a
number of ways of supporting social enterprises including specialist
business support and a representative voice within the
Welsh social enterprise coalition. Over the past two years, interest
in social investment bonds has been growing. The central idea is that
an authority such as the Assembly or local government sells bonds,
and the money funds schemes such as those in new services. The bond
issuer repays the bond. The small scheme is already operating in
Peterborough prison at a in    aimed at cutting reoffending. Will
be Welsh Government were cut the role of innovative funding
solutions like these that they could have been helping provide
additional services such as extra support for care leavers? Yes, we
are always interested in looking at solutions to issue such as
reoffending. Graham aware of the project currently being undertaken
in Peterborough prison, and we will continue to monitor those
activities to see what the outcome of that pilot project is. Mark
Fisher would. As with private enterprise, social enterprise in
Wales is also concerned that they could lose out on procurement
exercises when the public sector is procuring service delivery. What
action is your government taking, or do you propose to take in
practice, to ensure there is support for social enterprises in
Wales, including for business, which takes into account community
causes which too often are not given sufficient consideration by
public sector procurers? The issue of procurement was right    was
raised at the council and there was a long discussion for part of the
Council on that very topic. As a result of those discussions, we
will be moving forward with plans to make procurement clearer, and to
help smaller businesses bid for contracts in the future. Leanne
Wood. Not a month seems to go by without some study or other
publishing information illustrating how low life expectancy in certain
areas in Wales compared to the rest of the UK. Given that diet is one
of the main contributing factors to low life expectancy, can you say
how you would be prepared to support any community based
companies set up    setting up new systems of producing and
distributing food to people who are currently struggling to afford
food? We look, of course, to help through schemes such as the Social
Enterprise Support Project, and the funding we provide to the Wales co 
operative Centre, the redevelopment Trust Association and social firms
Wales, and I know a major conference on social enterprise
will be held in Swansea this week, in fact, during global
entrepreneurship week. I urge any organisations that want to move
forward in the area we describe to get involved and access the funding
that they be available. Question  time, Sandy Mewies. First Minister,
will you make a statement on the support the Welsh Government is
giving to young people in further education in Wales? We will
continue to support young people entering into and returning to
further education, and we have retained important support schemes
including the education maintenance allowance and the Assembly learning
grant. Financial contingency funds are also available for those in
financial difficulties whilst at college. Thank you, First Minister.
Everyone here is where the relief are students felt when the Welsh
Government took the decision to preserve the education maintenance
allowance, unlike the despair felt by students across the border at
the decision taken by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats
in Westminster. A survey has shown that almost half of England's
further education authorities have seen a decline in student numbers
due to the scrapping of the EMA, and of course, these are the poorer
students. Would you agree with me, First Minister, that are decisions
demonstrate that unlike the UK Tory coalition government, Welsh
Government is investing in young people and not sitting by
completion Lee as restore education are closed and tens of thousands of
young people find themselves out of work because of the coalition's
policy?    sitting by complacently. Yes, the difference but in
ourselves when it comes to student support and the attitude of the UK
government is that we support students than they don't. Angela
Burns. Sandy Mewies mentioned the thousands of young people in Wales
who do not have a job, and Minister, I was wondering what do you have in
your remit to ensure that for example are nine sectors identified
actually reflect with the minister for education in terms of ensuring
students going for further education actually are studying
courses that will enable them to really go into business, for
businesses we need here for our economy in Wales? That is done, of
course, we want to ensure training opportunities are available in the
key sectors we identified. There have been numerous discussions
between a number of ministers to ensure the need for qualifications
in these key sectors is reflected in the provision of education in
Wales. Simon Thomas. Of course, Plaid Cymru support the
government's current policies, but with investment of ï¿½3.6 billion
over this Assembly period going into supporting students, I am sure
you would agree that we must ensure value for money, so what steps were
you as a government take to ensure current policies and plans do not
decrease access to students from deprived backgrounds? Of course, we
will be monitoring the situation, but we know there are so many
students in a position where they wouldn't be able to go to college
if they didn't receive significant levels of financial support, and we
want to ensure that happens in Wales where it doesn't happen in
England. The proposed budget includes a cut in the expenditure
on transport within learning pathways 14 19. Will those cuts be
implemented fairly or equally across the whole of Wales?
course, we want to ensure that it is still possible for students to
travel from one course to another, but in terms of funding, that is
something that is currently, as I understand, going through so local
authorities can take their own That is where we leave First
Minister's questions. You can see more coverage on wine.    online.
Our Welsh Affairs Editor Vaughan Roderick is with us. Born, I
mentioned at the top of the programme of the Budget dominating.
   born. Did we see attempts at budget negotiations from Kirsty
Williams there? Yes, and I think in a more subtle way from the leader
of Plaid Cymru. I didn't understand Kirsty Williams's tactics. Parties
are in negotiation, so why try to bring it out into the open by
saying, will you agree? She was never going to get an answer.
and also she may have made things harder for herself, because one of
the appeals, it seemed to me, of doing a deal with the Lib Dems for
Carwyn Jones is that he could do it possibly without moving money
education budget. Kevin Jones, in his response, had to say he didn't
think that was a good idea, which makes it harder. I thought it was a
much less icy atmosphere between him and the Plaid Cymru leader
today, so I think the possibility of a deal there is opening up as
well. We know there is a debate in the Senate macro later and the boat,
but it is a side issue really, but    because it will be on going
until 6th December. It is a ritual, and it doesn't matter if the
government loses today. What is likely to happen today is that both
the opposition amendment and the government motion will fail, but
today is a crucial vote. But what this does show is that the
opposition are in talks with each other. The government shouldn't
think it just has three sets of bilateral talks going on. There are
talks between the opposition parties as well which will
underline to the government that it will not be easy to reach a deal.
In terms of the numbers, we know Labour have 30, there are 30
members of the opposition. Darren Millar of the Conservatives has
been away from the Senate macro in South Africa, and injured his leg
on a visit related to his job and has been wheeled into the chamber
important for the opposition today at least to match the government's
boat. It would be a bad day for them if someone pressed the wrong
button or failed to be here, or whatever. So it is a test of
strength, but a test that doesn't actually do anything apart from
ratchet up the tension on the government. Vaughan Roderick, thank
you. We will keep you updated across all our services here on BBC
