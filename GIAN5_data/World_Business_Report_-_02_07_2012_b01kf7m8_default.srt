it is away.    Sally. Welcome to World Business
Report. London's interest rate fixing scandal claims its first
international lenders. There are speculations it will ask for
another two years to fulfil the conditions of its bailout.
In just over one of our's time, the banking giant Barclays will
announce the resignation of its chairman. The BBC understands he
made the decision to go on Saturday night, citing the devastating blow
to the bank's reputation from the revelations it had tried to fix
interest rates. The rate fixing scandal has sent
shock waves through the industry. It has now claimed its first high 
profile victim. The chairman of Barclays is resigning. The fixing
of interbank lending rate has already cost the bank ï¿½290 million
in fines. Until now, those are    those who are at the top of the
bank had refused to quit. This really goes to the heart of the
British economy and the heart of the city of London. I hope the
authorities, shareholders and regulators really react
aggressively and fast in the next few days. Barclays is one of more
than 20 banks currently under investigation. Rival RBS sacked
four of its traders at the start of the Year, a move designed to prove
that it was, and is, in control of the crisis. On Sunday, the head of
the city watchdog made a comment. Further steps were made to enable
us to bring criminal charges, but they did not cover the libel market.

these powers considerably on top of what we have at the moment.
(CHANTING). After a resurgence of shareholder activism   like these
protests against Barclays' pay deals, Vince Cable says it is
shareholders, not the government or regulators who should hold
management boards to account. Before answering to shareholders,
Barclays' boss Bob Diamond will have to answer to MPs at the
Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday. With growing public
anger, there will also be questions about whether he, too, should now
step down. For another view, let's speak to
the editor of the Banker magazine. Do you think this is enough? The
chairman going? I don't think it will be. This libel fixing scandal
is in a league of its own. It is different to those of insider
trading at banks. This affects the whole of the market. It will affect
London's reputation as a financial centre. All but Lee, who runs
Barclays is up to the shareholders.    ultimately. He will have to go
before a Treasury Select Committee this week and ask some questions
about what has gone on at the bank. No doubt they will focus on the
fact that US authorities say that management and new, and in fact,
instructed, workers at Barclays to go ahead with these actions. Yes,
some very damaging things came out of the report from the US
regulators where they said the senior bank management instructed
the traders and these have knitters to carry out this practice.    and
these have    the submitters. regulation to light in the UK?
don't think that London is worse than other places, but regulations
might need to change. There are regulations out there which might
restrict London more than other markets, but they have not kick in

Can Greece clear on to membership of the euro? The country's new
government may ask for two more years to meet their targets when
the troika returned to Athens today. On Sunday, senior ECB officials
told German television that Greece must stick to its austerity
programme 100% if it wants to stay in the euro. That is looking less
achievable by the day. But troika were not too impressed
last time they came to Greece. Since then, deepening depression
and the distractions of an electoral campaign have further
slowed process, making it even more unlikely that Athens can ever
fulfil its financial promises. The Conservatives, socialists and
moderate leftists would like to bargain for a two year extension,
along with more rescue cash. Brussels insists that the elections
changed nothing, though the IMF admits it is open to discussions
about how Greece can best meet its objectives. The troika will assess
conflicting evidence of process with reforms. One report says that
civil servant numbers will have been cut by 100,000 by the end of
the Year. Another suggest 70,000 have been recruited in two years.
When it comes to the promised privatisations of state utilities,
sell off programmes are ready, according to this economist, but
politicians would not push the start button before the elections.
They claim that they were ready to proceed with privatisation, however,
these elections have been a big obstacle. Namely, political parties
have refrained from taking the necessary decisions to proceed with
privatisation, thinking that if they win elections, if one party or
the other party wins, then this will mean that they will have a
free hand to decide how to progress. Meanwhile, the troika can only
focus on achievements to date. These reports will provide evidence
as Athens appeal to their EU partners to respond to sacrifice
Europe's debt crisis is Wayne on other parts of the world. June saw
the weakest growth in China's manufacturing for around seven
months. In Japan, sentiment measures came out better than
expected. This survey showed that Japan is,
perhaps, or remaining resilient? That's right. Both manufacturers
and other businesses seem less pessimistic in the three months up
to June. The big manufacturers are coming in at minus one, which is an
improvement compared to the previous quarter. The country's
economy has been recovering quite strongly after the earthquake, but
we have to remember that there have been quite a number of special
measures that the Government has implemented as well as the Bank of
Japan, in order to boost the economy. This survey is a rather
backward looking data collection. If you look at the recent
manufacturing data, from, as you say, both China and Japan and
been starting to affect the manufacturing activities hear it in
Asia as well.    here in Asia.
Apple will pay a Chinese company $60 million to settle their long 
running legal dispute over the iPad name and its use in China. Apple
said it brought the global rights to the name in 2009, but Chinese
authorities say that the ownership was never transferred. The
settlement will lead to possible complications in selling the device
in China   one of Apple's most important markets.
