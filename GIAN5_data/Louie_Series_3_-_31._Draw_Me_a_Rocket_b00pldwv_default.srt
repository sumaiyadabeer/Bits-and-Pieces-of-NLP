Louie! Yoo hoo! Louie!
I will teach you how
To make a picture now
Drawing can be fun Let me show you how it's done
Draw us a picture, Louie
When I colour in
The magic will begin
And together we'll make the picture come real
Draw us a picture, Louie
Take a look and see
How easy it can be
Come along and draw with me
So draw us a picture
Draw us a picture, Louie.
Hello there, Friends.
Hello, Louie! Hello, Yoko!
Watch carefully.
Whee! Whee!
Louie, did you see how light I am?
Ooh!
I know how to jump with those feet, too!
Oh, no!
  That's because, Louie,
You are too heavy to jump over the puddles.
Too heavy?
Oh, but wait, Yoko! I know a place where I'll be less heavy.
A place where you'll be less heavy?
Where's that?
Up there!
Now, Friends, what do you see up there?
The moon!
But, Louie, you want to go to the moon?
But why?
You'll see. On the moon you can do all sorts of extraordinary things.
But it's too far.
Yes, but I know how to get there!
Wait for me, back soon!
Go to the moon? Come on!
I sometimes wonder if Louie isn't just...
Being silly!
Yoko?
You're going to help me draw a rocket.
  A big one!
  A rocket?
But I don't know how to draw a rocket, Louie.
But it's very easy. You'll see.
First you draw a line like this.
And two little lines like this.
Cool!
It's missing something to fly with.
Something that you have, Yoko.
Er...
Hmm...
Oh, yeah! My antennae.
No! Some wings, see.
We have to draw a crescent shape on each side,
to make a wing.
  And a second wing!
  And now we'll...
Climb on board!
Not yet, Yoko. We have to draw the cabin like an egg.
And now all we have left to do is...
Um, climb on board?
Colour in the rocket!
Do you want to do that, Yoko?
Yeah, I'm going to colour it in red.
Ha ha!
There, you see, isn't our rocket pretty?
Yes, very pretty!
So, then, Yoko, what are you waiting for?
  Um, I don't know.
  Climb on board!
Yippee, blast off!
Hey!
Ground control   you do the countdown, OK?
Three, two, one...
Blast off!
Whoo hoo!
Oh, what's happening?
My wings don't work any more!
That's normal, Yoko.
On the moon, there's no air. That is why you cannot fly.
On the other hand, Yoko... you can jump!
Wow!
Jump very, very high.
Can I do that as well, Louie?
Of course! Go on, don't be scared.
Go on, Yoko! Go on!
Whoo hoo!
Wa ah! Whoo oooh!
Louie, did you see all the somersaults that I did?
Yes! Look at this one, watch. A backwards flip!
Whoa oo ooh!
I'm coming!
Whee ee!
We are true acrobats.
Oh, Louie, there's another moon in the sky   a blue one!
That's Earth.
From far away, it looks blue because there's lots of water on Earth.
Oh, I understand!
Er, Louie, how do we get home?
To draw a rocket, you draw a vertical line.
And at the bottom, you leave a little gap for the engine.
You add a wing on each side...
In the shape of a crescent.
And afterwards, you draw the cabin.
To finish, you can colour it in, in any colours you like.
And then, your lovely rocket is ready to travel into space.
We'll see you back on Earth, Friends!
See you soon, Louie! See you soon, Yoko!
Louie! Louie!
Whee!
Wow!
Louie, draw me a picture.
