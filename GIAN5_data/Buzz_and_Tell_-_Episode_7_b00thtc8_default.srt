Yes, it's Buzz And Tell, the wackiest and whisperiest quiz on TV!
And here's your host, Walter Flipstick.
Hello, and welcome to Buzz And Tell,
the quiz show that makes you stop and think.
Let's meet our panel of thinkers.
My name is Melanie Wiggles and I think about my carrots.
My name is Karl and I think about nuts, I think.
I'm Henrietta Peck and I think about my chicks.
I'm Charles Cheese and I think about cheese.
I'm Mr Biscuits and I think about biscuits.
I think it's time to start!
Fingers on buzzers, this is our missing word round.
Buzz and tell me what word is missing from this phrase.
"It's a lovely day because the SOMETHING is shining."
What is shining?
  Charles Cheese!
Mr Biscuits' nose is shining.
No.
Me, me, me, Mr Walter! I know.
  Use your buzzer, Karl.
  Oh, yes, yes.
  Karl.
I'm... I'm... I'm not sure what I was going to say.
Listen again, "It's a lovely day because SOMETHING is shining."
What is that missing something?
  Mr Biscuits!
The sun.
It's a lovely day because THE SUN is shining.
That is correct, Mr Biscuits, one point to you.
Oh, yes, I'm very happy when my nose is shining, it's so big and red.
And now for our next round.
You'll see a picture of something and you have to buzz and tell me
what it is. What is it?
  Mr Biscuits.
  It's a space shuttle launcher.
  No.
  Charles Cheese.
  It's a whispering platform.
  What?
A whispering platform for mice to run up and whisper into grown ups' ears.
What would a mouse whisper into a grown up's ear?
Have you got any cheese?
Could you please sell the cat!
Have another look, what is this?
  Henrietta Peck.
Something f o o o or... POP!
  It's a slide.
It is indeed a slide.
One point to you, Henrietta and chick.
And now onto our numbers round. How many legs does a spider have?
  Mr Biscuits.
  Oh, spiders are funny.
  Yes, they are, but how many legs do they have?
  Me, me, Mr Walter. I know this.
  Karl, your buzzer, please.
  Would you like it? Is yours broken?
  No, you have to press yours.
Oh, yes. BUZZ!
  All right, Karl, what do you know?
  Er, what was the question?
  How many legs does a spider have?
  Five! Nine! Three!
  No.
  Melanie Wiggles.
  They have eight legs.
Eight legs, Melanie! Spiders have eight legs.
That's correct, one point to Melanie Wiggles.
Now it's time for our sound round.
Listen to this sound and buzz and tell me what it is.
Me, me, me! I know, Mr Walter, I know this!
Buzz, Karl! Buzz!
Yes, I know! Buzz, buzz. It's a fly.
Yes, you're right.
Ha ha! One point to Karl.
And now onto our final round, general knowledge.
Fingers on buzzers. What comes next?
