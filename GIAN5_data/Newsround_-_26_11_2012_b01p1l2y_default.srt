It's Monday 26th November. I'm Leah. And I'm Hayley, and we've got a
packed show for you this afternoon live from Newsround HQ in Salford.
Coming up. Wet and getting wetter. We'll
update you on the floods as the rain heads north. And I meant
levels are continuing to rise. You tell us who you think should be
Sports Personality of the year. And McWho? We give the boys a
memory test. This is Newsround. But first, to the bad weather that
just keeps on battering Britain. It's moving north, to the north
east of England and North Wales. Parts of the country are braced for
even more flooding as heavy rain continues to fall on ground that's
already soaked through. In the south west, many roads are
still blocked. Emergency services have been working non stop to
rescue people who'd got trapped. One family in Wiltshire said there
was nothing they could do to stop the water pouring into their house.
All we could do is stand and watch. And just mark the position of the
it did came in it came through the floor. And while some people are
mopping up in their homes, for others, the threat of floods has
not yet passed. The Environment Agency is the part of the
government that deals with flooding. They've put in place nearly 200
flood warnings, where a flood is definitely expected, telling people
to take action. And nearly 300 flood alerts, telling people to
prepare, just in case. Ricky's been in Burton upon Trent
in Staffordshire, which has a flood warning in place, to see how people
are trying to protect themselves from the threat of rising water.
People here are on alert and are expecting heavy rain tonight. The
kind of whether it that can cause serious damage. A flood alert has
been issued in Burton upon Trent and a more serious flood warning
has been issued along the side of the River Trent, one of the major
rivers in England. That means river levels have been increasing and are
showing no signs of slowing down. Thousands of people here must
prepare themselves for the possibility of a flat. Water from
the River Trent has spilled onto the pavement and that is why the
Environment Agency have put flood defences in place. These are metal
fences which. The water from travelling any further. In the
distance you can see some park benches submerged in water. Been
prepared is essential. Today I watch a team of specialists put in
a barriers to make sure the water is contained. Instruments are
located on all rivers around the country and are measuring water
levels all the time. They set off alarms when they get to a level
which is starting to cause a problem. We always see people
putting the sandbags outside their homes. Where can people get these?
You can get them in the shops or perhaps from the local council. But
if not you can just fill up a shopping bag with soil from the
garden. Emergency services are urging people to be careful and not
risk their lives and to only travel if necessary. All the people here
can do is wait for the rain to pass and hope it does not cause too much
damage. Well, if heavy rain is coming your
way, it's best to be prepared so that you can help protect
yourselves, your pets and your homes. So head over to the
Newsround website for our top five tips on keeping safe in the floods.
Don't miss it! Leah, what was your sporting
highlight of 2012? Wiggo becoming the first British winner of the
Tour de France? That was pretty cool. How about Murray's first
major tennis title, and all those Olympic and Paralympic golds. Those
too. There's no doubting it has been an incredible year of sport.
And tonight the nominations for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year
award will be announced. I've been finding out who you guys think
should be in with a shout of winning.
Every year it won a sexual athlete is crowned BBC Sports personality
of the year.    a special athlete. It is going to be a tough choice.
Among the 12 contenders are three strong favourites. We have the
golden girl, Jessica Ennis. Long distance runner Mo Farah and of
course Bradley Wiggins. Who do you think should wind Sports
personality of the year? I think Jessica Ennis because she's really
fast. I think Mo Farah because he's good fun and the fastest runner in
Britain. Who do you think should win? I think it should the Andy
Murray because he has been going for years. I think the Paralympic
athletes should get the chance because they worked so well this
year. Do you remember last year, we had no women voted in a shortlist
for the award. Do you think it will be different this year? I do. They
have been amazing. Nicola Adams has done well in boxing. She got
mentioned a lot. These guys all over the want to win but we will
find out for sure who will make the shortlist tonight at 7 o'clock. We
will find out the names of the 12 finalists at 7 o'clock. All day on
the website we have been asking you to get in touch with who you think
should definitely make the shortlist. We had a lot of comments.
Emma in Greater Manchester says, "Wiggo definitely, he is so
inspiring and everyone loves his side burns! Wiggins all the way!"
But Will, all the way from Malaysia, says, "It's got to be Mo Farah, I
mean how awesome is he? He's just too cool, imagine GB without him  
pretty glum!" Let's talk showbiz now. So, one of them won Strictly,
another won I'm a Celebrity and now McFly have a new album out! Yes,
it's a busy time for the boys. And to make matters worse, we hit them
with a Newsround memory test! Serves them right for calling their
album Memory Lane. In December to 1006 what did Duddy
right on the camera? Bogey. You are a very naughty boy. You're song
star role was played in an unusual place. In space. If you were an
the programme when they announced that.
Prince Harry and Peter Andre were voted as best celebrity what?
haircut. Thank you very much. You have been
