Has an original point of view
  And I say, hey!
  Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day We can learn to work and play
And get along with each other
You gotta listen to your heart Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm of the street Open your eyes! Open your ears
Get together, make things better By working together
It's a simple message And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself For that's the place to start
  And I say, hey!
  Hey!
  What a wonderful kind of day
  We can learn to work and play And get along with each other.
  Hey!
  What a wonderful kind of day.
  Hey!
  What a wonderful kind of day.
Hey, DW!
  Hey!
  Whoa!
  Yuck!
  Sometimes, it seems like the world can be split into two parts  
things that adults like and things kids like. Take movies...
  And when they threw coins into the fountain...
  Just heartbreaking!
Nothing happened! It was about two people who never meet!
Oh, that's why it's so wonderful!
Then there's art.
  I don't know a kid who...
  Isn't it fabulous?
Have you seen a more beautiful...
"Depiction of the dia lectic between form and formlessness?"
  You can't honestly tell me that you like this?
  Erm, well...
No. Not really. But I wanna like it. Daddy owns six by this artist.
I'll take this too. Won't that look great opposite your bed, Muffin?
Oh, yeah! Great!
Ah! Are these tickets to the Tween Dream concert?
Daddy, you shouldn't have!
I didn't. They're tickets to something I hope you'll like as much,
the Opera.
  Oh.
  It's the opening night of Bizet's Carmen,
one of my all time favourites.
  Such passionate music.
  Oh, Rodney!
Gilfry is playing Escamillo. Oh, it kills me not to go!
But I have the charity auction that night.
AND we have orchestra seats!
  What do ya say, Muffin? Wanna be my date?
  But I'm going to need something to wear!
  Sky's the limit, Pumpkin!
  How about this?
  It's the OPERA we're talking about,
  not a rodeo!
  You know what the opera is?
People in silly costumes singing in another language!
Maybe it's too sophisticated for you to appreciate, Prunella!
Yeah? Well, I've actually been to an opera, Your Highness (!)
It was 4Â½ hours long.
I fell asleep in act one, woke up in act three,
and there was a whole act to go!
  You probably won't make it through the overture.
  Well?
You look like a rice pudding!
Come in, Miss Muffy.
  Bailey, do you know anything about opera?
  Indeed, Miss Muffy.
I thought it'd be good to hear some before Friday.
Certainly.
Stop! Please, stop!
  Hmm?
  I might have to listen to four hours of that?
That depends on the opera.
I was singing an excerpt from Wagner's Ring Cycle,
which has a running time of approximately 16 hours.
Ah!
Only two more days till the opera.
Bet you're excited!
Can I pick 'em, or what?
Only two more days!
Ah!
Bravo! Bravo! Bra...
And even if I do stay awake,
what do I say when Daddy asks me if I liked it?
  Just tell him you don't wanna go.
  He'd be so disappointed!
  He was really excited about us going.
  Do you know what it's about?
No. It's called Carmen.
Maybe it's about auto mechanics!
Carmen, hah? That's a great opera.
It's a tragic tale of passion, betrayal and revenge.
  Like professional wrestling, to great music!
  You know it?
Sure. I have highlights from it on a CD.
You can come and listen to it after school.
The plot is pretty simple.
Don Jose, a soldier, falls in love with a Gypsy named Carmen.
He leaves his girl, the army and becomes a bandit to be with her!
But Carmen falls in love with this bullfighter!
Don Jose is crushed.
  He ruins his whole life for this woman, who dumps him!
  Ah!
So he...
I don't wanna spoil it for you.
But let's just say, it doesn't end well.
Hey, where is your friend
The beautiful Muffy. THERE!
There she is The beautiful Muffy
Muffy, you are pretty and charming and cool
Muffy, tell us what you want us to do
Allow us to take you to an opera
Oh, please come with us
To the opera.
I am like a rebellious bird No one can put me in a cage
Opera is long, with plots absurd
I like bands that are all the rage
Even if you promise me jewels You wouldn't find me near that stage
Opera is good for tired old fools Or soldiers who make minimum wage
  She is like a rebellious bird
  Boy bands
  No one can put her in a cage
  Boy bands
Opera is long, with plots absurd
We like bands that are all the rage
Boy bands are what I like to hear
Ones with many different kinds of hairdos
If you like those Then I'll be there
If not, that's it Goodbye, you lose
  Goodbye, you lose
  If you like those
If you like those Then I'll be there
  Goodbye, you lose
  But if you don't
If you don't...
Goodbye, you lose
Where are you taking me?
To the opera These tickets weren't cheap
But I told you That's not my scene
Too bad
  Tween Dream was sold out
  Ah...
So you adore that teenybopper trash
Don't you get bored? There's more to explore
Open your heart to different kinds of song
Who knows, you could be wrong...
Opera is not a chore It's so much more
So much more to...adore.
  Where are you going?
  After him.
  You'll go with him, but not me?
  That's right, step aside!
  That's it? After all that I've done?
  My allowance, down the drain?
  Get off!
  I'll never go with you
  I'd rather you sleep through it
  Than go with him...
  I won't...
Even with your magic powder I'll stay awake
I'll stay awake...
  Oh!
  Ah, Muffy...
My te rrible...
..pupil.
Muffy. Hey, wake up!
That was beautiful!
Play some more.
  What are you talking about? You were asleep.
  I was?
Through it all. I didn't realise until you started snoring.
  You sound like a lawn mower!
  Ah!
Prunella was right, I probably won't make it through the overture!
Shall I restart it?
Let's face it, opera just isn't for me.
Oh, Muffy, it's divine!
All we have to do is take up the hem.
  I think we should take it back. I don't wanna go.
  Why not?
Because I won't like it. Couldn't you go instead?
I'll do the charity auction. I'd be really good at that!
  I didn't think I'd like opera when your father took me.
  You didn't?
He practically had to drag me.
  Now it's one of my favourite things, even better than shopping!
  Really?
But you were already a grown up. It's different!
Maybe. But you'll never know unless you try.
Here. I have the perfect accessory for you...
Opera glasses! It's more exciting if you see the singers' expressions.
I will not fall asleep! I will not fall asleep!
Oh! It's so beautiful!
Bravo! Hurrah! Bravo!
Friday? No. I can't go to the movies then,
Daddy got us tickets to the Opera. Tosca's playing!
I thought you hated opera.
I guess you could say I've had a change of heart! Gotta go.
Perfect!
Ah!
  And I say hey.
  Hey
  What a wonderful kind of day
If we can learn to work and play
  And get along with each other.
  Hey
  What a wonderful kind of day.
  Hey
  What a wonderful kind of day.
  Hey!
