the world championships in Korea Hello, good afternoon. Welcome to
the BBC News at One. The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick
Clegg, has condemned the violence and disorder in London last night
and said it was unrelated to the death of Mark Duggan, the man shot
Brixton and parts of the West End, following riots in Tottenham on
Saturday night. Police called the disorder copycat criminal activity.
The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has cut short her holiday to return
to the UK. Our home affairs correspondent is in top numb with
more for us. Yes, Tottenham High Road is a sorry
sight today. Buildings are gutted, many of the shops closed and much
of the street behind police cordons. Papal are picking through the
police right kitsch    if people are picking through the wreckage.
For 80 years, this building housing a carpet shop and flats has been a
Tottenham landmark. By the end of today, it is expected to be rubble.
Just one casualty of the violence which swept through here on
Saturday night leaving many residents angry. I'm shocked at
what happened over the weekend. Still shocked and seeing this
building today has really hit home for me. Even as they were counting
the cost in Tottenham yesterday, some four miles north in Enfield,
there were more running battles with the police. Apparently, a
copycat incident. This time, the police response was swift and
decisive. The violence failed to escalate. The writing in Tottenham
came from a peaceful protest against the shooting of Mark Duggan.
But elsewhere the violence was condemned as opportunistic.
violence we saw last night had absolutely nothing to do with the
death of Mr Duggan. It was needless, opportunistic theft and violence,
nothing more, nothing less and it is completely unacceptable. As well
as Enfield, there was trouble in Edmonton. There was violence and
looting in Walthamstow and in south London, Brixton was affected as
well. The trouble there was concentrated around the high street
and a nearby retail park way youths broke into shops. Across London,
more than 100 arrests were made. are talking about opportunists. I
was in the control room last night and I watched the spontaneous
groups of youths picking shops they wanted to look, perhaps they had
the most desirable merchandise or being opportunist around particular
areas of London. There is no co  ordinated action here, no Mr Big or
any sense of protest about this. It is criminality pure and simple and
we should treat it like that. the police are dressed criticism
that not enough had been done to help the bereaved family of Mark
Duggan whose death last week is being investigated by the
Independent Police Complaints Commission. I have spoken to
community representatives. Are we have had meetings at a local level
and a London level. We should have helped the IPC come closer to the
family more quickly. Even this morning, the firefighters were
still dousing the smouldering ruins of Tottenham's night of violence.
The anger that fuelled it is dampening as well but there is
anger at those who did the damage. Later today, we expect workers to
begin the process of tearing down this building before they can begin
the process of rebuilding the street. Then there is the process
of rebuilding trust between not just the police and the community
but within the community as well. Thank you. Our correspondent Luisa
Baldini is at Scotland Yard for us. There has been a police briefing in
the last half an hour. What has been said? The briefing is still
ongoing. It is being held by the assistant deputy commissioner but
the acting commissioner, Tim Godwin, a actually stepped into the
briefing at the beginning because he wanted to speak to us personally.
He was not there for long because he is an extremely busy man today.
He has to make the Home Secretary later this afternoon. He said he
wanted to praise the bravery, determination and resilience that
he said could clearly be seen by his officers. He said, we need to
separate grievance and criminality. He recognises that there are some
community grievances but what he said was the violence was the
result of opportunistic criminality. He said they do need to listen to
the community. He said the police need to look at the events leading
up to this outbreak of violence. But he said a lot of hard work has
been done over the last couple of decades to improve relations
between    with communities like Tottenham. He said over 600 safer
neighbourhood teams, for example. He said we are at a difficult. But
we do not want to rubbish the effort which has been made over the
last couple of decades. The Assistant Deputy Commissioner Steve
Kavanagh it took over from him. He told us more about what his police
officers experienced. He said that in some of the stores that were
looted, people were stealing knives and machetes and those were being
used to attack his officers. Thank you.
The financial markets have been unsettled this morning, despite the
European Central Bank's decision to buy up more government debt. The
FTSE is down 1.7 % after initially opening higher. That comes after a
10 % slump last week. Investors are bracing themselves when Wall Street
opens after the decision to strip the USA of its triple A credit
stating on Friday. The financial markets never sleep.
Australian traders were among the first to give their reaction to the
weekend's developments with shares falling sharply. The Japanese
market also registered the steep drop in share prices as concern
over the European debt crisis persisted. In London, shares rose
first thing with a feeling that policy makers were starting to get
a grip. The move in London was calmer when trading opened this
morning than it was at the end of last week. Markets had been gripped
by fears that Italian and Spanish public sector debt was out of
control and there was no obvious solution. Late last night, the
European Central Bank indicated that it would move into the markets
to buy up Battalion and Spanish government bonds.    Italian and
Spanish government bonds. In Italy they were having to borrow 6.1 %,
that has fallen to 5.3 %. Spain's equivalent borrowing cost was 6.2 %
last week, today it is down to 5.2 %. What they're trying to
destabilise the borrowing costs of Italy and Spain. This is what
markets were looking out for. This kind of certainty in the markets
and this is a boost in confidence. There is another cloud hanging over
financial markets in the shape of America's debt burden. The decision
by one agency to downgrade the credit rating has set off alarm
bells for many investors. downgrade in itself is not
significant but it highlights underlying worries about the state
of the US economy and America's ability to reduce its debt. That is
where the key focus for financial markets now is, namely, what is the
state of the US and the Western world's economy. The finance
minister said they would take whatever action was necessary to
state belies markets but it seems traders are not fully convinced.   
stabilise markets. We can get the latest on how the
global markets are reacting around the world from America and Europe
to Asia. First, Joe Lynam who is at Canary Wharf. We have been hearing
about worries that America will overshadow the ECB pledge. Yes, it
has been pretty intensive trading today. We had eurozone government
bonds doing well at and equities or shares doing not so well. I can
show you the chart for the FTSE 100. It started down dramatically and
then they took confidence as the ECB started buying up the Spanish
and Italian bonds. Here, the pessimists to Cover and they
brought it down. It is bubbling at 89 points down for the day. This is
the cost for it to leave. In the last two months it spiked up. Today,
the cost of borrowing for a tell you zoomed down. That has been
pretty good. It means the likelihood of Italy needing a bail 
out like grease off Ireland has diminished. The intensity of
training has magnified. America will open up trading in three 
quarters of an hour and we will know how they respond then. We will
have the latest from America shortly. Markets in Asia have
closed down. Andrew Wood is in Hong Kong. Talk us through reaction
there. The trading day started badly. Share prices were tumbling
as people did not know what to make of the S and P down great.   
downgrade. You are seeing a lot of shares in companies which export to
America and Europe were the worst affected. People like Sony which
Metcalfe of their sales in Europe and America, their shares were down
4%. To South Korea which is the home took home day and Samsung,
their shares were down by 7% at one point. There was some big news
later on in the day. The markets were lifted a bit. But now we are
seeing stock markets across Asia are 20 % down from the high. People
are saying we are in a bear market. Thank you. We can take you to New
York and Our business correspondent. All eyes really will be on the New
York Stock Exchange? Yes, we are waiting for trading to get under
way. All indications are that the markets will start the day lower.
The futures average is down to send. It gives you an idea of some of the
nervousness amongst investors. We saw the Dow Jones lose 4% of its
value in one day last week. We are not expecting such big losses today
but there is a high degree of uncertainty. Ironically, US
Treasury bonds are expected to do relatively well because in these
nervous times, investors still turn to US Treasuries as something of a
safe haven. Of course, this downgrade is pretty shocking. It is
the first time in the history of these ratings to downgrade US debt.
The big concern is what impact that will have on growth and America's
ability to create jobs. Thank you. We can put all this into context
with our business editor Robert Peston who is that the Stock
Exchange. How significant is it that the ECB have said they will
buy up the Italian and Spanish bonds because the markets seem only
slightly reassured? It has averted a really acute immediate crisis, in
that over the previous week, the cost that Spain and Italy had to
pay to borrow, as Hugh Pym was saying, was rising above 6% and two
wards that level of 7% where there was a genuine risk that they would
have to be    there would have to be a really expensive bail out of
Spain and Italy. There was a doubt about whether France and Germany
had either the determination or resources to carry out that bail 
out. The fact that the ECB has said three St it will by Italian and
Spanish bonds, and pushed their borrowing costs 25 %, means we are
further away from catastrophe. about the longer term, what next?
The fundamental problems affecting the developed world are still there.
We have this massive burden of debt bearing down on a number of
economies. The combination of household debt, business debt,
government debt, a number of economies still at record levels
and at the same time, you have got these fears of growth being
extraordinarily weak, perhaps even in the case of the US, heading back
towards recession. It is that tension between the need to bring
down debt but not undermine growth, because of course, the classic way
that you bring down debt is to stop spending. If you stop spending, the
economy slows down and you get into a vicious circle of decline. I'm
afraid this tightrope between recovery and disaster is one that
almost all the Western economies are going to continue to be
treading for some time to come. It's emerged that a British
teenager, who was injured in a polar bear attack in Norway, had to
have some of the animal's teeth removed from his skull during
emergency surgery. Patrick Flinders, who's 16 and from Jersey, was flown
back to the UK last night with a fellow survivor Scott Bennell Smith.

Saudi Arabia has recalled its ambassador from Syria and has
heavily criticised the government's violent crackdown on protests there.
As regional pressure mounts on Syria, King Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia has urged the Syrian President to bring in reforms and
stop what he called the killing  machine and bloodshed. Our Middle
East correspondent Jim Muir reports The second day of the army's effort
to obtain their resort in the east. It's an heavily tribal area where
killings have repercussions. Activists said shelling by tanks
resumed in the early morning. The government says it's just reopened
roads blocked by armed terrorist gangs. Their resolve may have been
the last straw which broke a Saudi patients. The killing must be
stopped and otherwise be risks plunging his country into chaos.
The ambassador was withdrawn from Damascus. The Saudi move met with a
rapturous welcome from Syrian protesters force of these are
believed to be in the centre of the country for so they thanked King

School children in England should study maths up to the age of 18.
That's according to a report commissioned by the government. The
review, led by the TV presenter Carol Vorderman, found that three
quarters of pupils who get a grade C at GCSE can't work out fractions
or percentages. Our Education Correspondent Gillian Hargreaves
reports. I enjoy figures. I like symmetry.
enjoy investigation. Most of us don't know what these are but the
pupils at this primary school do. They study mathematics twice a day
and they love it. I like long division. I like taking away.
12,000 plus 7,000. There's no doubt Carol Vorderman is impressed by
their abilities but that's not true elsewhere. In her report she says
there is failure in the school system in England, pointing out a

above. Maths is the killer subject always. And even those with a GCSE
at grade C, approximately three  quarters of them still cannot
calculate fractions and percentages. This something going wrong.
recommends the introduction of two GCSEs. Simple arithmetic and the
other focusing on more complicated mathematics like trigonometry and
algebra. Students should also study mathematics until 18. We are unique
in the developed world in having the vast majority of young people
dropping mathematics aged 16. Actually, they benefit hugely from
studying mathematics over 18. Vorderman it likens it to a
language we all have to understand. The government welcomes the report
that says there's no plans to make mathematics compulsory up to the
age of 18. The Ministry of Defence is
investigating claims that a British soldier in Afghanistan kept fingers
of dead Taliban fighters as souvenirs. It's understood the
allegations have been made against a soldier from The Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders. Our Scotland Correspondent Lorna Gordon
is outside the battalion's traditional home, Stirling Castle.
The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders returned in Afghanistan
in April and May after a six month tour of duty. Their main duties out
there were to help train the Afghan police force, provide security for
the local population in Helmand province, and also to directly
target the Taliban. It's during that tour it's claimed these
alleged abuses might have taken place. It is claimed one soldier
chopped off the fingers of dead Taliban fighters, perhaps as some
kind of gruesome souvenir for so we don't know a great deal more about
the allegations. We don't know there sold his name, they rank and
regiment. We don't know but they have been suspended or not. The MoD
have confirmed that an investigation is taking place. They
say the allegations arose during the tour of duty and not after.
They described the allegations as very serious indeed. Thank you very
much for that. Cancer patients should be
encouraged to do more exercise as part of their treatment after
studies found it can significantly help recovery and may even prevent
the disease coming back. Macmillan Cancer Support says doctors must do
more to get patients moving and that physical activity should part
of every care plan. Our health correspondent Hywel Griffith
reports. Above your head. It may not look
much like convalescence, but for this group of cancer patients in
Bournemouth, dragon boating has been one way of fighting the
disease. This woman started on an exercise programme having treatment
for breast cancer. She admits it was hard but helped her get through.
When you're having chemotherapy, it is exceptionally hard just to keep
living. When I did exercise, it made a big difference to my
recovery from the treatment of chemotherapy and actually getting
doing, it was the best thing you could do. Recent studies on breast
cancer and prostate cancer patients suggest increased exercise reduces
the risk of death by a 30 40%. Macmillan want every patient
encouraged to build up to 150 minutes of exercise a week. It is
completely fine for people to do moderate levels of physical
activity put up because we are not talking about running marathons. It
is about walking to the shops. Not sitting down too much force of what
we are saying to health professionals is to talk to
patients are seen as they are diagnosed in going through
treatment. For some patients, just meeting others going to the same
experience helps to relieve their anxiety. I was a little
apprehensive because they didn't know anybody, coming in on my own.
It was complete acceptance. I was made to feel very welcome from the
start. The moment I got into the Dragon Boat and started paddling, I
thought, yes, this is it for me. The evidence on the benefits of
exercise are not conclusive but clinical guidance is already in
place for some specific cancers, and pilot schemes like this one are
being given government support. Macmillan want this to be the park
every patient follows. The world's longest guided busway
route has opened in Cambridgeshire. It's hoped the service, where buses
run on a separate track away from normal traffic, will ease
congestion. The scheme cost �116 million and got under way two years
late. And critics say that journey times won't be cut. Our transport
correspondent Richard Scott reports. Welcome to Cambridge. For many who
work in the City, their first task of the day is to sit in traffic.
This is part of the city's solution. It might look like an ordinary bus,
but it has got a trick up its sleeve. It is called a guided bus
way. Wheels on the side of the bus could lock into a purpose built
track by passing the congestion on the nearby road. This stretch is 12
miles long. It stops at various points. One aspect which might take
a little bit of getting used to for the passengers is the driver. He
doesn't have to keep his hands on the wheel. Look at the options put
up this came out by far the most sensible option. Everybody knows
the A14 is a nightmare. This is a good service from St Ives to
Cambridge. Get out of your car and on to the bus. When it reaches the
city centre, it rejoined the normal traffic. The council argues that is
good because people don't have to change between different modes of
transport. But the route follows a disused rail line and opponents
think it would have been better to reinstate that instead. The council
has decided it would be a good idea to cover the entire route in
concrete, which costs over �100 million. The main thing for me is
none of the journeys are using the best way. Of course, the public
will use the best way. So we asked what they thought. The rail link is
better for traffic altogether. You're still going to get
congestion in the middle of Cambridge with the buses coming in
a force of I think it's fabulous, long overdue, because we are not
coming down the A14. It will be into Cambridge, lovely countryside.
What if it breaks down? And you're in the bus behind? How do you get
off? It the council says buses can divert on normal roads to go around
breakdowns, which trains cannot do. Other cities will watch to see how
successful this is and to see whether they should follow suit.
That was certainly a sunny day when that was filmed.
Let's take a look at the weather. A blessing, the rain over the weekend.
It caused a lot of problems in the It is August, of course. Plenty of
