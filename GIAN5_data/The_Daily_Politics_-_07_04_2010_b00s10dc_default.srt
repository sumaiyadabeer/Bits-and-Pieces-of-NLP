This is the Daily Politics, and another historic day. It is the
last Prime Minister's questions of this Parliament. It could be Gordon
Brown's last PMQs as Prime Minister ever and David Cameron's final one
as Leader of the Opposition. We will have to wait until May the 6th
to find dead. It is bound to be a fiery exchange.
The party leaders have had a busy morning on day two of the Campaign.
Gordon Brown says yet again that business bosses have been deceived

the electoral maps. Lots to look forward to.
All that is to come before 1 o'clock. With us for the duration,
two man more sparkling wine and cider, I would say. The transport
secretary Andrew Adonis and the shadow culture secretary Jeremy
Hunt. Welcome to the Daily Politics. Let's kick off with a look at this
morning's election campaigning. After yesterday's frenetic start to
the campaign, all the party leaders have been out and about again.
Gordon Brown got off to an early start, appearing on GMTV. He
reignited last week's row about National Insurance contributions
when he was asked if Conservatives had deceived business leaders.
think they have been. Can we sustain the recovery? I was in Kent
yesterday meeting people, they said we have been through a lot, there
has been a difficult global recession, Britain is on the road
to recovery, do not put that at risk. Gordon Brown on GMTV. The
Conservative leader David Cameron was also up bright and breezy and
was questioned outside his home about today's final Prime
Minister's Questions of this Parliament. Every day is a big day,
it is the last Prime Minister's questions so it is a chance to put
some of the points on behalf of the country for the Prime Minister to
answer. It will be a long, tough campaign, I can feel it.
Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has also been about. He has
been giving a policy speech about reform of Parliament. He said the
Liberal Democrats are the only party that will bring change to
what they are calling rotter Westminster. If Labour and the
Conservatives get their way, the parliamentary turned on May 6th
will be no different to the one being dissolved this weekend.   
the Parliament returned. Only the faces will change. All the
corruption, all the sleaze, all the big money, the backroom dealings,
will stay. Only the Liberal Democrats can be trusted on
political reform. Labour and the Conservatives talk about it, we
will make sure it happens. That is what the three party leaders had to
say. We will talk about electoral reform and other political reforms
later. Andrew Adonis, in what way have Britain's most important
business people been misled? key argument they were seeking to
make is that national insurance would endanger recovery from
recession, but the Tory proposal is to take £6 billion out of the
economy this year. But how have they been misled? These are some of
the most important business people in Britain, they employ hundreds of
thousands of people and are responsible for budgets of billions
and billions of pounds. In which way have Cameron and Osborne misled
them? It is the failure to understand what the impact would be.
The Tory plan is to take £6 billion out of public spending this year.
It is not specified and how that can be done in terms of efficiency
savings. A why have they been misled? It can only have an effect
on jobs. The effect of taking £6 billion of unspecified cuts out of
public services this year will have a big increase on jobs,    a big
effect on jobs. To the chief  executive of Tesco, Next, many
major companies, they are too stupid to understand that?    so
the chief executive? The cuts the Conservatives are proposing take
effect the day after the election, the National Insurance is not for
another day. £6 billion is roughly equivalent... What is the size of
the economy? £6 billion is nearly half of the Department of Transport
budget. If you spread that £6 billion... Transport is very
important to the economy. This is a £1.5 billion economy... £6 billion
is a rounding error in Alastair Darling's Budget, it is irrelevant.
You do not count the whole of our transport spending as rounding?
Give me a list of senior businessmen in favour of the
increase? Give me one of. Alan Sugar said he thought what the
Tories were doing... Eyes said major businessmen.    I said. Give
me a senior 3100 executive in favour? Can you?    a senior FTSE
100. In respective business leaders, they understand good economic
management. We will be doing this with all the parties, you owe it to
the voters to answer a question of. Be honest with me and tell me, can
you name me a single FTSE chief executive in favour of the National
Insurance increase? Alan Sugar, a very respected business leader.
does not even run a public company. Can you? The crucial issue is the
credibility of public spending plans. £6 billion of cuts will put
unemployment up and jeopardise the recovery. I think it will be clear
that you did not answer my question. Jeremy Hunt, can you answer mind?
£6 billion is neither here nor there in a 1.5 trillion pounds
economy. It will make no difference. It will make one very, very
important difference, it will help us to avoid a large part of Gordon
Brown's tax on jobs. This increase in National Insurance will
potentially mean hundreds of thousands of people losing their
jobs because it will deter business people. Where does that figure come
from? The last time and I was increased, employment rose.
Correct? If you increase the cost of employing an additional person,
that will make people reconsider whether or not they should do that.
So why didn't that happen last time National Insurance was increased?
We had completely different economic conditions. We now have
2.5 million people unemployed, and what economic policy needs to do is
everything possible to get those business leaders you were talking
about earlier to try to recruit more people. In context, you are
absolutely right... The NI increase is not until next year, when Nick
Treasury forecasts and even the City forecasts, they all agree that
the economy will be back to growth by then. Not until next year?
are talking about 2.5 million people who do not have a job. This
is very important for those people. People at home are saying, what are
the policies to help get people back into work? This £6 billion is
waste that the Government has identified. If you have identified
it, let's get rid of it now and avoid this damaging tax on jobs.
Why are you giving the journalists bow rocker in their kit bags? Do
you think they all have hangovers? I think I could do with some myself.
From that to cider. It has been called a victory for cider drinkers.
We will not be handing side out at this time! The Government has been
forced to scrap a plant a tax increase on cider, they have
backtracked on a broad band tax and will no longer end tax relief on
holiday homes because the Conservatives said they would not
boat through the Budget plans without these concessions. It is
part of the last minute horse  trading as the Government tries to
pass things in the last few days at Westminster. Laura Kuenssberg joins
us from Westminster. What is wash  up? In theory they should be the
orderly tying up of loose ends and the smooth passing of legislation
may hope to get done before the election which will really get into
the swing of it. But what happens in reality as the Government has
deals with the other party    parties to save the bits of new law
that they really care about, which means they have to say goodbye to
some of the things they don't care about so much. It is called the
wash up, not the most seemly process and as you rightly said
yesterday it meant that the Government had to back down on some
of the bits of the Budget that they wanted to put through. The same
thing happened in 1992 but has not happened for a while. It was a bit
embarrassing for the Government that they had to give up on their
Budget bill. What is the Government determined to push through? It
wants to save the bits it feels are important, what are they? One thing
they are trying to push through particularly championed by the Home
Secretary Alan Johnson, coincidentally or not, a dividing
line between them and the Conservatives, the idea of keeping
people's DNA on a database for six years. There is a big policy
difference between the Conservatives. They say it should
only be kept by the authorities for three years. The governments are
keen to get that through, because if they manage they will be able
MMX few weeks of the campaign to say that they are serious about
this.    in the next few weeks. It has been a big toll in the fight
against crime and they will say the Conservatives are not as wedded to
using that    a big to all. Lord Adonis, why has the decision be
made to drop parts of the constitutional reform? There are
conventions about how you deal with the wash up. The point that needs
to be made is that one of the measures the Conservatives insisted
should be dropped is the provisions which would have ended the
hereditary peers in the House of Lords. This is important in
understanding why the Conservatives will come from if they win the
election. They are not in favour of significant constitutional change.
They say they are. But what is the most indefensible aspect of our
parliamentary arrangement at the moment is that we have 92
hereditary House of Lords members. One of the things the Conservatives
have insisted on is that those 92 hereditary peers remain. Except
Gordon Brown and Harriet Harman have made parts of the
constitutional reform a key part of the election will campaign, and
Gordon Brown championed the idea of voting for electoral reform, a
referendum, and it has been dropped. Because the Conservatives are
standing in the way. We have heard that horse trading has gone on and
you made the decision to drop that in favour of other things. If the
Conservatives have supported us our referendum of the voting system and
removing hereditary peers, we would have been in there, and acting as
much as. We can't, because Conservatives have blocked them.   
enacting those measures. Why have you blocked them? I am a strong
supporter of a wholly elected House of Lords. Is that the case when it
comes to negotiations? The majority of the Conservative Party are in
favour of. The party did not try to block any of those progressive
reforms going through? If what was on the table was the opportunity
for a wholly elected House of Lords, we would have supported its. Let me
just finish, Andrew. What we blocked was a piecemeal reform
which coincidentally would have had the impact of increasing labour's
majority and the House of Lords and was entirely inappropriate, a
partisan way to deal with a major piece of constitutional reform. If
we are to do this, we have to do it properly. The viewers than the
voters will feel that this was meant to be part of the cleaning up
of politics, part of the change, and for whatever reason it has gone.
It is a great pity the Conservatives are blocking change.
The Conservatives say that the legislation that they wanted to
support was not there. How do you think it will look? I think it
makes the case even more strongly. In terms of who you can trust, it
has to be Labour. When the Conservatives are faced with things
that affect their own interests, they block it. It is a problem for
the heart of politics. Andrew was quoting Alan Sugar as the one
businessman who supports Labour, but Labour gave him a peerage and
put him in the House of Lords and gave him a job. I think the whole
thing is rotten and we have to end that type of patronage. That is why
I would like to have based on the House of Lords, but you can only
have that if it is elected    a stronger House of Lords. They have
democratic legitimacy in the United States. Particularly when it comes
to constitutional reform, the upper house should have a blocking veto
and that way we will get sensible, thought out change. We will talk
more about this, but the general impression of the horse trading is
that these things are over for the Today, Gordon Brown is setting up
plans to reform politics, including a manifesto commitment to electoral
reform. Hang on, haven't we had this before, like in... When was it,
yes, 1997? It was in Tony Blair's election manifesto and he won the
election. All three main parties are attempting to show off their
reforming credentials. We have been having a look. Since the MPs'
expenses scandal, being seen to be cleaning up has been imperative for
all. Later today, Gordon Brown will announce his party's support for
fixed term parliaments and constitutional change. He'll
promise to offer two referendums. One to reform the voting system.
One to create a fully elected House of Lords, on what will be known as
Democracy Day. It's been seen as a way of kozying up to the Liberal
Democrats in case they need their support after the election. The
Conservatives are talking about offering voters the power to recall
their MP. They say a petition signed by 10% of the electorate
would be enough to trigger a by  election. But the Liberal Democrats
don't seem especially impressed with either. This morning, Nick
Clegg said Tory and Labour's promises about reform were about as
trustworthy as a customer service guarantee from Del Boy. Who is Del
Boy? Gordon Brown and David Cameron in this instance. All right. Thank
you. She keeps me in touch with popular culture! We have been down
by Paul Burstow, the Liberal Democrats Chief Whip. Are you
tempted by the reforms? No, because they are here today and gone
tomorrow. We won't see them implemented. Mr Brown is like a
scratched record today, getting more and more worn out. He's
offered electoral reform before and that's off the table. He's offered
fixed term parliaments before and that's not been delivered. We
should have a vote as to whether there should be a dissolution of
Parliament. He has offered all before and failed in 13 years to
deliver. Are you throwing them back in his face? We are saying if
people want them they have to vote Liberal Democrat, because that is
the only way. If they do and then do a deal with Labour, is that what
would happen? No, in this election people have a clear choice between
the old two parties who have never delivered on the things, or the
Liberal Democrats, who clearly consistently have campaigned for
them. They delivered on Scottish and Welsh deaf luetion? Of course.
You can't say they have never delivered? We are saying on the key
changes, whether reform of the Lords parliaments, or electoral
reform, these are things that Mr Brown is tantalisingly dragging
around today, but never delivered on them and never will. Andrew
Adonis, given that you promised this in 1997 and never delivered,
why should we believe you now? have just made the point, that we
have carried through bigger constitutional reforms in the last
13 years, than we have seen since the great 19th century reforming
acts. You accept it was in the manifesto. We have done Scottish
devolution and Welsh and the Mayor of London and... I understand that,
why not deliver on the promise, you were elected in 1997 on a
referendum on electoral reform and you failed to do that, correct? You
have had 13 years, why are you promising it now? It's been a bold
reforming Government. Almost everybody would accept that.
have you not delivered on the promise of electoral reform?
There's a limit to how much reform you can carry in each Parliament
Why promise it? We have put in the manifesto for the next election a
referendum on the alternative votes and legislation is going through
the House supported by Paul and his colleagues in the Liberal Democrats,
for a referendum that would happen next year. It's been ditched.
They've just ditched it. We would have supported it. It was the
Conservatives who forced us to ditch it. Can I just clarify, other
Conservatives opposed to electoral reform? We are not opposed to all
electoral reform full stop. We are opposed to the reforms that the
Liberal Democrats have been talking about. Are you in favour of first
past the post? We have absolutely. You are against electoral changes
that would change first past the post? Yes, the reason is we think
one of the most    our system is not perfect, but one of the best
things is that it gives the British people the ability to fire a
government and that is something that is very important. That would
be undermined by the kind of reforms that Labour and the Liberal
Democrats are putting through. understand that. That is clear cut,
and believe me I'm grateful for a clear cut position. Could you
clarify that if it was a hung Parliament in which you had to
negotiate with the Liberal Democrats to stay in power, that
that would remain your party's policy that you would remain a
posed to any kind of electoral reform that changed first past the
post? Absolutely. Absolutely? There is something very, very
important, a huge Liberal Democrats U turn that Paul has cleverly
disguised, because the Liberal Democrats have always said they
would only support one of the two bigger parties in power if they
were prepared to concede proportional representation, but
listening to Nick Clegg this morning on Today he said clearly
that would not be on his list of requirements if he was going to co 
operate with either the Conservatives or Labour. Is that
true? We have taken it for granted if the liberals were to get into
some kind of position where they were supporting the largest party,
but didn't have an overall majority, that electoral reform would be the
fundamental precondition, is it or isn't it? Elections are about
people making choices, so we are setting it out. A key part of the
things we are standing for in this election is cleaning up politics.
understand all that. Could you answer my question. It does include
electoral reform, so people know    Is it a precondition? They are
voting for a party committed to reforming. Everybody knows you are
in favour of electoral reform. I'm not asking you to negotiate. I'm
asking you that if we are in a hung Parliament situation, and you were
asked by the majority party to help get a particular programme through,
would electoral reform be fundamental precondition? That is a
simple yes or no? The key thing would be financial stability.
wouldn't be then? Financial stability is the most important
thing and key for us. It wouldn't be fundamental? Financial stability.
More important than electoral reform? That's what I'm saying.
Thank you. We got there in the end. Can I pick up on something you were
saying, will a commitment to an elected House of Lords be in the
Tory manifesto? It's a goal, but I don't know if it will be in the
manifesto for the next Parliament and I'll tell you why, because we
have decided that sorting out the economy, dealing with the situation
in Afghanistan, these are huge priorities and we have decided that
reforming the House of Lords will come further down the list. A Tory
Government in 2010, perhaps going to 2015 will be in favour of a
constitution that has 90 odd hereditary peers and a wholly
pointed    appointed set of peers? We are not in favour, but it's not
top of the list. It will be in our manifesto? It will be. It will be
in ours too. The appointed people like me should stay. This is 2010.
We are supposed to be a democracy. Why won't it be in our manifesto?
Look at our record. It is a commitment to reform the House of
Lords, that we support, all I'm    I haven't said, because I don't
write the manifesto    You must know what it's in it. If you let me
finish. That is Andrew Adonis. Gentlemen, please. Can I just
finish. I haven't said it's not going to be in the manifesto
because I don't know what is in. Personally I support a wholly
elected House of Lords, but there will be other priorities and we
recognise, for people watching at home, they are worried about jobs
and that's the most important. of e mails, but just a few here.
This is from Rhiad, who says a rise in national insurance is fairer
than a rise in VAT. But this from John, if the tax goes through under
Labour the extra cost will be passed on to the customer, so
prices will increase so further income raised from VAT. Typical
Labour, another stealth tax. It's like watching paint dry. They can
talk for months and nothing ever gets done. I think we have made
progress this morning, you know. Paul Burstow, thank you. Come back
and see us through the campaign. Earlier we talked about MPs washing
up, but enough of that. What about your washing up? You, the people of
Britain. We have been scouring the promises and we are disappointed to
say there are no pledges of better crockery for all. Here we think
that's important and we can proudly announce that we can brighten up
your wash up period with this very tasteful special edition of the mug.
I'm not sure this is the special edition. Where is the special one?
They are still making it. It's here. Hold on. There you go. Found it.
They hid it. I don't know what I would do with you. It's
commissioned to commemorate or celebrate the final Prime Minister
questions of this Parliament. Isn't it lovely? It's guaranteed to be
dish washer safe, but don't drop it in the sink. We haven't got a

It's a really nice mug. It's historic. You can't have it.
Whoever wins it, I better not see it on E Bay, because I know what
you're like. Let's look at Big Ben. There it is. A grey day here in
London. Quite chilly, but it can only mean one thing, it's the final
Prime Minister's questions of a Parliament that started it's life
in 2005. Someone who started his life a little earlier than that is
Nick Robinson. Only just. Only a baby when Mr Blair won the third
election. What have you got here? The script for the Conservative
attack in Prime Minister's questions, which is unusual. This
is not a leak. The Tories are so pleased with it, that they are
handing it out. 30 more names of prominent businessmen, none they
assure me, reg sterd Conservative donors, who have added their names
to the list of businessmen who say the Tories are right on national
insurance and are right to say that Government wages should be cut,
like the chief exof Corus and the chairman of Aurora Hotels. They've
probably been misled? That is the script for David Cameron's question.
I suspect he will get up and say to Mr Brown which do you think have
been deceived, because Gordon Brown repeating what Lord Mandelson said,
said this morning and I quote, "I think they have been deceived."
Tories think they're on to a winner with this one? They absolutely do.
For the first time this year and they've had a pretty tricky year,
it's not gone as they planned, really any week of the year, except
last week, when they thought that saying they were opposed to this
tax increase, saying they can pay for it by waste, despite scepticism
and questions raised by common Tateors and the Institute of Fiscal
Studies, then    they believe they are on to a popular cause, but more
importantly and this is what elections are often about, they now
feel confident, they have business on their side and they have managed
to get Peter Mandelson and Gordon Brown who have fought so long to
get business on new Labour's side, to actually accuse senior
businessmen of having been deceived. Business has fallen out with new
Labour? What we want to hear from David Cameron is why his £6 billion
of cuts will fall. That is what the people deserve to know.
understand that. It's a perfect question. It is called Prime
Minister's questions, not opposition leader's questions.
thought when Nick said he had the script he will be setting out where
these £6 billion of cuts which are totally unspecified and which
remember and remember David Cameron described himself that it's the
oldest trick in the book. It's quite fashionable to beat up on Boy
George and I've done it it again, but when you look back Mr Osborne
has saved the Tory's skin with Interance tax. He said the tone at
the torary conference last autumn and done it again with national
insurance. Are we underestimating him? I'm going to say something
that he probably will never forgive me for saying, he's rather like
Gordon Brown. He is strategically good and publicly less good frankly.
Those people who see him behind the scenes really talk highly of him
and that is true of business figures, and it is true of Labour
politicians, who come across him. They think he's bright and
intelligent and thoughtful. He is, though, rather like Gordon Brown,
just much more awkward in public and he has failed to connect with
the public despite being in that job for many years. There's another
new dimension in this campaign, given that the Liberal Democrats
are getting equal status with the leaders in the debate and it could
be seminal in any hung Parliament and they have 60 MPs and hope to
add more, I was blogging about this this morning and I felt it on the
Today Programme they are being held to a higher standard of account
than ever before, indeed they are being held to a standard of account
of the other two main parties? are beginning to be. That's been a
complaint that they get away with Rifles, Rifleman Mark Turner. We
owe them an enormous debt of gratitude. They were both engaged
to be married. Our thoughts are with them and their families. It is
because of our brave men and women in our armed forces that our
families and communities are safe there. It is right to remember all
of those who gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and all those
who serve in our armed forces. I spoke to President Karzai and then
President Obama yesterday, and our security forces in Sangin will be
increased by around 500, and the Afghan security forces will be
providing greater support to those in the region and at the troops. We
are sadly reminded to date by members of our emergency services,
and we send our condolences to the family and friends of the two brave
fireman who died in Southampton last night. We pay tribute to the
bravery and commitment displayed by all of our emergency and public
services. I have had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others,
in addition to my duties in the House I will have further such
meetings later today. May I add my condolences to all who lost their
lives in the service of our country? If he is re elected, will
the Prime Minister guarantee that he will not take £6 billion out of
the economy? Mr Speaker, the big issue is whether we can secure and
a sure the economic recovery. To withdraw £6 billion from the
recovery now would put jobs at risk, businesses that risk and our growth
at risk. We cannot cut our way to recovery, but we could cut our way
to double dip recession. Mr Speaker, in 2011 we would use the rise in
National Insurance to guarantee that we fund our policing, hours go
lame and to make sure that the health service guarantees of cancer
care, being able to see a GP at weekends and evenings, our
guarantees that will be kept because of the decisions we make   
to guarantee that refund our Can I join him in paying tribute to
guardsmen Mark Sweeney and Rifleman Mark Turner at, killed in
Afghanistan earlier this week. Many civilians and military people have
lost their lives in Afghanistan. As we prepare for the end of the
parliament we should remember the sacrifice that they and their
families have made and acknowledge the huge debt that we owe to our
armed forces for the bravery that they show, day after day. I join
the Prime Minister in paying tribute to James Shias and Alan
Bannon, the two firefighters killed tackling a fire in Southampton last
night. As this is the last Prime Minister's Questions this
Parliament, it is his last chance to show he is accountable for the
decisions he has made. Will he start by admitting that when
British forces were sent into Helmand they did not have
sufficient helicopters to protect themselves and get the job done?
Speaker, I do not accept that in any operation in which    to which
we sent our troops, that our commanding officers gave wrong
advice and told us they were properly equipped. At every time in
every operation, we ask our commanding officers, are we able to
do this operation? And they have said yes, they can. I have to say
to him that we have done our best to equip our troops and will
continue to do so. It is right that I take full responsibility, but I
take the advice of our commanding officers and advise about
commanding officers is very clear.    the advice of our commanding
officers is very clear. Takes no responsibility and always blames
somebody else. Why can't he admit something that everybody knows to
be true, there were not enough helicopters? Let's listen to the
former commander of 3 Para. He said this, repeated demands for more
helicopters fell on deaf ears. It increased risks for my paratroopers.
But as he put it, the decision  makers, the ministers, were not the
ones driving into combat when they should have been flying. The
Foreign Office minister that he appointed said as late as last year,
I quote, we definitely do not have enough helicopters. Presumably the
Prime Minister will tell us that these people were just deceived?
Speaker, we have increased the number of helicopters in
Afghanistan, increased the flying time by more than 100 %. I think he
should recognise that the Merlins were adapted so they are now in
Afghanistan, he should also recognise that the Chinooks were
also adapted so they can be in Afghanistan, that we had other
helicopters in Afghanistan that were working and that we are part
of an international operation in Afghanistan where we share
equipment with coalition partners. I have to say to him, the amount of
money spent in Afghanistan is £5 billion a year, 1000 extra vehicles,
twice the number of flying time hours for our helicopters. I think
he should accept that our troops, for the operations they are asked
they need. That is the right position.
No answer. I have to ask you this... Order. Government backbenchers must
come down. Mr David Cameron. should anyone believe is Prime
Minister when he was the first in history to a goal in front of a
public Prime    public inquiry had not give accurate information?
COMMENTATOR a reference to the Chilcot Inquiry.
In the last 13 years, he has robbed pension plans of £100 billion   
pension funds. His health ministers said that when Labour came to
office we had one of the strongest pension provisions in Europe and
now we have one of the because. Presumably he was deceived as well?
Will the Prime Minister finally admit that robbing the pension
funds was the wrong decision for Britain?
When he said there was no answer to the last question, it is him that
has never given an answer on a single policy. Mr Speaker, as far
as pension funds are concerned, we debated in his house two years ago,
and the Shadow Chancellor put up the case that the dividend tax
credit    credit affected the ability of pension funds to have
money. Before the stock market crash, the resources of the pension
funds have doubled. He lost his case when he put it to the House of
Commons. It is no use trying to put it together. What we have done over
these last few years, the pensioners' winter allowance was
initially opposed by the Conservatives. What we are saying
we will do is link pensions to earnings, taken away by a
Conservative government. What we have done is taking 2 million
pensioners with a pension tax credits and given them dignity in
retirement   again, opposed by the Conservative government. What we
now have is a national comes as jury fare scheme which gives
pensioners the chance to have trouble the Country    national
concessionary fares system. That would be at risk under the
Conservatives. That, Mr Speaker, is the sort of
deception we will rebut in his election campaign. He must be the
only person in Britain he thinks robbing pension funds was a good
idea.    who thinks. This is what his own adviser, was that in Number
Ten Downing Street, says   this Prime Minister will go down in
history as the one who destroyed our pensions system. He does
ignores what he does not want to here and then tries to cover up the
consequences. People are finally starting to rumble Gordon Brown,
and it serves them right. Presumably she was deceived as
well? Let's take another decision for which he needs to be held to
account, yes? Order, Honourable and right honourable Members are
shouting themselves hoarse before we have even got to the hustings.
Members must calm down. They were shouting out about National
Insurance contributions, and this is a question about it. The Prime
Minister has made the decision to introduce a jobs tax which will
kill the recovery. This morning on GMTV he said that business leaders
who oppose this decision have been deceived. Is the Prime Minister
really telling us that he knows more about job creation and
business leaders who employ almost 1 million people in this country?  
  than business leaders? Once again, I have to tell him about what
happens during this recession and what we had to do to take the
country out of recession, we had to nationalise Northern Rock, which
they opposed, restructure the bank's   businesses supported us
but they opposed. We had to take action to secure a help for the
unemployed. Businesses support of the future jobs fund, they opposed
it. We had to take action to help homeowners, businesses supported it,
they opposed it. We had to take action to support small businesses,
they opposed it. With National Insurance, there is a clear choice.
We can put the National Insurance up and therefore protect our
schools, hospitals and policing, or we can do what the Conservatives
traditionally do, put our hospitals, police and health service at risk.
The choice is Labour's decision to go on wasting money and then put up
tax on every job in the country. These business leaders said,
cutting government waste will not endanger the recovery, but putting
up National Insurance will. Does he believe that these business leaders,
including members of his own Advisory Council, were deceived?
cannot cut our way to recovery, which is why to withdraw £6 billion
from the economy now is the wrong thing to do. Let us be clear, the
Conservative policies would put jobs at risk immediately, but
businesses that raised immediately and growth at risk immediately   
but businesses at risk immediately. For 2011, we have to decide whether
we want to maintain improvement in policing, public services, health
service guarantees and investment in schools? We say that will cost
the extra money on National Insurance, they say no. The public
must decide whether they want the public services to be maintained
all the traditional Tory policy of putting our public services at
risk? Commentator: This will be David
Cameron's last question. Another 30 business leaders have
come again and said that we are right and they are wrong. Let me
read to the Prime Minister what they're saying. Paul Walsh, the
head of Diageo, on the Prime Minister's council, not a Tory, one
of his advisers... He is probably a Tory now, so are half the country!
Let's hear what he had to say. It is not true to claim businesses
have been deceived. National Insurance is a tax on jobs. Let's
hear from John Egan, former head of BA. How can there be a deception?
National Insurance is a tax on jobs, pure and simple. Isn't the truth
that this Prime Minister would wreck the recovery by putting a tax
on every job, everyone earning the 20,000, a tax on aspiration, on
every business in this country. This government would wreck the
economy. It is the same old Conservative
Party. Order, order, order. John Bercow into being
in. Members must calm themselves.   John Bercow intervening.
leader of the opposition was heard, the Prime Minister must be.
It is the same old Tories. To think he was the future once. Mr
Speaker... That is a line that David Cameron famously
once used against Tony Blair. million more jobs since 1997, a
Sure Start in every community in the country, more pupils staying on
at school than ever before, going to university. More pensioners out
of poverty, more dignity and security in retirement. And we are
the Government with plans for the future, they have nothing to offer.
Only a Labour government can do it. Mr Speaker, is my right honourable
friend aware that at the weekend the BBC has claimed Sudan as the
hungriest place on earth? Given my right honourable friend's
outstanding record on international development, both as Chancellor and
as Prime Minister, will use his influence with the international
community to ensure that the helpless people of Darfur and that
region are recognised for the As long as mothers dying
unnecessarily in child birth and young people not getting education
in schools, we have a duty to act. I am proud and I think my friend
has done a great deal to push this forward, we have doubled the
expenditure in real terms on overseas aid from the 0.26 that we
inherited of GDP to 0.52 today and that is a doubling of our
investment in overseas aid that is unparalleled in the last 20 years
in any country. I have to say I would hope there would be all party
consensus that spending on overseas aid can continue. I would obviously
like to add my own expressions of sympathy and condolence to the
family and friends of Rifleman Mark Turner and Guardsman Michael
Sweeney, who having served so self  lessly and bravey in Afghanistan
have lost their lives there this week. We owe them and everyone who
has been killed and injured in Afghanistan indeed a huge debt of
gratitude. I would also like to join in paying tribute to the
bravery and sacrifice of the two firefighters who lost their lives
in Southampton last night. Mr Speaker, today he and he are trying
to fool people by trying to fool people that they are serious about
political reform. Yet, last week, we had yet more proof that this is
not true. The minutes of the Haydn Philips cross party talks on party
funding, here, in black and white. The Labour Party protecting their
trade union pay masters, the Conservatives protecting their pay
master in Belize. Who do they think they are kidding? After sabotaging
this deal why should anyone trust a single word they have to say on
political reform? There is one person that prevented the Liberal
and Labour proposal getting agreed by the Conservative Party, they
withdrew from the talks, the reason is one name, Lord Ashcroft. That
was the reason. Order, order. The House must calm down.
Order. Members should save their voices for the conversations
they'll need to have with their constituents in the coming weeks.
Mr Nick Clegg must be heard. Mr Nick Clegg. Order. That answer was
ridiculous, the two parties are colluded together to block reform.
Just last night they colluded to block the most minimal reforms to
our electoral system and to the other place. Just either    by the
way they came together to block ours the right for people to sack
corrupt MPs and they came together to block our proposals to cleanup
lobbying. We all remember back in 1997 the hope and brom miss of this
new government, look    the hope and promise of this government.
Look at them now. You failed. It's over. It's time to go. It seems
like a speech in search of a question. Mr Speaker, he cannot
deny the fact that when we discussed electoral funding and
political reform the Labour Party and the Liberals agreed on the
means to reform the political funding system. There was an
agreement between our two parties. The Conservative Party pulled out
of the agreement and they pulled out on the recommendation of one
person, the person who funds the Conservative Party the person who
has given £10 million to the Conservative Party, the person who
has been offshore for many years, and that is Lord Ashcroft. Plymouth
has had some of the most significant new health investment
under Labour. The first new dental hospital for 50 years and first new
medical hospital for 25 years. What plans does the Prime Minister have
to protect the progress that has been made and the way in which
waiting lists have plummeted? Speaker, we have given every
patient a guarantee they'll receive treatment within 18 weeks. That is
of seeing their GP. That is a guarantee that we give personally
to every patient and in the next Parliament they can enforce it and
go priority or go to another health authority if it is not met. The
opposition party refused to back that. We have given a guarantee to
cancer patients they'll see a specialist within two weeks and in
the next Parliament they will be able to have their tests within one
week. That is a guarantee. The opposition party will not support
that guarantee, even to cancer patients. We have given a guarantee
to GPs that they must see people in the weekends or in the evenings as
well as during ordinary working hours. That is a guarantee that we
are giving, but the opposite party refused to support. It people will
make up their mind, in whose hands is the NHS save? The Labour Party.
The Prime Minister opened his election campaign yesterday by
promising to campaign among real people. But he spent the whole day
visiting the homes of staunch Labour supporters. Does he intend
to spend the whole campaign visiting and moving from safe house
to safe house? By the time I met them all they were all staunch
Labour supporters! As a result of the message that we put to them. I
have to say yesterday I visited a number of places in Kent and I
asked people what the major issue affecting them is and they said
they wanted to secure the recovery and I had to tell people that the
Conservative Party taking £6 billion out of the economy would
put the recovery at risk. The issue is very clear, jobs with Labour,
unemployment under the Conservatives. Will my Right
Honourable friend heed the warning of the former Bank of England
member that if he followed the advice of the Right Honourable
members for Whitney and Tatton and took action to cut the deficit it
would lead not only to unemployment, but to rising poverty, social
disorder and soup kitchens? This is the central issue of this year.
Will we secure the recovery? The Conservative Party says take £6
billion out of the economy and it doesn't matter. In fact, take that
out of the economy now and there is more unemployment, more businesses
go under and there is less growth. I believe that when you look at
what people are saying and doing in every other country, they are
saying we've got to secure the recovery before we take any further
action. Only the Conservative Party is saying take money out of the
economy now. They've made an historic mistake. Will the Prime
Minister confirm the whole truth about helicopters? As confirmed by
Parliamentary answers from the MoD. He has already cut helicopter
numbers from 522 to below 500 over last 18 months and under his plans
by 2020 there will be only 303 helicopters in the armed forces? A
cut of 42%. I'm sorry that they takes this view, because we have
ordered more helicopters for the future. We have reconditioned the
Merlins to be in Afghanistan. We have repaired the Chinooks to be
used in Afghanistan. And we have increased the number of helicopter
hours that are being flown by our troops. Now, that is the answer to
those who say that not enough is being done. More helicopters, more
helicopter hours, in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan now. Has my Right
Honourable friend had a chance to read the current issue of the
Economist and yesterday's Financial Times both of which say if there's
a change of Government Britain will be dangerously isolated in Europe.
Does he further agree that we must work with Chancellor Merkel and
other leaders and not get into bed and breakfast with extremist
politicians with views on the Holocaust and homosexuals that are
unacceptable? If the Conservative Party had really changed it would
have changed its position on Europe. But it's the same old Conservative
Party moving further and further to the extreme of Europe. Can't form
an alliance with Angela Merkel or Nicolas Sarkozy or with the centre
right parties in Europe so they've got to go into alliances with the
most extreme elements of Europe. And the latest thing they did was
vote against the transfer of information to deal with the
problem of tax havenss, exactly sort of pollly that Lord Ashcroft
would want them to support. What did the Chancellor mean when he
said that the job losses resulting from the national insurance hike
would be managable? How many is managable? I'll tell the
Conservative Party about jobs. Jobs is helping young people. Jobs is
helping young people to get into work. 200,000 jobs created by the
future jobs fund now and over the next few months. Jobs is also
helping young people stay on in work with getting work experience
in education, the summer school levers guarantee we are giving and
jobs is helping small businesses through this difficult time, with
the time to pay, with the reduction of business rates, and with the
help we are giving them now. Take 6 billion out of the economy now and
you put the recovery at risk. Take 6 billion out of the economy and
that means that thousands of jobs would then go. The Prime Minister
is aware of the affect of the retrospective introduction of
business rates on company operated in various ports around the country.
Five years after the planned implementation of the agency, there
is still agreement for companies. Scott line went out of business
after being summons for a rates bill of £700,000 which was reduced
to £114,000 on appeal. Will the Prime Minister meet with the
Chancellor and the department for community and local government and
get a fair solution to keep jobs in our ports safe? I'm grateful to my
honourable friend. He has been a great supporter of the ports and
the jobs created. I'm very happy to meet him to talk about this issue
and talk about what we have done, which is equal interest free
payments that are installments paid over an unprecedented eight years.
I'm happy to talk with him about what more we can do to help. Has my
Right Honourable friend said, Paul Walsh the Chief Executive of
Diagiogo and a member of the Prime Minister's businessary advisory
commitmentity has said, "I don't feel at all deceived. This is isn't
about politics. It's my firm view that the proposed national
insurance increase is a tax on jobs." Why does the Prime Minister
think he's got it wrong? I've said the country has to make a choice.
The Conservative Party have made their choice, but I say to the
country, if we want to maintain and improve our schools, if we want to
maintain and improve our policing, record numbers of policing in this
country, neighbourhood policing and if we want to ensure the cancer
guarantee, the GP guarantee, and others in our NHS, then that has to
be paid for. I believe the country will make the choice in favour of
maintaining an improving our public services, and I think once again
the Conservative Party are exposed as the party that oppose public
service improvements in our country. Over the years there's been a
continual drift away from the imposition of direct taxes to
indirect taxes. As the Prime Minister knows, these bear most
heavily on those who can afford least. I wonder if the Prime
Minister will agree with me that it's becoming time when we went
back to the traditional Labour Party policy on taxation, and that
is to redistribute wealth in favour of poorer people and I would like
to see him in this general election say that he's going to see that
there will be direct taxes imposed on the billionaire rich, who should
be paying the real burden of taxation in this country.
Speaker, there is one point on which I would agree and that is the
importance of tax credits that have helped poorer and lower income and
middle income people get out of poverty and secure their livlihoods.
The Conservatives are not interested in tax credits. Six
million families in this country receive tax credits. 20 million
children and mothers and fathers benefit. One of the cuts the
Conservatives propose for this year is to cut child tax credits for
middle income families. That would do more to push people into lower
incomes groups than anything else. They should change their policy and
help middle income families in this country. The Prime Minister once
promised British jobs for British workers. Can he confirm that the
latest official figures produced this morning show that the number
of UK born private sector workers is several hundred,000 lower today
than it was in 1997? Net migration to this country has been falling as
a result of actions we have taken and fallen in the last three years.
It is falling because there are more people here locally getting
the jobs that are available. I think the Conservative Party should
think twice about their policy on quotas on migration, because the
very businesses they are quoting want to be able to bring people in
this country to do the jobs that are necessary. We propose the
Australian points system on migration. Their policy of a
quarter on immigration without giving a number would do great
damage to British business. As I know my height Ron rabble friend is
aware the last ten    Right Honourable friend has been aware,
the last ten years has seen a decreased investment in science and
technology, but now is not the time to cut investment, for it is in
these areas that we will ensure our future economic success and
economic growth? Record investment in education, record investment in
universities, record investment in science in our country. Record
investment in new innovation. That is the record of our Labour
government and I'm proud to tell people that we are the party that
supports industry in this country. Given the allegations surrounding
Glasgow City Council and the demands for an inquiry, and I
believe that is supported by farm are leader, Stephen purr sell and
Labour businessmen, will the Prime Minister support such an
investigation or is he afraid there's something to hide? He came
down to this Parliament and spent most of his time voting with the
Conservative Party. He should go back to Scotland and explain why
instead of voting for jobs, he's voting with the Conservative Party
in Parliament. Ten  As you will have seen, no sense
that an election is imminent, no party politics at all, just a sober
analysis of issues   not! Hundreds of e mails. Jo tells me it is a
record number. As the election begins, there is huge interest,
partly, I suspect, because the result is uncertain for the first
time since 1992. There were a whole range across the
subjects discussed at PMQs. I will pick a few, so sorry to everybody
who wrote in. Stewart in Kent, there were quite the e mails about
helicopters. He says it is despicable for the Prime Minister
to suggest that if the troops were improperly equipped it was be part
of the generals for producing the wrong advice   shame on you.
Craig in London says the hype over insurance, tax and the so called
businessmen supporting the Tories is another of    another example of
how they are in touch with working people.
Chris in Harrogate says, are these businessmen who opposed the
National Insurance rise the same ones who said minimum wage would
bankrupt businesses? Damian in Manchester said Labour
had only one policy, tax, tax, tax and Boro Eye, Boro Eye, Boro Eye.
More draining on public funds.    and Boro Eye, Boro Eye, Boro Eye.
Another person's about nothing informative    has said nothing
informative had come out of it. I usually ask myself, what would
David Cameron do? The answer is always, I don't know. David Cameron
looked truly animated says one person, Groundhog Day again from
Gordon Brown. Another e mail, and absolutes
drubbing, a 10 0 to David Cameron. That was from Mrs Cameron!
Can we define anything from these exchanges about the nature of the
campaign we are heading into? What is interesting was the letter
from the businessmen, but we did not know that David Cameron would
try to pursue it    pursue a theme, he claims that Gordon Brown blames
other people, he claims that people are deceived. That is what he tried
to link what the general said about the helicopters, what some people
said about pension funds and what business leaders are saying about
National Insurance. The place that David Cameron has always wanted to
have Gordon Brown was a man in denial. He did it on the election
that never was, the 10p tax and now on National Insurance. What was
interesting about Gordon Brown is he simply ignored the questions
about deceived, clearly did not repeat what he said on breakfast
television this morning. But what he did was reshape the argument
into something rather familiar. We used to call it Tory cuts versus
labour investment. But tries was £6 billion towards public services if
you go with the Labour plans to increase National Insurance, or he
claimed there would be cuts with the Tories. We are in a lavatory
for million    a familiar territory. I had to put you off because we
were going live to PMQs. The business of holding the Lib Dems to
a higher level of accountability than they had been used to
previously, do you think that will happen?
I think it will happen more. The Liberal Democrats could be real
players in the polls that we are now seeing, they will have choices
to make about who to support. Therefore, for example, on the
deficit, there are proper questions about whether their numbers come up,
just as there are for any of the party's. We saw from Nick Clegg
precisely what his political strategy years, to say they are
both as bad as each other.    what his political strategy is.
Do you think there has been a tendency in the media, we give
Labour and the Conservatives a hard time, it is our job, have we given
the Lib Dems too easy a ride? Over the years, there has been
something a habit of saying, we really must give the Liberal
Democrats they shout. The danger in the television news business, it
used simply as politicians what they would like to say, they say
that everyone else is hopeless and we are good. The job of the
journalists is to ask questions, which is true of the Liberal
Democrats, UKIP, the Greens, the BNP.
Willett washed to blame the generals for not having enough
helicopters?    will it wash? first duty of government is to see
that people in the theatre of battle are properly protected. Jock
Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff, and his colleagues, have said
publicly that the Government is doing the right thing in terms of
equipping the armed forces. they have not said that we had
enough helicopters, nobody said that. Everybody knew we did not.
When the US Marines deployed an equivalent number of trips to our
troops in Helmand, they put in with these troops, the same numbers, 120
helicopters, our lads had fewer than 20. We lost a major officer
because there was not a helicopter to take into the frontline, he had
to go by land and was killed by an IED. Be due for the defence staff,
the Government's principal military adviser, says we are providing
properly    the Chief of the Defence Staff. Sometimes I never
know whether to point this out or not or whether to leave it to the
viewers to see what you're doing, you are not saying that the
generals said Abbot time of our deployment that we had enough
helicopters, are you?    at the time of our deployment.
decisions taken... We did not have enough. The decisions taken were
taking full account of military advice. Our soldiers will go when
do the job, whatever the equipment. They are so day of    they are so
dedicated. But the senior army commanded nothing we had enough, do
you accept that?    the senior military command did not think.
was not the generals against the politicians, it is a joint process.
Spending on the armed forces is 10 % higher in real terms.
everything is higher, so is public transport.
You are saying that appear time of our deployment in 2005, I believe,
into this new phase of Afghanistan, that all the military advise the
Government was getting from its top generals was that we had seen of
helicopters? I was not the minister taking these decisions.    that we
had enough helicopters? These decisions were gently taken. As Sir
Jock Stirrup said, we have done the right thing behind the armed forces.
When does the Tory campaign ceased to be a one man band? I think you
are probably saying we see a lot of David Cameron and a lot less of
members of the Shadow Cabinet, like me. I have not seen anything of any
body. You will get onto programmes in the periphery of the schedule,
like Newsnight and the The Daily Politics. Don't do yourself down!
This is the centre of British politics! The realities of
scheduling in the BBC. Mr Cameron... Mr Brown appeared with all of his
Cabinet, Mr Cameron appeared on his own with his wife. He was the one
who spoke in Leeds last night, that was all we saw on television. When
will we see anybody else? I don't think you should read too much into
that. I have been sitting on the stage for every single one of David
Cameron's conference speeches since I joined the Shadow Cabinet, and he
promotes the Shadow Cabinet as much as he can, but the reality is he is
very important to our message because he is the person who has
changed the Conservative Party and done some very important things
like making the NHS... One man band? It is not a one man band at
all, but he has driven through this fundamental change in Conservative
policy and people are interested in him. It as much a problem because
the media tend to want to focus on the opposition party leader. Excuse
me! The whole of the Tory machine is pushing us towards Cameron, or,
as I should say, Mr Cameron. How can you say it is the media doing
this? Nick Robinson knows, you get it more than I do, they are
shutting Cameron towards us all the time.
But if you ask them a year ago or two ago, they say that if he does
something we will cover it, if he does not, we will ignore it.
Leaders get frustrated, they put other people out there and they do
not get much coverage. Under this Government, because of the economic
crisis, canisters like Gallup    characters like Alastair Darling
have grown in beat public mind. Cameron is seen as a vote winner
and Labour see this as Labour and ability for them. Not because they
think Cameron is weak but because they can say the rest of the Tory
party has not changed. There will now be questions facing Mr Cameron,
Mr Hunt and others, questions like, tell us whether £6 billion comes
from? Where does it come from? And you
will know that he has spent the last few years doing Gershon
efficiency savings.    Andrew will know. Sir Peter Gershon has been
doing an efficiency programme. He along with another government
adviser has identified £11 billion of efficiency savings. We are
saying, let's not wait for others, let's make these savings now.
you give us an example of one? don't have chapter and verse here,
but these are savings... I am just asking for a single example of the
£11 billion efficiency, just give me one. I have told you I don't
have them. This £6 billion amounts to less than £1 in every 100 spent
by the Government. This is a very small amount. I know. Businesses
can save that kind of money. Consumers can as well. But you
can't give me an example. We were talking earlier about wash 
up on some of the bills that were going to be dropped and some saved,
while it seems that the Conservatives were originally
opposed the Crime and Security Bill, or parts of it, if they have
decided to go back on that and will not block the Government's proposed
reforms to DNA retention. The Crime and Security Bill includes capping
the amount of time that in an convicted person's DNA records can
be kept. It can stay with the authorities
for a long while, even if it does not precede a charge?
That is how I understand it. That is a civil liberties issue.
You obviously don't want that dividing line to continue. We are
completely against the storage of... I think we have a million innocent
people on the DNA database. So why have you accepted the policy?
what a process is a negotiator should    a negotiation. You have
negotiated a way our civil rights. If we win the election will make
sure that we remove the DNA of innocent people from databases if
they have been there for more than three years. We are still waiting
for hereditary peers to go. Well we have been watching PMQs, none other
than John Prescott, remember him, has been busy launching his
election battle bus   or should it be a transit van? It is a transit
van! He is a boundary about to repeat his previous election
performance as Prime Minister when he zig zagged across the country,
hitting people   sorry, that is not in the script! Visiting people.
Happy to have him onside? He is a great campaigner. For them? I all
the causes that you and I hold dearly. Are you happy to be up
against him? Prepare to Doug, that is all lies. Turn the other cheek.
A moment like the Prescott punch is what everybody is waiting for. But
what I remember vividly is how wrong you can get things, because
the truth is that Westminster village or assume that the Prescott
punch was a disaster, but actually people liked it. Why don't you
lamps somebody if they throw an egg at you?
Good advice for the election campaign!
After that insist    incitement to violence from the political
editor... We all have to move on. If he is cooped up and a transit
van, I think there is a high risk. Although they may downplay them in
public, politicians obsess over opinion polls like nothing else.
They pay small fortunes for their own private polling and then tell
us that they don't matter. Between now and the election date,
pollsters will serve up a daily diet of data telling us who is
ahead and behind. A party can be ahead and still lose the election.
Let me some how you the percentage share of the vote in the last
general election and you see Tony Blair, his party, 36%. Michael
Howard's Conservatives not that far behind on 33% and the Liberal
Democrats on 23%. Let's look at the story the polls have told us in the
last six months. We'll go back nine months to August and you see the
Conservatives will a surprising Conservatives will a surprising
lead. 42% to Labour's 25%. They came back, didn't they? Look at
this, the poll tapering, we are looking at monthly averages of
polls here and you can see Labour getting stronger and the
Conservatives coming down, until by March you are looking at only 4%
lead for the Conservatives, 37 and 33. April, it starts to widen again
to eight points, but we're not dealing with that many polls to
average, so no way of being sure. Liberal Democrats, this month, on
20%. That's their best since December. Let's feed that in the
BBC's election swingometer. Here it is. Here's how it works. You take
100 Labour voters, if five of them switch from last time to the
Conservatives, this time, we call that a swing of 5%. Those April
averages for the polls w we feed them in and what do we get, a 5.5%
swing to the Conservatives from Labour. Painting some of the Labour
seats blue. Warwick, Dover, Keighley. Sterling and Popular,
local factors might not go with the Conservatives on this swing, but
the limitations of this is that it tends to give you a uniform picture
and as we know, elections are played out in so many different
regional and local pockets. 5.5%, is it enough for an overall
majority? No, it is not, not by a long way. The Conservatives need
6.9% for an overall majority. Taking Tooting and Gloucester with
that. Let's look between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
Take the company averages. Feed them in. What kind of swing? 3.7%
from the Liberal Democrats to the Conservatives. That gives them
Chealde. Richmond Park, the great contest everyone is expected
between Zac Goldsmith and Susan Kramer. They don't win Southport.
They don't win Truro, in short they don't win enough seats to get that
overall majority. Here's another way of looking at it. Here's the
Labour seats in order of vulnerability. How many seats do
Labour need to lose to lose their overall majority? Not have many. 24.
Put up the Conservative target seats on the wall instead, paint
the wall with them here, Labour and Liberal Democrats seats and we ask
how many seats do the Conservatives need to gain to get an overall
majority? It's not 24. Many, many, more. 116. They have a mountain to
climb. We've been joined by the opinion polester Andrew Hawkins. A
poll for the Daily Express showed the Tories on a commanding lead of
10%. An ICM poll showed the Tories ahead by four points. That is
nowhere near enough for a majority. Today's U Gough poll for the Sun
showed the lead shrinking by two points compared to yesterday, to 8%.
Why the disagreement and seeming confusion over the the lead?   
over the lead? Partly is down to method differences and the various
differences going back to March has been huge, and the variation
between the smallest Conservative lead and the largest one registered
by the on line pollsters has been more than double that registered by
fell tone pollsters, so part of that is down to new entrants into
the market. They see the election as a opportunity to make their name
and part is down to differences in the methodology they use and that
is a good thing, because competition means we are struggling
against each other to get to the most accurate picture. What about
the national share of the vote? Will that give any better
indication or a clearer picture? Yes, but it needs to be viewed
against an average poll base rather than looking at one individual poll
and translating that into how that would play out into the country, by
applying the same level of swing across the country as a whole. If
you take an area like London and south east, we can expect the swing
to the Conservatives to be much higher than other parts of the
country and you are looking then into what seats are vulnerable to
the Conservatives and applying that to that 116 that they need to win.
The picture becomes really quite different then. Does that mean then
that we should just focus as so many people seem to, on the key
mrgenals, that there are so many seats that are already    marginals,
that there are so many seats that are already decided, you focus on
the 200 or so marginal seats? a point. The thing that disrupts
that are for example differential turnouts. In some parts of the
country, where for instance there is an incumbent MP who is standing
again and got caught up in the expenses scandal last year, then
the usual rules of uniform national swing don't apply. The other rule
is what happens during election campaigns and when you look at the
month before an election is called, compared with the actual result,
the patterns are quite striking and in the last mour general elections,
the worst that the Conservatives    four general elections, the worst
that the Conservatives have done is double their lead over Labour in
the final two months of the campaign. That really does
concentrate the mind rather when you are looking at these polls and
saying it's all up in the air, what will happen, it's all on a knife
edge., well, if history is anything to go by, it looks like the
Conservatives ought to win. Andrew, thank you. Jonathan, could you
accept when you look at the mountain you have to climb in terms
of national swing it's all down to your marginal strategy now, you
need to do better and need a better swing in the marginals than you
need nationally? I think we obviously do need to do better,
because that is where the battle is fought out. I thought Andrew's
comments were interesting in pointing out that you can't judge
everything from a uniform national swing. But the picture in the polls
has been fairly consistent, which is that basically people want
Labour out, but they haven't quite decided that they want the
Conservatives in. That's the job that we have got to do. I think one
of the reasons why you are not seeing the kind of poll leads that
Tony Blair had in the run up to the 1997 election    24 points? It was
a huge, huge lead. One of the reasons is partly because of the
expenses scandal, but partly also because people are feeling very
disappointed with 13 years of broken promises in so many areas.
They are saying, look, we are fed up and we are not just going to
give our vote to the next knight in shining armour who comes over the
hill top, so they are saying prove hill top, so they are saying prove
hill top, so they are saying prove hill top, so they are saying prove
That was nine it and that's what we have to do.
Would you accept that as things stand now and it could change
between now and voting day, that there are    that a Labour overall
majority is the least likely and at the very least the Tories can
expect to be the largest party? Andrew, you are an old hand and the
only poll that matters is the one on polling day. I have never heard
that said before. It's, and certainly the British people don't
think this election is foregone. They want to see the debate we have
had over the last hour, rehearsed before them. What policies do
people want? The recovery put at risk, which is what would happen
with the Conservatives or the policies which are enabling Britain
to come out of recession to recovery to continue? Those are the
big issues that we need to address and people will make up their minds.
For many people the news that house prices are rising again is taken as
a good thing, but as politicians promise to help first time buyers
struggling to get on the ladder, there are signs of a campaign to
bring prices down. A place to call your own. House prices started
rising again last autumn, after a brief dip at the start of the year
and the cost of an average home is now around £164,000. I would like
to get on the property ladder. Katie John is struggling to find
somewhere, anywhere in London. very difficult to find a one 
bedroom place far out. When you see headlines in the papers about
prices going down, what do you think? I'm pleased. Definitely. I
don't think that house price crash is necessarily the best thing, but
an adjustment would be good. Certainly, it is disheartening as a
first time buyer to read headlines that say the property market might
fall a bit. That is not das trust news for me.    disasterous news
for me. She has signed up to a pressure group called Priced Out.
Maybe she has an ally on the other side of the glass, this estate is
glad that things have changed since the boom years. A lot of buyers
believed the market would double and there was a blind belief in the
way that would happen. Everyone has had the pill of reality that no it
won't, it will move and it's not the market that will always
increase, but it's a hope and that's what people have gone back
to. It's no longer investment first. It's a home and safety and security.
The Government say they are helping more people realise that dream by
ditching stamp duty for first time buyers for the next couple of years.
There's debate about whether that will make any difference. Housing
is a devolved issue, but the main parties in Westminster agree, there
is simply a nationwide shortage of new homes. They don't agree with
they should come from. A Government minister, who suggested we should
all think about renting, was practically laughed out of the
House. It looks like we are staying as a nation of property owners,
whatever the cost. Andrew, is it good news or bad news that prices
are rises? There's a market. It's not for me to second guess the
market. Fs that is what the value is, then that's the reality. The
point that came out at the end is important. For first time buyers we
made in the Budget so there is no stamp duty and it's up to £250,000.
million. It's an important fairness policy that we are putting before
the people. It's a mark the open to massive Government distortions, one
of which you have just discovered. What would the Tories introduce?
It's the distortions that we would get rid of that I think matters
here. The real lesson in housing is we are not building enough and the
and the result has been that fewer houses are being built now than
they were under the last Conservative government. I think
what that shows is if you want to build more houses you have to
In most Tory areas they don't want new houses? The evidence is if you
trust local people you get more houses built. That is what a
Conservative government wants to do. I look forward to seeing that
evidence. It happened under the last Conservative government.
