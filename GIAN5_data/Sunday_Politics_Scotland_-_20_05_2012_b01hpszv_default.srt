Good afternoon and welcome to the Sunday politics. Our top story
called a blind agreement to promote jobs and growth and keep a Greece
make the slightest difference? �1,200 per year and rising. What
will the Government do about household fuel bills? The police
federation accuses the Theresa May of been on the precipice of
destroying the police service. The RAF's toxic legacy in Scotland.
First, radioactive contamination, now we discover concerns about
chemical weapons dumped on public land. And we are live in Washington
to assess the potential fall out from the Euro zone crisis and what
Air is a complete red herring. You're talking about fairness, yet
some officers will lose 30% up their spending power. A wiry been
treated differently?    why are we? These reforms do not change the
overall pay bill. It is a system recognising that officers doing the
most important jobs are paid accordingly. The system right now
increases pay every year regardless of skills.
Even if these reforms are implemented in full will the police
still not have one of the best deals on pay and pensions?
You have to look at their job but we do.
But is that true? Or yes, but we are astonished at the low priority.
Social services and education have been hit as well and we're having
to pick up the pieces. Public safety is being put at risk. That
is the bottom line. That is not true. You will continue
to earn 15% more than other emergency services. An average of
two and a half �1,000 pair here.    �2,500 pair here.
People will be worried that you are cutting the numbers.
The question is what is happening on the frontline. All the parties
at the moment we have 6,000 officers on restricted duties, the
number doubling in the last eight years.
I need to make a final point that the Government knows it has been
caught out. Overseas Development has been increased by 34%, why are
you putting British public safety at risk?
We have to leave at there. What about as bows?
We will replace the system with a better one that enables injunctions
to be obtained earlier. Better tools for the police.
Things like that have been lost because of what is going on
elsewhere. Welcome to Sunday politics Scotland.
Coming up: chemical weapons and radioactive waste. Has the public
been kept in the dark about radiation at an RAF Kinloss. What
will the effect of the Euro zone crisis be when it washes up in
Scotland? And affordable housing shortages put an end to the
purchasing of council houses introduced by Margaret Thatcher.
But is it about to make a comeback? And an alternative treatment for
alcoholics from Canada. It is a difficult concept to wrap
your brain around. What is going on with care in our
communities? And well the torch relay get you excited about the
Documents obtained by BBC Scotland show that the authorities knew that
the public could be at risk from chemical weapons buried near the
RAF base at Kinross. It is already the focus of an investigation by
the Scottish Environment Agency. Our Environment Correspondent has
been investigating and joins me now. You reported the risk of
radioactive contamination outside the base. That is now being
investigated. Yet you have discovered another toxic legacy.
Yes, potential radioactive contamination inside and outside
the base is under investigation but we can also reveal that the
authorities at the base knew about the dangers posed by chemical
weapons on public land. We have obtained a land quality assessment
dating back to 2004. It was carried out ahead of construction more for
a new water treatment project. It The land quality assessment goes on
to say that the authorities at Kinross believe there was a
potential for radioactive contamination to be present in the
ground and warns any personnel involved in the investigation work
that it had the potential to put them at risk. I have been told that
staff War nuclear, chemical, and biological protection suits.
Clearly the threat was taken This mustard agent could be buried
Yes, a colourless, or Islay agent which creates Severe Barnes and
destroys body tissue.    severe burns. It can release active
sulphur mustard. It is worth noting that the UK abandoned its offensive
chemical weapons programmes in 1956. In 2004, based test pits where up
duck and there was no traces of contamination found   was that
conclusive? No trace of chemical weapons was
bound but the authors of the report believe that anomalies were not
investigated and admits that in some areas it was not possible to
conduct the geophysical Survey, as they called it. That statement, I
suspect, will not reassure the public. It is worth pointing out
there we have been told that material contaminated with radium
was removed from the site during the work in 2004.
There is legitimate public interest here of   how forthcoming have the
MoD been? They are released a statement
Two key questions remain. How do management systems remain in place
if land is sold and the new owners are unaware of potential dangers?
And where the relevant authorities in Scotland informed of the
situation at the base by the Ministry of Defence back in 2004?
The Scottish Government has already written to the Ministry of Defence
demanding full disclosure. Pressure is mounting on the ministry to
release more information about potential environmental threats at
base is not just Team Scotland but across the United Kingdom.    bases
not just here in Scotland. I have joined now by a representative of
the defence select committee at Westminster. How does to commit   
how much does the committee know about what is going on?
We know and absolutely nothing about these deeply worrying
revelations. There is an arrogance about the Ministry of Defence that
is not new but must be tackled once and for all.
A report came out in 1958 informing the Government Act that time that
there was a problem with radium in the ground and that records must be
kept and passed on to subsequent landowners, do you think there is a
due diligence as you or do you think the Ministry of Defence has
been an act of like obstructive? There is a culture in the Ministry
of Defence of withholding information from the public and
successive governments. That must end.
Issue of concern about potential liability?    as you're?
There is a culture, that somehow the Ministry of Defence knows
better than its regulators. We need an option statement from the
Government that spells out who knew what and when. When did they inform
the Scottish regulators? When did gain formal authorities? When did
the informed Scottish ministers? That must be done as soon as
possible. What kind of confidence can the
public have given how this has been handled so far?
The only way trust can be restored as if the Ministry of Defence gets
in front of this and spells out what it believes are the
liabilities on the site and the realistic health risks. Rather than
the BBC doing the job for them of digging up information.
You mention the BBC, could Parliament have been more vigilant
here? With the best will in the world
Committee members were not around when the 1958 reports were coming
out. It is not practical for ministers and politicians to
perform that level of due diligence. The Ministry of Defence has a
culture of secrecy and that must end.
The G8 summit ended with apparently conflicting objectives. The
Americans call for growth whilst German said that austerity measures
must remain in place. How safe can you be from the fall out? One of
the jewels in the crown of the Scottish tourist industry here on
the Aberdeen coast. It may be the weather for these fellows but last
year 72,000 people visited. They came from all over Europe,
everywhere, really. If the euro currency continues to
devalue that is good news for foreign holidaymakers who will get
more bang from the account. But the downside of a strong, expensive
pound, is that visitors are put off coming here from Europe. To this
spend an estimated �4 billion in Scotland every year.    to wrists.
It would not just be this industry which would be affected by the Euro
zone crisis, exports would also suffer. Scottish salmon has a
lucrative market in Europe. The whisky industry might fare better,
it has a huge market outside the euro zone. Oil and gas is also a
global business. But a dip in oil prices is being put down to
concerns about a drop in demand for    from Europe. Perhaps the biggest
danger for the United Kingdom and Scottish economy as a volatility.
Uncertainty in the markets is always expensive.
Barry Porter has got a very early from Washington to join us. We are
outside the euro, but how concerned There are two scenarios. One is
that the Greeks remain inside the euro. Even with that scenario, the
pressure is on the euro, as your correspondent said, and it will
make it a fairly depressed currency. It lowered demand in the UK and in
Scotland in particular. There is then the possibility the Greeks are
forced out of the euro and then the situation will become worse. That
will remove uncertainty about the future of the euro and Greece but
it transfers the uncertainty to the situations in Spain and Portugal
and so on. Under either scenario, I think the prospects are for a rough
period ahead. Which areas in Scotland are most vulnerable?
are obviously some that are more are linked into the value of the
currency and those are issues like to Islam    tourism, and that will
discourage visitors to Spain, Portugal and other areas like that.
The food industry is also vulnerable. I would have a more
optimistic view on two sectors. First of all, even though the dip
in a while prices will not have helped the oil export industry, and
the long term nobody sees oil prices dropping. Any kind of
international incident relating to the Middle East can quickly reverse
any decline like we have seen in the last few weeks. The oil
industry is not likely to be particularly badly affected. The
Scottish financial sector remains in a better shape than its
counterparts in Europe to handle the a repercussions of further
uncertainty and problems within the euro. Given that the G8 does not
seem to have come up with anything constructive other than President
Obama saying there should be growth and Angela Merkel saying we have to
stick to plans to cut the deficit, do you think the Greeks have to
accept the package they have been offered or do you think Germany and
others have to rethink what is happening? This is a very difficult
issue. I think the only two things that economists generally would
broadly agree on are the following. First, everyone realises that the
debt cannot go on and the way that it is. The issue is how quickly you
can really cut it back. Even an institution like my former employer,
the IMF, even their saying one needs to be restrained about how
fast you try to cut back. I think that has been one dimension on
which everyone can now except that there needs to be some moderation
otherwise there really is a risk of a self defeating contraction of the
economy, because there is insufficient demand. The second
thing people can understand is that the real tragedy of this increase
in debt is that this was not a debt that was increased as a result of
productive investment but as a result of the misbehaviour of banks
over a period of time. The more that one can now find some means
the public spending to come up with the infrastructure investments and
things of that nature, the better it is going to be. That is probably
a message that there will be some agreement on it even between
President Obama and Angela Merkel. They have to both cut the deficit
but not too quickly. At the same time, you have to stimulate their
economies which has done quite successfully in the United States
to supply it employment and keep the economy so regenerating. What
would be you're the view of the Westminster government, are the
cutting back to fast and too much? That is a difficult question to
answer but I would put it this way. It was obviously a setback for the
present government when the economy appeared to head back into
recession. I would think if there were a further quarter of negative
growth or even zero growth, then the pressures will start to mount
to review simply the rate at which this fiscal consolidation is taking
place. No one doubts that fiscal consolidation is necessary, that is
indisputable. There are some real structural problems that need to be
addressed in the UK economy on this basis. I think there may be some
greater pressure towards the end of this year if the economy does not
show signs of revival over the next few months. To get back to the euro
crisis, how helpful word David Cameron's comets that the eurozone
had to make up or break up at this stage?    comets. There is a real
fundamental problem and an economy like Greece and I can understand
his remarks. The truth is that economy is not productive at
present wage rates and that the present exchange rate. If you're
not able to change this and Greece remains within the euro, then you
have no choice but to go through a long protracted period of wage
restraint. Whether that can be handled politically and pieces are
very difficult question.    in Greece.
Could the right to buy, a key and highly controversial housing policy
of the Thatcher era, be making a come back in East Lothian. The new
Conservative and Labour coalition have agreed what they call a
modernised right to buy .The previous SNP and Liberal Democrat
administration didn't want anything to do with it.
Owning your own home was at the centre of Margaret thatcher's
social revolution. It is now 27 years since she travelled here to
celebrate the millionth house sale under the right to buy scheme which
gave people the opportunity to purchase their council houses at a
low cost. This woman rents a house from the council but she says she's
one of the lucky ones. The right  to buy let it East Lothian's
housing stock being have leading to pressurised waiting lists. Had it
been a private let as friends of mine have had to do, it would have
been so expensive I could not have afforded it. This is my fear, that
what will happen is, with more and more privatisation, they are going
to cherry pick the people that make the most money and the poor and
vulnerable will not have a home at all. The modernised right to buy
was abolished in the 2010 Housing Act. One year later, East Lothian
was canst    granted pressurised area status. The Conservatives
pledged to reverse that in their manifesto. If you're a council
tenant and have the chance to buy your home, you can buy it at a far
lower cost than on the open market. It is relatively affordable for a
lot of people. The council banks their money for a house and an   
and then reinvest that very speedily. Housing became a
predominant issue during the election campaign with the SNP
campaigning on the record of housebuilding helped by �4.4
million from the Scottish government. We had a concern. There
was no houses built in the previous five years of the previous and
penetration. Reassurance right to  buy is the issue of losing house
has just built.    previous administration. The new Labour and
Conservative Coalition is calling for more Scottish government help
to allow it to access affordable land to build more homes and help
kick start the local economy. available land in East Lothian is
under the control of major Housing builders who are suffering under
the financial climate. If the Government was prepared to
reintroduce the community land that are any measure where councils
could get access to additional land, that would be a huge help. East
Lothian has already announced it will not been meeting the 2012
homelessness target and the issue is making front page news. Homeless
this has increased considerably over the last 10 years. There has
been a 65% increase in the number of homelessness applications to the
council over the last decade. There have been on average 2100
applications for homelessness to the local authority on average each
year. It boosting the availability of affordable housing is a key
priority for the new council. that is done remains to be seen.
With me in Glasgow is the housing and transport minister, MSP Keith
Brown. And for Scottish Labour, their housing spokesperson, Elaine
Murray MSP. Can we be clear about Labour's
policy is on the right to buy? 2010 at the not abolish the
modernised right to buy. It abolished it for certain categories,
new tenants, new builds. The people who already had the modernised
right to buy continue to have it. East Lothian had applied for
privileged status which allowed them to suspend the modernised
right to buy for a period of time. They're talking about a revolting
that suspension. In the East Lothian, only 18 houses were sold
under the modernised right to buy. Most houses have been sold under
the preserve right to buy. Going forward, in East Lothian, do they
want to see tenants in new build have the right to buy and the
future? What the Tories are saying is that they want to report the
suspension. Us that Labour policy is well?    revoke. The council can
make that decision, either to impose the suspension of the right
to buy it or revoke it. That is a decision for the local authority to
make. As it Labour Party policy that any new build in Scotland
should be open to right to buy? is not. You do not see a
contradiction? I do not see a contradiction because in East
Lothian they would not be water sell off new builds? What we have
is a Labour Party in East Lothian facilitating with the Conservatives
a return to Thatcherite policy. East Lothian is highly pressured.
This will not help them until we have heard about the pressure and
the waiting lists and that will have the effect of reducing the
available stock. I do not understand this because Alleyne
Murray and myself both recently voted against the Conservatives he
was advocating that policy. I do not have understand how at the
Labour Party can say something at a national level and the exact
opposite in East Lothian. They are proposing to lift the suspension of
their modernised right abide which affected 18 properties since it
came into effect. You take the point that that is a constant
effect. You cannot or ride the Housing Act. The fact is there is a
suspension of the right to buy for five years in East Lothian. The
Labour Party and the Conservatives have the ability to lift that. If
it was true one year ago that when East Lothian apply to us that they
had an excess of demand over supply, what has changed now and for the
Labour Party and the Tories to going to the sidelines to bring
back a Thatcherite policy? Let's look at that point then. Whatever
the legalities of what may or may not be an Egle and the future, if
all the evidence is that there is a big housing shortage there, why is
this policy appropriate? Labour councillors did not support the
suspension of the right to buy in 2010 anyway because they did not
think it would achieve anything. We're talking about East Lothian.
In East Lothian, they did not support it because they did not
think it would make any difference because they had only sold 18
houses under the modernised right  to buy. There were worried that
people who had be preserved right  to buy might feel that their
entitlement was under threat and then try to use it. The next just
clarify the consequences here. What do you think will be the
consequences of what this Coalition is proposing now? I do not think it
will make a great deal of difference. Since the 2001 Act came
into effect, 1000 council houses have been sold under the preserve
right to buy and that is the right to buy that is not being affected.
That is the one with the big biscuit. If it will make little
difference, why is it being done in the first place? This will have the
effect of reducing the available stock off housing and East Lothian.
Why would you do this if your policy is to sell houses off? It
will have an effect on the available land in East Lothian   
land for housing in East Lothian. They will struggle to hit but the
2012 or homeless this target and this will not help it at all.
there are also an argument that more up focus should be placed on
private sector housing because there are often massive problems
there which does not ever get abreast across any of the
council's? In terms of legislation? In terms of responses. Perhaps a
needs to be better implementation of the existing legislation and the
standards of these accommodation and then its upper level to. There
has been legislation in the Scottish Parliament or the years.
Do you think it has been adequately enforced? A I think it will get   
change from one council to another council. Is that acceptable? It is
not acceptable if legislation is not at here to but that is an issue
for local authorities to make sure it is enforced. In terms of the
sort of consultations that are out there and where housing policy may
go, what should be looking for in the future? We are in a process
just now where we have limited the right to buy and given councils
further discretion but I think there is more to be done. Over the
next few weeks, there is more consultation coming out over the
right to buy. That hinges on people's rights and Landlord's
obligations. East Lothian had a very progressive council which was
buying back housing stock of the private market because it was good
quality housing. This is the exact reverse of that policy and my fear
is that at the other council in Scotland is making great strides
towards hitting their 2012 targets and had great concerns over the
effect this will have an East Lothian. This has been blown out of
all proportion. 18 houses were sold since 2002 when the modernised
right to buy came into effect. It is not going to make a massive
difference and I think this is all about the fact the SNP are unhappy
they did not do better in East Lothian. Before we leave, could you
consultation lead to further restrictions on the right to buy?
Those will be some of the questions we are looking at, whether we
should further restrict the right to buy. We said that in her
manifesto so that is something we will look at. We'll take on board
the views of people and if it will make little difference, why is it
the case the Labour Party and the Conservatives are bringing back the
This week the Scottish Government confirmed it wants to set a minimum
price for alcohol off 50 pence per unit. In Canada, a form of minimum
pricing has been in place for more than 20 years. But the country is
also using alternative measures to address drinking problems. Canada
has a state monopoly on alcohol. Here in Ontario it is sold by
government owned stores. Each state sets a minimum price for alcohol
and the signs are that it helps. Every time there is an increase in
the minimum price or world consumption goes down. There is
also a reduction to hospital visits.    overall consumption.
Minimum pricing is part of a wider strategy adopted by the Canadian
government aiming to cut down the estimated �7 billion spent on
health care and lost productivity. We came up with 41 consensus
recommended    recommendations. They are now in play and a shipping
alcohol policy here in Canada. For three arrows, on the half hour,
the receive a proportion of wine.     Three Arrows. It is determined by
a medical model. Than us and doctors help make a decision.   
the nurses. Homeless shelters have
traditionally banned alcohol on their premises but this programme
uses it as a treatment. We provide alcohol to people with
an addiction which is a hard concept to wrap your brain around.
The traditional method is a recovery model which is abstinence
based. The programme has proved effective
when it comes to improving the health of alcoholics and reducing
the encounters with police and medical staff.
I was drinking $100 per day. Now I wake up in the morning and have a
nice hot shower. I am not shaking and puking.
We are reducing the harm to the individual person. Managing
addiction in a way whereby they're not living on the street, drinking
moonshine, they are drinking more soluble liquids that will not have
such a medical detriment to their body. It also works on a local
level. We reduce the number of panhandling alcoholics in the
community, committing crimes to feed their expensive addiction. And
then a societal level we're Across the country, new initiatives
have been piloted to reduce alcohol related harm. With
Scotland's relation of alcohol in focus, is there more we can learn
from alternative approaches to addiction that can be applied here
at home? Provision of care has been in the
headlines this week following a story of our us about a man in
Aberdeen who had 106 different carers in the year. What is the
issue here? We reported on Friday about Janette,
who cared for her husband Ken, until his death last week. During
the last year of his life he had 106 different people through the
door. The issue is not the quality of care, it is the sheer number of
people coming in and out of the house. They were involved in
intimate care, on dressing, peeving, toileting. His wife says that
having that number of people doing intimate things to her husband has
stripped him of his dignity. The main thing is dignity. You
always come back to it. These people have lost everything. The
only thing they are left with his dignity. If you strip that away you
are just disposing of them, taking their last thing from them.
This has touched a nerve with the Core we have been deluged with
personal stories. Many of them echo the experience of Janette. A couple
It is obviously a very difficult time for people if you get to a
stage whereby you need help with care. How is the process so poster
work?    supposed. In some cases you will be given a
care package provided by employees of the council. Anecdotally, from
Nicole, it seems that in that situation there is less of a
turnover of staff.    from the information I have received. It is
when agencies becoming fork that there tends to be a high turnover
of staff. The alternative is being put in control of your own budget,
which is called self directed care. Not all councils tell you about it
There is a Bill going through the Scottish Parliament at the moment
which will force councils to tell you that this option is available
and make it your right to have it but that has not yet gone through.
With us now, Professor June Andrews from Stirling University, you
obviously have expertise    expertise with a specific type of
client. What sort of options are made available to people? And how
much information do they get about what is out there?
We hear information that supports watch your viewers have said. It is
hoped that this legislation will make it easier for people to get
the proper information. In general, there are told, you can get what is
given by the council, or what is on offer from the council, delivered
by a company recruited by them. So how informed of people about the
choices they are going to make? Is it always clear what consequences
will be of a certain package? When you have dementia, it is
always the case that a number of cases will be bad for you. It is
not always clear that those people choosing the care know what is best
for cases of dementia. They are forced into taking what is on offer.
Are there competing and conflicting interests when it comes to people
providing the Care and the information being given as part of
this process? Yes, one of your correspondent said
that the council were not keen on putting forward the idea of the
person having their own budgets. You can see the conflict of
interest, it implies that what the council is offering is not good
enough and that is some sense it might involve some risk to the
Council of to services have been run in parallel. The one already
being provided by the council under one per person ones with their own
resources. If but the very important thing, particularly with
dementia, this is the last months and years of some bodies life.
Having somebody care for you at home give Sue protection against
institutionalisation. Whatever is offered must be satisfactory to the
cables.    cables. Could contract the Clear and better
enforced? It is proven clinically that you should not have large
numbers of people coming in for individuals with dementia who might
find that frightening. At really important point. The
implication of what was said before was that the council care was
better than company care. But if the council said so limited times
and low budgets with the company and does not stipulate that the
number of carers should be limited, these things will happen.
What will make the biggest difference?
If the people setting the contracts they really understood dementia and
what makes a difference to people with dementia. Whether that be
council people or individual families and carers. If they have
the right information in terms of what will make the biggest
difference for the person we're not trying to support and care for.
So, self directed care, the best thing?
If the person is anxious to manage a budget being held by the council
but offering the person support, that is a good compromise. But the
most important thing is that people have influence over what is spent.
Lots of people very affected by this and more so in the future,
presumably? Yes, and the argument gets
polarised, it is very important to remember that the person with
dementia is at heart of this. 68 days and counting. We're not
talking about the publication of the Scottish Government referendum
responses   we're talking about the Olympics. Are you excited? Will you
be glued to the television? Or are you feeling left out and under
whelmed? It is one of the final landmarks in the countdown to the
opening ceremony. The arrival of the Olympic flame. A carefully
choreographed affair involving royalty. Behind all the fanfare, a
serious game.    game. Organisers hope this will ignite enthusiasm up
and down the country. Promoting the games as I United Kingdom event,
not just for London. But will be Johnny be enough to convince the
doubters?    the journey. The Scottish Legg will begin on day
20 off the track across the UK. It will visit iconic sides like the
birthplace of Robert Burns. It will then head north before taking to
the air for visits to Orkney, Shetland, and Lewis. It then travel
south through Aberdeen and Dundee and makes its way to Edinburgh
Castle. Organisers claim it will come within one hour of 95% of the
population. Glasgow is in the midst of preparing to host the
Commonwealth Games in two years. New venues, a tangible sign of a
lasting benefits that the Games will provide. Selling the legacy of
the London Games here however is a bigger challenge. More than 100
Scottish companies have secured contracts related to the Olympics.
Several projects inspired by the games are encouraging youngsters to
get involved in sport. The torch relay: do provide lessons to those
organising the Commonwealth Games and provide an opportunity to
showcase Scotland, but will it bring about the same excitement as
this? Or will the event for ever eaten set up as London's games?   
for ever be considered. I am now joined by two sports writer. My
briefing notes say, do not mention fireworks   you get agitated?
Opening ceremonies, more on than fireworks. The idea of spending �80
million in the age of austerity to set a small stadium on fire. That
gets me on edge! I am all for the Olympics, I just cannot stand the
build up. Delusions of grandeur that people carry all around
Britain at the moment. I am like a cad that is going on holiday,
asking, are we there yet? Are we there yet? Once we are there, I
will be fine! What is the Scottish dynamic here?
It has been lost on me. I love sport but this business about the
Olympic flame arriving   I have this idea of a plane arriving at
Prestwick and somebody taking out a lighter and lighting it, saying, if
this as sacred! I just do not get into it. I just found out the other
day that the flame is going through my local village, but it means not
much to me. I love the Olympics, but the idea of the Olympic flame
with a Celt, I do not get it. Why are they doing it?
Hype. They only have 10 weeks to build up a great mass of interest
in this soap opera in Lieke. They have to satisfy sponsors. They have
to convince sponsors it is at the forefront of everybody's mind. That
is all it is, just hype. When the real stuff starts you will get
stories of substance, people overcoming odds, a great failures,
the awfulness of failure, the great successes, and things like that,
but this at the moment, it is just I don't want is to be like a couple
of old cynical journalists. Little children will be excited to allow
it into the street and see the flame passing through their town or
village but it is a subjective thing. When people mention the
Olympic flame going through Scotland, I fail to get excited
about it. What about the events themselves? Is there any evidence
at all that the Olympic events have an effect, in terms of legacy, on
the things that children get engaged in it down the line?
thing is to take it further than that. Interest is not a problem and
interest is never a problem. It is keeping them in sport that is the
problem and giving them facilities to continue in sport. Everybody
loves going out to play tennis during the British tennis season
which encompasses two weeks in June. There are no great facilities for
people to continue. At does have an effect. The idea is that before we
had facilities, poverty created great sportsman, especially in
football. The argument now is we need facilities to produce football.
When Scotland had a vintage generation of footballers, it was
social deprivation that produced that. It is strange in a way but in
the modern world you do need facilities. In terms of legacy, how
many times have you and I said, at child said I saw Jimmy Connors
winning Wimbledon on Andy Murray doing this or that and they took
inspiration from it. In terms of legacy, sportsmen claim they were
inspired by things happening at Olympic Games or Ryder Cups, but
whether it is true or not, may see it all the time. I may well regret
this, as it not the case that footballers are now playing to a
far higher standard of the game in football? The game is faster, more
skilful than it was, but we have gone down at in the world level and
a lot of areas which is why Andy Murray is such a beacon of hope for
us. The Commonwealth Games, is the fact they're coming to Scotland
making us more or indifferent? gives us the facilities we were
talking about earlier and there will be facilities left as an
aftermath to the Commonwealth Games. Thank you both. Graeme will be
turning his face from the Olympic flame as it goes past!
Documents obtained by the BBC show the authorities at RAF Kinloss in
Moray knew the public could be at risk from chemical weapons buried
in the area. The air bases the focus of a new investigation into
radioactive contamination. That is linked to the use of glow in the 
dark paint in World War II aircraft. The Minister air defence the there
is no indication of significant risk.
It has been announced the yes campaign for the independence
referendum will launch in Edinburgh this week. The SNP said will be the
biggest ever community campaign. Representatives will sign a yes
declaration in the capital on Friday. Alastair Darling has
confirmed reports he has met with the Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats. That is part of a pro  union campaign launched over the
next few weeks. There will be a campaign to say we're better
remaining within the UK. It will also involve the    involved people
of all political parties and people of no party affiliation. Hearts
will prepared    a Paris through Edinburgh and an open top bus later
as they celebrate their one in the Scottish Cup final. It will head
from the city centre to their home ground so fans can glimpse the
trophy. Fans are already gathering to join
in the celebrations and see the winning team. The parade will start
at the City Chambers and head up past the castle and towards the
west of the city where there will be more supporters waiting. The
victory bus was decorated last night and the organisers had to
wait until the final result to know which colour to use. We now know
The weather has settled down and it will be a sunny afternoon for much
of Scotland. Cloud coming and going across inland areas but not
spoiling anything. Cloud towards the outer Hebrides but it will be
warm in the sunshine across western Scotland. Cooler along the east
coast and winds will be mainly Our next scheduled a it is at
6:15pm. In a moment, we will discuss the big events coming up
this week at Holyrood. First, a look back at the week in 60 seconds.
Nicholas Budgen announced alcohol will cost at least 50p a unit, a
level she says is necessary to tackle the nation's relationship
with Prince. The jobless total in Scotland fell
by 10,000 to 221,000. A cross party group of MPs launched
a campaign to protect the existing army structure and Scotland ahead
of proposed Ministry of Defence cuts.
The UK Government has published its consultation on the independence
referendum and the Prime Minister says he is not bothered about the
timing. The First Minister's parliamentary
aide was forced to apologise to Parliament after failing to turn up
to answer tabled questions. She had been having lunch with the First
Minister. I realise that this is not the first time I have done this
and I understand the gravity of the matter. The fault is entirely mine,
I lost track of time. Looks like the big political story
next week will be the launch of the yes campaign.
I'm joined by the SNP blogger Kate Higgins who writes under the name
BurdsEyeView. Alongside Labour cyber commentator, the lawyer Ian
Smart. Thank you both for coming in. The yes campaign launches, where
does it go? I have written today that I do not think you should
launch a poll on Friday. The government should be focused on the
bigger things that were happening in the world right now,
particularly in the eurozone, and people should be given the
opportunity to see what they voted for last May, which was a for a
competent government. There is no rush here apart from what is in the
SNP timetable. Then they need to take a moment to consider whether
or not the acting in their own interests are in the interests of
the people of Scotland. What do you think? I can see why they might
want to get on with the yes campaign but they do not think the
timing is right. Some of the commentary around after the local
government elections suggested the government    juggernaut had come
to a shuddering halt. That was a bit unfair but there was a
suggestion people were trying to cut the SNP down to size a little
bit and get them to focus on the people's priorities. That was one
of the interpretations, that people do not want any more to do with the
constitution for a while. We thought you were confident and we
continue to support that but once the focus away from the
constitution. Do you think that is true? Are there is a certain that
illogicality and the government position. If they are so concerned
about independence, why not get on with it? We cannot say it is all 
important but then we cannot get on with it for two and a half years. I
agree with Kate. There is the apocryphal story that the Press and
Journal reported when the Titanic sank that an Aberdeen man was lost
at sea. In the midst of these huge international events, there is an
Aberdeen man lost at sea tone to it a lot of this, that the focus is to
launch a campaign for a referendum that is more than two years away.
With such a massive question, do you not have to give people a
considerable amount of time to hear the arguments and reach their
conclusions? I don't think anybody suggest that we rush it but we have
just had this discussion of the long lead in to the Olympics. That
is only a matter of a couple of months now it and we're still 38
months away from this. What exactly is the campaign going to consist
of? A number of minor celebrities standing beside a First Minister
saying the support independence? We know that! You get frustrated with
the process rather than what the Government is delivering. Could the
run out of steam? I think the debate is so polarised between yes
and No And everybody realise we need to get it on to the middle
ground. We need to get answers to some very big questions and those
of us on the outside looking in would prefer it at the politicians
could leave some of the partisan ideas at the door and have a
serious debate about the pros and cons of independence or of staying
where we are. But they need to factor in what happens with what
kind of devolution and extra powers we could have if we do not go the
whole way with independence. I think independence is what we
should aim for but let's have a reasoned debate and a way that is
inclusive and draws people in. We agree, we do not need 30 months of
it and it is more likely to create apathy a rather than excitement.
we look at what has been happening for the Health Secretary this week,
it has been a difficult week, but it highlights again this is donate
their brief. Is it right that anything wrong with the NHS has
landed at the Health Secretary's door? Harold MacMillan pointed out
the problem with politics is a events. The matter of whose fault
it is that there is a shortage of blankets in your car hospital, it
is not Nicola Sturgeon I am sure he asked for fewer blankets. It is the
only way in which people can hold a degree of accountability for things
like that going wrong. She has just unfortunately been left holding the
you might say that! Do you think, the headline set is all Nicola
Sturgeon's fault, but it is an uncomfortable week and also with
July McCubbin. A number of ministers and the SNP Government
have played above their game and the Health Secretary is one of them.
She has been in command of her brief until now and I think she has
actually reacted to some or all of the stories coming in and a
commanding way. She has ordered a review and she'll take action after
the findings of some of those areas. It is an unfortunate set of
circumstances but I think there are two things. The answer, as we have
seen, is not to continue to throw money at it. She has ensured that
it has plenty of resources and pointed out it is not always at the
right thing to do. Some significant breaking news coming in.
Confirmation that the Lockerbie bomb or, the man convicted of the
Lockerbie bombing, has died. Abdel Basset are Megrahi has died, the
report coming in. We're just hearing about that at
the moment. We're still awaiting confirmation about the death of Ali
abdelbaset Al Megrahi. He was in hospital last month for a blood
transfusion and we're just waiting to get that fully confirmed and
will bring that to you as soon as we can.
