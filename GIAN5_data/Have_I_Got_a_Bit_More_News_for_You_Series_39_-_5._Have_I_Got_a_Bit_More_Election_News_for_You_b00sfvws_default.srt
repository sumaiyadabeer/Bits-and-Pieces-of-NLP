like? Yes! At a polling station in Manchester as 10pm approaches, it
looks like one or two voters may miss out. After exit polls suggest

Unmanageable turnout of 65%. What do they think this is, South
Africa? That is the Lib Dem vote being chucked in the river. Off you
go! My vote's there. That's someone explaining they haven't a clue.
People have spoken as Jo said and they've said, "Er, I'm not sure."
"What about you?" "I don't know." It's very exciting. We have a new
Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. You've never voted for him before
and you didn't vote for him this time. Democracy working pretty damn
well. Does this mean this is going to carry on? This show? God!
thought it would be finished this morning, but it's going to be
months of it. In some cases it has! It's good that you're not dwelling
on it. I am completely over it. After 19 years, is it? 13 years and
four days... I'm not counting. Somebody was!
If I was Brown, I would resign and run naked through the streets of
London going, "You're a bigot!" "You can't touch me now, bigots!"
They're all trying to make friends, they are trying to do a hey... It's
like passing notes saying, "Tell Nick I think he's fit, Gordon."
think Gordon has super glued himself to the door of Number 10.
It will be impossible to get him out. He's like a barnacle, isn't
he? No, not going. It is indeed, the overwhelmingly
indecisive outcome of the election. In fact, we only know one result
for sure, don't we, Lembit? Can we get on with this? I have an
appointment at the Jobcentre in Your party got a quarter of the
vote and 50 seats. That's good, that's working then(!) It was a
moral victory for most of us. Unbelievable! Sorry, Jo, carry on.
No, not at all, help yourself. It's just as much your show as mine, in
fact, MORE your show! No, no, this is sounding like coalition talks!

proportional representation." When did the Labour party decide first

how Nick Clegg summed up the night? He said it was disillusioning, no,
disappointing. Well, apparently, when the Lib Dems lost Richmond
Park to Zac Goldsmith and the Ahhh!
Well, in the next election, at the end of next week, vote differently.
To be fair, when he said it was a two horse race he didn't specify
that the Lib Dems would be one of them. Former Liberal Democrat
That's very handy. That is the best thing about this election  
everybody has no idea what they're talking about. Hours and hours of
telly. I watched Bruce Forsyth last night being asked about the
niceties of Parliament. "What do "Nice to see a hung Parliament, a
hung Parliament, nice!" Do you want to have a look at the lovely
Brucie? I must say I feel very
uncomfortable because I never have There's my audience. Quiet please!
Nice to see you, to see you... He knows as much as everybody else.
The most depressing I saw on television last night was Joan
Collins. They let her talk about stuff as if she knew... They asked
her, "Why do you like David Cameron?" She said, "I like him, he
is good for families." What about single people? There's this view
that families deserve all the tax breaks. They are married with kids.
They have a reason to go home. The tax cuts should go to people like
me so I could buy more DVDs so I can forget I exist for two hours a
day. Two single people are clapping. The after show celebrity political
party was so confusing that you actually went from the BBC to ITV
or something like that, didn't you? I was everywhere. I thought it
Brucie can do it, I can. This election has been all about
compromise and you were on the boat with Piers Morgan. Was that nice?
Um, not strictly at the same time. Oh, right. That was in the deal.
Ships in the night... Fair enough. ..Without the P. People are trying
to work that out. "Shis in the night?" Also, you mentioned Joan
Collins was there as well. Jeremy Paxman was a bit jealous,
apparently. Let's have a look at that.
We haven't got Joan Collins. We have, however, got Tessa Jowell.
Is she suggesting Joan Collins has Botox? I think Joan Collins is
made of Botox. Tessa Jowell is actually my local MP and she was
canvassing a while ago in our school playground. I was picking up
my daughters. She came up to me and said, "Hello, Jo, on nan duty for
the week, are we?" I said, "Right, lock it, I'm voting BNP." What did
Lord Mandelson blame for Labour's poor result? Was it the volcano?
Greek? Greek? Yeah. The language. Oh, I see. Not a particular one. No.
Did he blame the person who organised the Labour campaign, Lord
Mandelson? No, that's just fantasy. No. Do you want to have a bash?
I was just moaning quietly. Moan loudly. Argghh... I actually feel
better for that. I can see why the Shall we move on before we fall
out? Lord Mandelson blamed problems at polling stations. Ah, yes.
returning officers had a lot of voters at polling stations when
queues continued to form beyond 10pm. Here's how Mandy decided to
spin it. I am concerned about it because
traditionally, more Conservatives vote earlier in the day and more
Labour voters vote in the final So, he's saying that four million
people who would have voted Labour all turned up 15 minutes before ten
o'clock? It's funny that he thinks there's a bad reputation for
politicians spinning. Then he goes on and says that. Unbelievable!
Anyway, sorry. There is an historical angle to
this as well. In the 1964 election, Harold Wilson successfully
petitioned the BBC to not show Steptoe And Son until after the
polls were closed because it was believed that Steptoe And Son had a
very large working class viewership. Is that true? Yeah. It would be a
boring thing to make up, wouldn't it? The only reason you're going
for it is it's true. How many did you lose by? About 1,200 actually.
You were second though, weren't you? I came second, you know,
pretty pleased about that. trying to offer some comfort here.
Ian's used to coming second. It's a nice place to be.
Often, I'm third and there's only two teams.
No, one person who couldn't vote Well, he was in Hackney. I love
Hackney, and I don't know why I did that joke. Because I was told to,
or I would lose my job. Not really. You can't say hackney is rubbish
and then say, oh, I'm sorry. right, then, Hackney, you're
rubbish. You have to go to everyone in Hackney's house and say sorry to
their faces. OK. And then Swindon as well. Oh, yes, and Birmingham's

Portillo said this week... Well, he will do these game shows. I have
not been on that one yet. The offer will be coming, don't worry. Or
maybe not, I mean... I hope so. That was the most depressing news
of the word yet I have ever heard. It is the most important thing that
happened in the election. Because? That's not funny. I would have
expected a bit more than that. ladies and gentlemen, I can

know. What has been the really big news for the BBC in this election?
Was it the election studio that they spend all that parrot on?
indeed, apparently they spent loads of taxpayers' money on that pompous
election studio. Huw Edwards, in particular, cannot stop mentioning

I think we're going to have a couple of elections this year.
we not make it a weekly occurrence? I do hope so. They have been
equally smart about their very fancy, complete the necessary and
not all patronising graphics, too. Did anybody see Jeremy Vine
explaining the tricky concept that Cameron might not win enough seats
to get a majority? Shall we have a look? Here we have Downing Street
at the far end. He needs some paving stones, doesn't he? Each
paving stone has the name of a seat on it. These are the 116 seats
which the Conservatives need for an overall majority in the House of
Commons. Crazy paving. It is not actually as easy as it looks. Let's
have a look at Jeremy practising that a little bit earlier. You need
to listen carefully here. Jeremy Vine, readying himself with his

Economy goes down the toilet. There's just no defence for getting
in the plane there, is there? People might feel sorry if there
was any reason for you to be getting into a plane at that point.
What would you change about your campaign? Mainly the attitude.
apparently it was caused by the banner they were towing mixing up
with the prop at the front. How slowly were they going? Backwoods?
Loop the loop maybe? It still does not work. It goes against the laws
of physics. Say that in a Scottish accent and I have got a job for you.
You cannae break the laws of physics. I'm interested in the
human story of what Lembit is going to do now. Are there any head
hunters in the audience? I have always wanted to do whatever it is
you're looking for. I do not know yet. It is brutal, democracy, isn't
it? No, but you are. You were horrible to me the last time I was
on the show as well. I don't believe it. That's the kind of lies
you politicians tell. He's not a That was probably the best response
you have ever had. OK, if the parties cannot reach agreement the
electorate may be asked to vote again. If you were one of those who
got locked out last night, for the first time. In some areas the
election night fiasco was blamed on large numbers of students turning
up to vote just before the polls closed at a hen. But to be fair
they had only just got up. In Northern Ireland, First Minister
Peter Robinson lost his seat, which must have been quite a shock for
him, though perhaps not as big as the shock he got when he came home
to find and 19 year old flagging his missus. Harsh but true. Earlier
in the week, Simon Cowell called for a Tory majority, warning that a
hung parliament would be a disaster, as it would mean... Mind you,
that's how they choose the winner of the X Factor. So, Paul, Ian, the
old certainties have gone, it is time for unlikely alliances. Paul,
could you ever find it in your heart to put your bitter rivalry to
one side and form a coalition with I have got a feeling you're going
to win this week. Have a look, Lembit, see how it is done. This is
much better, I love sitting here. have always wanted this, did I say
that? I have argued for it for years. And any suggestion that I'm
doing it as a matter of convenience is not true. I agree with Nick, er,

The would be better if you were me. Yes, I would, but I'm not. Gordon
Brown, all he did was to get into a car, while microphoned for sound,
after having spoken to one of his loyal supporters and called her a
bigoted woman. Who at some point in their lives has not done that when
they are Prime Minister? There is no way David Cameron has not got in
his car after meeting someone and gone, what a kickhead!
But he did not get caught doing it. So that word tends to apply to the
Prime Minister. He then spent 40 minutes saying sorry in her house.
It's a long apology. Are you suggesting there was something else
going on? It was all a bit of a plan, call her a bigot, pop back
later. Sorry about that! Then he comes out grinning. That's the way
I read the situation, politically. You should really write porn.
Now they're applauding pornography. This audience will applaud anything.
No wonder they could not come to a decisive decision in the election.

So, Gordon Brown is still Prime Minister, despite Biddygate.
might not be by the repeat. We could have David Miliband as Prime
Minister, and you have not voted for him, either. That would be
exciting, wouldn't it? Or Harriet Harman. It seems Harriet Harman is
not as popular as a dead kitten. What, according to the Mail on

Did anyone see the last minute endorsements of the various Party
Leaders? Simon Cowell. Tories.
Nick Clegg had Colin Firth. Didn't the Labour Party have you?
Yes. Didn't you do a video? Yes.
Not the sort of video you are thinking of. No, I wasn't. Well,
apparently Clegg had a ringing endorsement from Gillian Duffy.
Urgh. No, the Telegraph asked a lot of people called Gillian Duffy for

I had a theory about why the Lib Dems didn't do so well. They sent
me a leaflet and she did her flier like a ballot paper. In the box she

It is also emerged that Gordon It's lonely out in space.
Also someone I thought was dead, Nikolai Tolstoy made a silly
mistake on his manifesto. He was campaigning for UKIP in Witney,
which was Dave's seat. Did you see Newsnight's Michael Crick was
camped in Cameron's Witney constituency on Wednesday. Did you
see what happened to him? Let's It is going to be a very patchy
election. We will find... Not the uniform swing we have known in
other places. We will be saying, "How did so and so manage to hang
on there?" I mean, we have been hearing from Labour and the
Conservatives tonight that the Nick Brown is under a lot of
pressure from the Liberal Democrats in his Newcastle seat. David
Cameron will become Prime Minister in the next few days, probably on
Friday or Saturday, probably with... There is some idiot behind you
pulling funny faces. We will have to... I hope he's gone away now.
All right, continue! Go on! As I say, I think David Cameron will

He was there it, wasn't he? All that talk, nothing, people did not

Well, we have all had train journeys like that. Lembit, here is
an analogy you might enjoy. An undecided voter earlier this week.

That is the Daily Mail's quote. They said he once made a speech

world war, to which the Mail said he was a Nazi sympathiser. Pushing
it a bit. You have to remember the paper that supported the fascists
