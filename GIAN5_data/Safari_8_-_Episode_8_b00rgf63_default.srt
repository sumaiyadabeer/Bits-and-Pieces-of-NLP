This is Kruger National Park in South Africa,
home to some of the biggest, fastest and deadliest animals on the planet.
CBBC have brought four British and four South African children
to spend a month here training to be rookie game rangers.
Incredible!
Leading them on this amazing adventure will be their mentors,
trails ranger Rudi...
It has taken me years to learn to be a ranger.
  They've only got one month to do this.
  ..And guide Frankie.
In the African bush, danger can be around any corner.
So the Safari 8 needs to be alert and has to be ready at any time.
Eight kids, two mentors and one massive challenge,
to lead two celebrity guests on a safari experience of a lifetime.
Last time, the Safari 8 packed up
and headed to the coast for a well earned break.
It was so awesome, the adrenalin was, like, whoa!
The rookie rangers were all at sea on a whale spotting mission.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Yaaaay! Yay!
And the team had to face up to some hard truths in their mid way reports.
I'm going to reprimand you a bit now.
Be very careful what you say, not to hurt another individual.
Coming up, the Safari 8 spend the day getting back to basics.
I find it a bit unfair that the boys had to do basically nothing,
and we had to do all the work.
It all gets physical in the team challenge.
  Go, Tomas!
  We so want this.
And, there's tears before bedtime.
I was speechless, it was so breathtaking the whole thing.
It's midway through the Safari 8's month long ranger training.
Our rookie rangers have travelled from Kruger to Rocktail Bay,
a coastal reserve in KwaZulu Natal, the heartland of the Zulu people.
Today, mentors Rudi and Frankie are taking the team to a Zulu homestead.
They're going to step back in time and see how rural villagers lived.
As a guide or ranger, a lot of your skills actually come from
traditional Zulus,
such as hunting as well as tracking.
And, it looks like most of the nearby community have
turned up to greet them.
Zulus are the largest tribe of native Africans in South Africa.
The word Zulu means "people of heaven".
Their traditional dances celebrate Zulu life
and tell stories from the past.
For Safari 8 team members Sifiso and Nomalungelo, it's a chance for the
rest of the group to learn how their Zulu grandparents used to live.
It is going to be a place where they can get more knowledge about we did
long ago, and to know more about our Zulu tradition and culture.
This Zulu village has been set up to give people a chance to explore
this ancient way of life.
It is very exciting to see how happy they were about the place.
And, after that welcome, the team are starting to feel at home.
So they head off to check out some traditional Zulu houses.
How cute. Check the bed.
Oh, coat hangers.
This home's a lot different to the home I live in.
My one's made of bricks and is a lot bigger than this one.
It's a wee bit more outdoor and more exciting than my house.
And, once the boys are finally in,
Sifiso gives them a quick lesson in construction.
Most of the things are made of natural stuff, as you can see here.
Even this hut, it's waterproof.
Water cannot come in.
The huts are made from woven branches, covered with dried grass.
It's stunning, the way they've done everything, it's awesome.
It's fantastic that we've got two people from a Zulu background.
Because we can ask stuff that we don't understand,
and they can help us so much more with their tradition.
The women take the cow dung, and they rub it on the floor.
And when you look at it, it becomes beautiful and new, because it's now
smooth and there are no cracks on the floor.
Nomalungelo showed us all the different things, like the mats and
animal skins, and how they actually built the foundation of the hut.
And it was really interesting,
especially since she's a part of the Zulu culture.
But for Tomas, it's not the hut that's got his attention.
What is that one, what is that one? Urgh, it's a spider!
  What is it?
  It's just a normal spider.
That's what you need to get used to, you're in the bush.
And the bugs aren't the only thing bothering him.
For a start, the floor was made out of cow's poo.
It's open to snakes and spiders. And there's the holes in the wall
which means the rain can get in. It looks really dark.
I'm not a caveman.
For 13 year old gadget lover Tomas from Wales, the sleeping
arrangements on this trip have never been to his taste.
I really want air conditioning in the next place, because I am
sweating like a dog in bed.
I've never been camping before.
I don't really like sleeping close to someone.
I don't like it because I like my space.
I suppose you have to get over it.
Guys, you've seen the Zulu hut, you've seen everything,
  so what do you think? Tomas?
  Yeah.
I thought it would be bigger but I suppose you only come in to sleep.
Come on. If this was ancient times, people would live in this place.
They're trying to show us,
the people from outside, how the Zulu people lived.
And Tomas's attitude isn't impressing Sifiso.
Tomas didn't like the place.
He said he wasn't sleeping in there because of snakes and spiders.
But I think he would, like, take a step forward and try to sleep
in there, because I think it's going to be OK, it's going to be fun.
The Safari 8 aren't here just to look around.
Zulu men and women have very different roles in the village,
and local guides Gibson
and Nelly are here to give the team a taste of this ancient way of life.
What we are going to do next, we're going to divide you into
two teams to learn from the traditions of the Zulu people.
The boys are going with Gibson.
Gibson over there is a master spear thrower.
So he's going to teach you guys to throw the spear.
The girls are going with Nelly.
Nelly is going to take you guys, and she's going to teach you a bit about
the woman's role in a Zulu village.
  All right. You guys all excited?
  Yeah.
I can even see a smile from you, Tomas.
Even for modern Zulu women like Nelly, the work is never done.
Most of the time is spent doing domestic chores like cooking,
laundry and fetching water.
It's a world away from what the girls are used to.
  Is this the stuff you have to do every day?
  Yes.
In the morning, and in the afternoon.
And, it's not just a case of turning on the tap.
So, it's off to use the neighbour's well.
By turning the wheel, water is drawn up to the surface.
  Time for some girl power.
  It's really really hard.
It's kind of heavy as you turn it.
It actually makes me appreciate water more.
This is where, if you had to do this every day for the rest of your life,
you would have mega muscles. Yes!
Once full, they've got to get the water home,
and that's a bit of a balancing act.
You are going to walk with it?
  Just hold it.
  Whoa!
It's going to squash my head, take it off. I am not letting go of it.
  Should I take it out down?
  Yeah, take it off.
What if it falls?
One, two, three. Woo!
I was the only one who could balance the water on my head.
It was like, it's the thing that I've always
done when I go to my grandma's house, it's something I'm used to.
But at the same time it was kind of hard, because it was heavy.
But, for the boys, Zulu life is proving less of a headache.
  Ready?
  Yeah, baby.
And, local guide Gibson gives
our would be warriors a traditional spear throwing class.
Do it slowly.
And, instead of an animal to spear,
they've got a vegetable.
For sports mad Manya, this should be no problem.
Manya, Manya! Oh!
I thought, since it was quite close, it would be so easy just to
throw a spear into it, but it was actually really really difficult
to get it perfectly accurate.
Sifiso, Sifiso, Sifiso.
Ah!
As a Zulu man, I thought I was going to do well.
Maybe if I had practised more and more, I could do it better.
The target keeps on getting away. So Gibson tries a different approach.
I'll give you these two, and see how you guys do it, yeah.
The turnips' days are numbered.
  Yes!
  And, with dinner in the bag, the boys' work is done for the day.
The girls on the other hand are still busy with their chores.
What we're going to do now is collect the firewood.
But carrying the wood home can be a bit of an armful.
You take some.
So the Zulus have come up with an ingenious solution.
This one, this is very very strong, can you see?
  So it is.
  Yeah.
  You wrap it round your wood.
  Using nature's string.
So now I can just tie it like that.
Put it on your head is the lady's way, put everything on the head.
With nothing else to do, tabla drummer Kushal
entertains the boys while they kick back and relax.
But all this free time seems to have gone to the boys' heads.
I think the girls are going to be really jealous,
bending their backs, hurting their backs picking up cabbage.
And after we've been having fun, they have to make our food for us.
I think it's going to be really cool.
I'm really pleased that the boys are getting to throw spears,
and the girls have to cook food.
Because boys have got more power, and they can throw spears.
And the girls, they're going to cook things.
I wouldn't let the girls hear you say that, Tomas, as they've
got another back breaking task ahead of them, preparing the maize meal.
And, for fiercely independent Caroline,
it all seems a little one sided.
I find it a bit unfair that the boys had to do basically nothing, and we
had to do all the work. I mean, the boys are sitting there making drums.
Probably the hardest thing they've had to do was walk from one chair to
the other, to play a different drum.
But the maize isn't going to crush itself.
We've been doing this for ages, right.
This is what it was to begin with.
And this is what it was, about, like, loads and loads and
loads of work put into it later.
There's no change at all.
And I feel we're going to be at this for hours and hours.
And I don't even think that they're going to appreciate it.
If they don't appreciate it, I'll be very upset.
We'll go on strike if they don't eat it, and then they
won't eat anything at all, so they'd better appreciate it. High five.
Still to come: The gloves are off
as the girls take on the boys in the ultimate battle of the sexes.
Rudi and Frankie make a shock announcement that changes everything.
You're all going to have a specific goal.
And the team return to Kruger where there's a big surprise waiting.
When I first saw him, I was like in tears, and I was like, "Oh, my!"
It's challenge time. The Safari 8 have spent the day
getting stuck into Zulu life, so what better than a Zulu dance off?
We're going to divide you in two teams again,
  so it's girls against boys.
  Oh yes!
For a reward and a forfeit.
If you look down to there, there's a cow shed.
The losers will be sleeping in that square cow shed tonight.
And the winners will get one of these luxury huts
  to sleep in tonight.
So, guys, get cracking.
Looking the part, the teams have until sundown to practise.
And, luckily for them, some local children
are here to show them how it's done.
Boys go with boys, they're going to teach you how to dance.
And the girls go with the girls. Off you go.
While the boys master the steps of the ancient warriors...
the girls practise the maidens' dance because no one wants
to lose this challenge.
The last time the girls and boys went head to head in a
team challenge...
The girls crept into the lead to claim victory.
And first to perform in the dance off, it's the girls.
Will they be able to continue their winning streak, leaving
the boys out in the cold of the cow shed?
Joining the mentors as judges are Gibson and Nelly.
Dressed to impress with seed pods around their ankles and necklaces,
the girls put on a great show.
The boys may look the part, but can they top that?
The girls are feeling confident.
We so want this.
DRUM BEATS Go, Tomas!
There's no way Tomas is spending the night in the cow shed,
so he gives it his all.
But, have the boys done enough to win over the judges?
  Only one team can win.
  They put in a big effort for this.
At stake, a night of Zulu luxury.
  The boys, they did very well.
  It's a close call.
  The girls also did really well.
  Yes.
And the results are in.
It was a very difficult decision between the ladies and gentlemen.
But I think for the effort
that the boys put in, we are making them victorious.
OK. You are going to sleep tonight in the cow shed.
But at least the goals can see the funny side.
I'm excited for the cow shed, I don't really mind sleeping in...
the cows' area.
  Liar!
The boys, luxury. THEY CHEER
The girls have to sleep in the cow shed, unfortunately. It just shows
they weren't up to scratch when it comes to the dancing, the boys were.
If we had carried on, I promise you, we would have won the whole thing.
We should be in the luxury home, and I really want to hear Caroline
screaming tonight when she sees an ant on the floor.
So the team have mastered the dancing. Now Nomalungelo
wants to see how they handle a little Zulu tongue twister.
What?
What does it mean in English?
It means he is sleeping on the African maize,
thinking of himself holding a spear.
Zulu is one of 11 official
languages in South Africa, and is spoken by over nine million people.
Its distinct tongue clicking makes it a real mouthful for the novice.
But it's not long before the team are down with the lingo.
Yeah!
  Spoken like a true Zulu woman.
  Yeah!
Time for bed and, as the girls lost the challenge,
it's off to the cow shed.
  Goodness gracious me.
  I like it.
Right, people, let's get ready.
Because we're all going to be together, so it's fine.
But it's just, Caroline is going to go crazy. We probably won't even
get to sleep because she's going to be going, "Ant! Bug! No!"
And Caroline's dislike of these wee beasties is starting to wear thin
with the other girls.
Cas, you have to get over it, seriously.
It's a disgusting little bug that pushes poo, how can you like that?
Cas!
Caroline may champion equal rights for all,
but sadly that doesn't include bugs.
They are everywhere, in my tent, in my sleeping bag.
I'm not sleeping here. I don't like it, and I liked it where we were.
I can't touch the ground.
I just took another bug off.
Oh... It doesn't help.
But unfortunately for Caroline, the bugs aren't going anywhere.
  It's just bugs.
  Cas!
I don't like them, I can't help it.
Shouting at me doesn't make it any easier.
I don't think I'll be able to sleep that easily tonight.
I think I might be awake for a while or two.
I mean, I've just seen massive bugs.
I don't like bugs.
Across the village, the boys have got a five star night ahead of them.
Whoa? That is so class.
This is one seriously cool Zulu crib.
Look at this house, it's a pimped Zulu house.
  It's all very comfortable.
  And even home boy Tomas is happy.
  Feel the pillow.
  Oh!
It's the final morning on the coast.
And how did the boys enjoy their night of Zulu luxury?
My sleep last night was really really good.
The pillows are really comfy and the bed is really comfy.
And I will apologise to whoever I was saying that this is horrible.
Cos it is absolutely lovely and I wouldn't mind staying here
for the rest of the two weeks.
I like it when he enjoys our Zulu culture and our house.
The way the Zulu people used to live.
So, I'm happy that he's happy.
Across in the cow shed,
was it sweet dreams for Caroline, or a beastie nightmare?
I didn't sleep very well last night, because I think I fell asleep first.
But then I woke up really early.
And I swear that little millipede thing came back in again,
because I could hear loads of tiny little legs.
When it came back, I wasn't sure if anything had crawled into my bag,
so I couldn't go back in it and I had to sit like this.
I didn't mean to, but I chucked a spider on your pillow.
It was dead, though.
Because I found it in my bag.
  Did you kill it?
  No. Well, I must have squished it.
The rookie rangers have just two weeks to overcome any fears,
and get prepared for the final challenge.
So far, they know they'll have to track the Big Five for their guests,
and set up camp.
But, as they're about to find out, that's not all.
For the final challenge, you are all going to have a specific role.
There is going to be one Head Ranger, two Trackers, three Guides,
and two people in hospitality.
Not only have Rudi and Frankie been making sure the Safari 8
have all the skills they need for the final challenge,
they've also been assessing which role would best suit each member.
The Head Guide, or Head Ranger, will be in charge of everything.
Each of the Safari 8 will have the chance to show the mentors
their leadership skills.
But, only one can be chosen for the final challenge.
As a tracker, your main job is to read tracks. Try and find animals.
Two Trackers will take on the task of finding the animals.
It's a big responsibility, so the right two people must be chosen.
As a guide, you're going to be the link between nature and your guests.
And that means they'll need to know everything about the Big Five and
any other animals they might see. And that's a tall order.
As hospitality, you are in charge of entertainment,
the food and that there's enough of everything for the guests.
Possibly one of the hardest jobs, the two rookie rangers who end up
in hospitality will need to cater for the guests' every whim.
After living together for two weeks,
Sifiso has got a good idea what role would suit team mate Tomas.
I think Tomas plays a lot. Sometimes it can get a bit irritating.
So, I think he is going to take the hospitality or something else.
But I think, just like they say, do not mix business with pleasure.
  But Kushal is not so sure.
  I don't think that Tomas would
be able to do the hospitality role
at all, because he is not very organised and stuff like that.
If you see his room, there's stuff lying everywhere.
There is one role that most of the team have their eye on.
If I'm heading for anything, it's really the Head Ranger role.
I'll try to ensure that I get the role that I want by
just trying my best at everything.
But there's tough competition.
The role I would like to take would definitely be Head Ranger.
I love leading, it's really fun.
And what about everybody else?
Ella would be a good Tracker, as she's good at identifying things.
Nomalungelo would make a good hospitality.
She's good at organising.
Caroline would also make a good Guide.
She's really good at that kind of stuff.
Looks like someone has got the final challenge sorted, then.
More or less.
So, with no time to waste,
the team head back to Kruger to complete their ranger training.
As the sun sets for the day, the Safari 8 arrive back in camp.
The team have been away from their homes for two weeks,
and everyone is starting to miss friends and family.
So, Rudi and Frankie have some messages waiting for them.
And first to hear from her nearest and dearest is Ashleigh.
Hi, Ashleigh, we miss you.
  Sh!
  Everything is not the same. School is quiet, the house is quiet.
I definitely found the whole thing really emotional, because
it wasn't just me who hadn't seen my family, it was seven other kids.
Hi, Ashleigh. I'm missing you lots.
I hope you're having lots of fun there.
The whole thing was really nice.
I was speechless, it was so breathtaking the whole thing.
Keep being who you are, and I'm very, very proud of you.
  And I love you lots.
  I love you too!
Hi, Kushal. It's really weird without you, I think.
It's really weird. We really miss you. I love you lots.
I hope you're having lots of fun and learning lots of things so...
Hi, Kushal. I think you are all right.
I miss you...
  Look after yourself. Thank you.
  Aw!
Love you!
Your granny was gorgeous!
I feel, like, all squishy inside now.
  That's much better.
I wish you a very good time
at Kruger National Park.
Just be good, my child.
When I first saw my mum, I was in tears. I was like, "Oh, my".
It was this feeling that I really,
really needed all this time and I was so grateful for it.
I was really happy.
Pretty, in class, it's very boring without you. We miss you dearly.
And we can't wait before you come back and tell us
all about your experience there.
  Do you have that warm, mushy feeling inside you?
  Yeah.
Hello, Ella.
We hope you're having a lovely, lovely time.
Don't worry, we'll all still be here when you come back.
So make the most of it and enjoy yourself.
And I'm sure you're not missing your mobile phone, are you?
And I hope you like eating,
if you do eat elephant testicles, and lizard tails.
If you get the chance, you should.
We miss you lots, have a lovely time.
Always thinking of you, that's the main thing.
  That was so sweet.
Have fun, enjoy yourself there.
Yeah, peace out. We love you, man.
Make sure that you keep it our way. Go "hasla"!
I wanted to cry, but at the same time I didn't want to show my tears.
But...they said "hasla" and stuff like that.
It felt very sad, at the very same time I was very excited.
You are a very good boy. There is
no good boy like you in the whole world, according to your father.
Those strong words that were given from my family encouraged me a lot.
Look after yourself very well, wherever you go.
  How do you feel after that?
  I feel like crying.
You all right, yeah?
Hi, Caroline, we've been missing you.
  How are you doing?
  Miss you.
  We all hope you're having a ball.
Remember the thing we said before you left.
Take time to breathe at night, look at the stars and keep these memories
  forever.
  And watch out for midgies!
Bye! Have lots of fun, see you soon.
  Aw!
  When I got the message from home,
it was such a great feeling to just see them there. I was like, "Hoooo".
It has definitely given me this massive boost to keep on going,
to do them proud.
Next time on Safari 8, the team have a close encounter with a cheetah.
I find this experience fantastic.
I just touched a cheetah!
Get to feed a young orphan.
And there's trouble in camp.
Oh, Ashleigh, you stupid...
