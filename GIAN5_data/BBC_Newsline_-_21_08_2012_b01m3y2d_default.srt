Good evening. This is BBC Newsline with Donna Traynor. The headlines
this Tuesday evening: Three members of the Jordanian paralympic team
are arrested over allegations of sexual assault. Could Northern
Ireland end up with the toughest anti prostitution laws in the UK. A
former world champion says boxing fans guilty of sectarian abuse
should be banned from the ringside. It is the people who are following
the fighters. They must be earmarked, pointed out and kicked
out of the boxing rings in the country. They are the ones bringing
the game into disrepute. How many local students could get free
university places in Scotland? Trust me, I'm a robot. The new
doctor doing the ward rounds in Newry. And it's been an exciting
hailstones. I'll be back with the Three members of the Paralympic
squad from Jordan having been arrested over allegations of sexual
assault. The squad were part of a pre games training camp at the
Antrim Forum. Our reporter Conor Macauley is there. What do we know?
Three men were arrested on Monday after three local women made
allegations including one of sexual assault. It was something that
happened here at the Antrim Forum. The squad and their support staff
have been here for a couple of weeks. The three men arrested are
aged 36, 35 and 23. They are still in police custody. There was some
delay in beginning the process of questioning the men today because
the police have to wait for interpreters to join them before
they can begin the process. What sort of official reaction has there
been to this? The Sports Minister, champion of the Olympic teams who
came to use our facilities, we asked if they had anything to say.
They said because there is alive investigation on going at the
moment they could not comment. The Jordanian team had been due to
leave Northern Ireland to travel to London for the Paralympic Games
quick start next Wednesday, the question now remains is how many of
that delegation will make it onto the flight tomorrow? Paying for sex
with prostitutes could be outlawed if Stormont passes a new bill, the
details of which were published today. The proposals, which are
being brought forward by the DUP's Lord Morrow, would give Northern
Ireland tougher laws than in Britain. As Mervyn Jess reports,
the main aim of the proposed law is to tackle people trafficking. It
has been referred to as the oldest profession in the world but that
nevertheless does not make it any more palatable end they eyes of the
public. Today, Lord Morro launched his private member's bill which she
says goes further than the current legislation making its way through
Stormont.    Lord Morrow. person who purchases intercourse
will be the one who ends up in court. If you buy you are then be
offender. Last year alone it was estimated men in Northern Ireland
were spending up to half a million pounds on prostitutes every week.
Police have been raiding brothels. They dealt with the 33 potential
victims of trafficking. 18 of those were females who had been brought
here specifically for its sexual exploitation. Two people have been
convicted of trafficking with a further two due in court on similar
charges. This is the only way to end this crime. It is growing year 
on year across the so called civilised world. It is there, it is
evident, it is very hard to nail the people behind it, the gangs.
All of us need to wake up. The then you are using these services need
to wake up and see what they are doing. It is not about personal
pleasure, it is about engaging in the slave trade. The use can be
made known until the middle of the month, October sees anti slavery
day and that is no coincidence. Earlier I spoke asked our Political
Editor Mark Devenport and asked him what the chances were of these
proposals becoming law? It is uncertain. You have got to remember
this is a private member's bill, a lot of these do not become law
because they do not have sufficient time to be debated in chamber. It
needs all parties to get on side with this proposal to give their
backing and get it through with bolts and cost will there be the
time to be debated.    votes. The question will be whether the
consensus on the need for human trafficking can be extended among
the other parties for the consensus that all prostitution be banned.
seems that a change in the lock in regards to prostitution to be
connected with something had that happened last week Down South?
There was a consultation last week by the Southern Irish Government
and there was a consultation in Scotland to make paying for
intercourse illegal. That did not get through as wanted. It was
proposed by Harry it Hammond in 2007 and it did not make it into
law but they did push through with the lot to say it is illegal to pay
for intercourse with someone who has been trafficked.    Harriet
Harman. I think there was some opposition to it from those who
thought the State was over reaching itself by telling adults what they
could or could not do. It was felt this might drive the oldest
profession underground and make the situation more vulnerable for the
women involved. It might come down to whether the politicians believe
that the situation in Sweden has helped curb the problems associated
with human trafficking. The Irish boxing authorities have rejected
claims that they've failed to deal with sectarian abuse aimed at a
boxing club from Sandy Row in Belfast. The club say they've
suffered a decade of abuse without any action being taken. Julian
O'Neill reports. Best man watches from outside the ring. He once
boxed at best club but quit the sport after receiving sectarian
abuse at a competition hosted in and nationalist area. I hate it. I
felt so scared in some places. Up on the Falls Road you were not made
to feel comfortable at all. Witness the symbolism of these champions
during the Olympic torch relay but some say sectarianism is hidden
away. The club's bus has been stoned and bottles thrown at those
attending amateur bouts. Officials from several other boxing clubs in
nationalist area is said today they did not perceive any sectarian
problem in the sport or at least not one as bad as is pointed out in
this 27 page report which includes details of letters of complaints to
the sporting body. The Irish Amateur Boxing Association is
investigating and rejects the claims that this issue is a low
priority. We met with the association in February 2011,
nothing has happened in the last 18 months. We saw yesterday in the
Irish Times it was stated that there is an investigation but I
think it must be bottom of the pile of things to do. Before turning pro
this man was on the amateur circuit like many of the Olympic medal
winners. It taints the whole thing. I would love to see the Amateur
Boxing Association clamp down on this big style. The Department of
Culture, Ards and leisure is aware of the complaints and say officials
are addressing the issue.    Arts and Leisure. Earlier this year we
highlighted a loophole which would allow students with an Irish
passport to get free tuition in a Scottish university. It was a
tempting option for students in an east Belfast school where most have
British passports. The saving could be tens of thousands of pounds. Our
education correspondent, Maggie Taggart has returned to speak to
some of the students to find out if free tuition is now a reality for
them. We first met these students in the spring. Since then they have
been studying, doing exams and getting results in the hope of
getting three university tuition in Scotland.    free. This girl now
has an offer of free tuition at Edinburgh University. It has been a
long process, I am so happy about it. I will save �9,000. She now has
a letter assuring her she will not have to pay. Her status is EU so
her feet will be �1,820 and we have a letter from Scotland seeing it
will be paid on her behalf.    say. She has nothing to pay this here be
wise, we are delighted. This boy has been accepted at Glasgow
university but he has not yet had a formal letter. He has had another
form to fill in. The form we would have to complete to answer all the
questions with regard to our fees that is is very lengthy, about four
pages long with 16 pages of accompanying notes which are a
minefield to wade through. I am still hopeful that we will be
successful. They have saved money for the university course but they
   bet they do not get free fees they will be in disarray. I am
fairly confident, I have got on OK at several stages but is there is
still that little niggle of uncertainty because we do not have
a formal written paper saying that I am in for free. The Scottish
Government says it cannot yet tell how many Northern Irish students
will get free education but they are looking at ways to block the
loophole in the future. You're watching BBC Newsline and still to
come on the programme: We're live backstage at Tennents' Vital,
hearing from the up and coming Moira band who kicked the whole
A family of five laughing at Glenarm in County Antrim say they
may have to move after an arson attack on their home. A door was
damaged at the property when a tyre filled with flammable liquid was
put against it and set on fire. In neighbour raised the alarm after
seeing flames. Villagers say they are shocked at the attack. I think
it is ridiculous. It is a poor reflection of Glenarm. The family
should not be moving from the village, it is the people who
perpetrated this crime. A 55 year  old man has been arrested in south
Belfast in connection with the a murder on the outskirts of the city
36 years ago. William Palmer was 55 and died after he was shot in his
home. The man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and membership
of the IRA. As we reported yesterday, the
police have made a fulsome apology to the mayor of Derry after
mistakenly raided his house during an anti terrorist operation last
month. But the Sinn Fein councillor says that words do not go far
enough. Kevin Campbell is in our foil.
You have got an apology, what more do you want? And all but the case
is going to the ombudsman and I am prepared to wait for the outcome.  
  I am told that the case. Do you not accept that mistakes can
happen? Yes, they can. In this instance, the reality is that when
the police came to my home, it was at 10:30pm and the officers
recognise who I was and were not prepared to enter the home. What
happened was that it was a to ing and fro ing between Derry and
Belfast. Someone at 4:30am decided to go ahead and searched the
property. There was no one in the house. This indicates everything I
said at the time. Earlier, you said that he wanted the officer who made
the author    who made the order to be sacked. Is that they're?    is
that fair. I am prepared to sit down with them. I know it has been
put to the ombudsman's office. Let's wait and see the outcome of
this process. At the end of the day, this was wrong and it should never
have happened. When I was made the mayor of this city, I said I would
work for all the people of the city. This left a cloud hanging over me,
within the Unionist and Protestant community. The police have admitted
it was a mistake and they have made a fulsome apology. Gregory Campbell
the DUP said that it is time now to focus on the weapons that were
seized by police earlier in that operation. NEWLINE deflecting away
from the battle against dissident republicans.    You are deflecting.
The police are dealing with that issue. The issue would mean, do was
a wrong done and the police have admitted.    the issue with me,
there was a wrong done. I'm prepared to see the outcome before
I take anything further. There is a new addition to the medical team at
Daisy Hill Hospital. He does not wear the usual attire, he does not
take temperatures or give injections, but he is still
regarded as an important part of the team.
It is not a Ballack, it is a doctor. Doctor Who? The man on the screen
is Charles McAllister, one of 18 of intensive care specialists based
not in Newry but 20 miles away in Craigavon. Can you hear me OK?
is Charlie. Do you mind talking to me through the robot? What is the
story. Unlike Craigavon Hospital, Daisy Hill does not have an
intensive care unit. But now intensive care staff at Craigavon
can monitor patients in Newry remotely, thanks to the robot.
you comfortable? It has been great so far. The number of patients we
have been transferring has reduced and we are able to take patients   
keep patients up to date with out there doing. We have a better
understanding of the natures of the problems when they do arrive.
staff were initially suspicious of a robot on the ward. Having seen it
in action, it is a real benefit to the care that patients receive.
Sometimes we require the assistance of experts, and to have won at the
bedside is a bonus. The trust says that so far the robot has gone down
well with patients. It is brilliant. He is easy to get on with and talk
to. He is over in Craigavon, and we're here and he can talk to us.
These investments will greatly assist us in providing the best
possible care. And doing it in an efficient manner as well. It may be
the height of technical sophistication, but the result was
a downside. Like a Telek, the robot cannot go upstairs.    Ballack.
the left! Joanna Mills has yet to decide if she will switch
allegiance from Ireland to Great Britain. After a long process of
appeals, she controversially missed out on a place in the Irish 4x4 or
   for by 400 metre relay for the Olympics. She ran faster times than
Catriona Cuddihy, who was included in the squad.
I was struggling watching the Olympics because I thought that the
opportunity would have been unbelievable, but I still enjoyed
watching it. It was difficult because it was a home Olympics and
it was more in our face. But I learned so much. The highs and lows,
but I experienced. Are you still considering competing for Ireland?
Are will have to think about it. I will have to sit down and chat
about next year, and how everything will fall. I do not want to make
any decisions just yet. The way the situation was handled has
highlighted a lot of things to me. Ireland have been very good to me.
I cannot forget about that. Have you spoken to the girls? I have not
heard from that. I heard a lot on Twitter before the race and then
after the race there was support for them, which was good to see. I
have not seen any of them since. You mention your family, and your
fellow athletes. How much support did you receive from people outside
of that group? Will loads. I cannot get over it.    loads. 500
different people following me, at telling me that I was hard done by.
I could not get over it. I was surprised that people knew about it.
Every comment was red and appreciated. There was a lot of
support from down south, which was surprising, because I think a lot
of people thought it was political and they do not think it was. At
the same time, it meant a lot to me to get support from such a variety
of different people. You spoke about making a decision. When do
you expect to make that decision and what will you weigh up? I have
my last competition this weekend. After that I will sit down and talk
about my plans. We will look at how the season is looking. Obviously,
international opportunities, or are they fall, there are different
regulations that come into it. I do not want to accept and rush into
anything because Ireland have been good to me. At the same time, I
need to think about where I go from here.
Thousands of rock fans are gathering in south Belfast for one
of this year's biggest music events, the tennis vital Festival.   
Tennants Vital Festival. We're backstage at Tennants Vital. This
is where the bands come to chill out. No sign of the Foo Fighters,
they are away on the other side of this backstage area. And there is a
special cordoned off tent. Of course, this is their first gig in
Northern Ireland. Some of you might remember at the early Nineties Mac
when Dave Grohl was here in Belfast with Nirvana. He has not been back
since but in two hours he will take to the stage with the Foo Fighters.
Earlier today, it was a local band based in Craigavon who opened the
entire event. They are Trucker Tom from Trucker tableau is with me.
How did you get involved? entered a competition about two
months ago. We were whittled down to the last 16. We went down and
play it, and we got the news about a month ago. It was unbelievable.
How did it feel? Unbelievable. Being on stage, supporting the Foo
Fighters, and remembering learning those songs years ago, it is a
dream come true. Fantastic. Stephen Rainey is with us. It is a great
news story for that band. What does it mean for other bands up and
coming in Northern Ireland? It is a rare opportunity to play in front
of a crowd like that. There are a lot of people out there. We have a
unique situation where local bands who are used to playing in pubs and
bars can get on a stage like that and bring their music to a huge
audience. If only a quarter of the people out there by 80 should, that
is an incredible success for a local band.    buy a Taoiseach.
Opportunities like this are essential for them. It is great for
local bands but tonight is all about the Foo Fighters. I am a huge
fan, and I am really excited. I have come prepared. I have got my
wellies the and I am ready to rock. Maybe her guests have seen a
Maybe her guests have seen a different forecast.
We have had a bit of everything today, to be fair. Heavy rain,
thunder, sunshine, lightning. What else could we have thrown at us?
Very good for those chasing storms. Our Twitter feed was really busier
earlier. Thank you for you're pictures and tweets. Only a brief
respite from thunder and lightning before the next area of heavy
showers moved in. Storms in Belfast. Sharp showers kicking around at the
moment, but they are easing away. Many of us of these black clouds
looming.    sort these black clouds. There was flooding briefly. That is
how the showers looked up a short time ago. They will be drying up
this evening. Most of the shares will become confined to the north
and west. They will be back tomorrow but not as ferocious as
they were. Because of the breeze, it will grow through swiftly.   
but in the east, the best of the temperatures because of the
westerly breeze. We're looking at 18 or 19 when the sun is out.
Further west, the showers will probably be more frequent.
Temperatures will be around 17 or 18. It may feel fresher compared to
recent days because of that breeze. The showers continuing to the end
of the afternoon. There will be a dry spell for a while tomorrow
night. The weather pattern is very unsettled at the moment. The next
area of low pressure is moving in from the Atlantic to bring wet and
windy weather through Thursday and Friday. Prepare yourself so for
more rain for the end of the week. more rain for the end of the week.
