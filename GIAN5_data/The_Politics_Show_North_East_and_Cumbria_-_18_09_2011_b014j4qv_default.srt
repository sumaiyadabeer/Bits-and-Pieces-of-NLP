Here, a Teesside MP blames councils for failing to support the region's
businesses. Should they be forced to buy local?
And a network of electricity pylons could soon be running through some
of the north's most beautiful landscapes. We report from Cumbria.
Hello and welcome to your local part of the show. I hope you
enjoyed the summer, what there was of it anyway. Thanks for tuning in
again. Coming up: In a week of grim
economic news, councils in the North East and Cumbria are accused
of giving too much work to businesses outside the region.
And I am in Cumbria, where a new network of pylons could be built
across some of the county's most beautiful landscape.
More from Emily in Cumbria later. And we will also be mulling over
what to make of the new political map of the north that has been
Hartlepool. First, the TUC has accused the
Government of bleeding the life out of the North East economy after the
region experienced another big rise in unemployment. Ministers say they
are doing their best to help the private sector create new jobs. But
what about our councils? Are they doing their bit? Well, the Politics
Show has asked all the big local authorities in Cumbria and the
North East how many contracts they are awarding to companies based in
the region. Here's our political correspondent, Mark Denten.
Kevin Brown is a happy man. After a few tough months, his company has
just landed some big orders. contracts are potentially worth
200,000. We finished in the last two weeks and �50,000 maintenance
project. The form got that new business from Hartlepool council.
It makes a point of buying local. We have in all our contracts
clauses that talk about local employment, apprenticeships from
the people from the borough and as a result of that, a lot of her
local businesses are being able to compete more. For every pound spent
with the local workforce, it comes back threefold. To but the by local
message does not seem to have got through to everyone. We have
discovered big variations in the amount that there councils spend in
the region. In Hartlepool, 62% of contracts are placed with North
East firms. In Newcastle, it is 51%. What is more concerning is that
some councils have reduced the amount their spending locally.
Redcar and Cleveland Council have seen a 17% drop in its North East
contracts. Won Redcar seafront, the place is buzzing with building work.
But large parts of this work went to companies based outside the
North East. The local MP is concerned. Keeping money in the
area which stimulates employment and other activity, is part of
their value that can be generated through these contracts. I think
they should look at this very closely. Clearly, the council
taxpayers want a good deal. Did you know what to pay over the lot for
services, but at the same time, they want their area to be
successful. An hour Adia, we want to restore the North East economy
and reduce unemployment. If but the council says that European
competition rules mean that it cannot just by local. With �17
million of council cuts around here, they say that Porter's expect the
best deal. I think people expect value for money, but the expect a
good job as well. There is no point in doing it cheaper if it is not
fit for purpose. It all comes for the tax system and the council
taxpayer pay for this. But some say the council could do much more.
This business used to supply for councils and the North East, but
all that business went to a firm in France. At the moment, what they
are doing now is having one supplier supplying the product.
Taking that out of the local economy creates a difficult
situation. The worst case scenario is that it puts a lead on the
growth prospects of companies in the North East. They might still
have opportunities to work as sub  contractors, but it will put a
ceiling on how far they are able to grow. That will have an impact on
the amount of wealthy can create and the jobs they can create.
The Chamber of Trade ending Mark's report. Well, with me in the studio
to discuss that are the Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick, Sir Alan
Beith and the Labour MP for Hartlepool, Iain Wright. Ian Wright,
your local council did well to us, but should the pressure to be the
lowest price or supporting local firms? I think councils can be big
economic players in the local region. I think they have to think
about the value for money. There is a balance to be struck, because it
is important to bleed    breathed life into the local economy. We
have had to work hard with contracts to make sure that their
local jobs and apprenticeship opportunities as well. Would you
say that other councils are not making the same effort? I think
that there can be big players in the local economy. Would you
criticise a country that did not reach that 62% level? In difficult
times, at a time when central government is slashing budgets for
local government, that will have an impact. Equally, in order to make
sure that we can maintain skills and have a good economy in their
region, councils can play a leading role there. Sir Alan Beith, is it
ever justifiable to pay a bit more to insure a contract stays local?
That is worth paying more to make sure that the job is done properly.
Quite often a local contractor can do that. One of your items in the
film demonstrated where the problems start from. It is these
big contracts that bundle up everything so that a whole range of
suppliers have to come through the one company. That is a get someone
to    someone coming to change a light bulb from the other end of
the country. We're all under that pressure, but that is what drives
out local businesses. One of the things that there tumbrel and do   
that in Northumberland are doing is contract to the small local firms
to do the work. There is a lot more scope for a smaller business if we
do not have such a huge bundle up contracts. Every penny extra that
the spend on these contracts, even it is laudable to look at other,
local companies, they have to look at council tax bills. The council  
  their tax payer expects local councils to be conscious of value
for money. In the end, I think we would all suffer if we did not have
proper competition and if we allowed companies to name their
price because they were the nearest company to the council headquarters.
We cannot run it like that. But we can organise it so that local
companies can bed successfully for contracts. What did he make of
councils like Gateshead or Cumbria that say they do not hold this
information? I think it is important that you have
transparency, so a local electorate can see what they council is
spending money on. In these difficult times, every penny that
every council spends is important. I would say for every penny or
pound that is spent by Hartlepool council, three or �4 can be pumped
back into the local economy. It can do a real job in regenerating the
town's economy. Let us talk about local economy. Sir Alan Beith, the
focus is on the desperate need for more jobs. You have the highest
unemployment rate in the contract. The North East is not doing well
out of this coalition. The way it has to the Ford is to increase
private sector jobs.    the way it has to move forward. These figures
show that the coalition's policy of encouraging private sector
employment is not doing enough. Private sector employment is
increasing across the country. not enough. Nobody thinks that it
will be at the speeds that is consistent. Ian Wright, some would
say that this is a Labour's legacy. The last government made their
council to dependent on spending. Prior to the last election, on
employment was coming down. It was all about pumping lot of
unsustainable government money into the region. It is more complex than
simply having private sector and public sector jobs over here. You
can see it councils can be enablers and facilitators of their local
government policy. This is feeling the whole country, but especially
the north east. But the solution is not for the government just to
spend more money, isn't it? want things like the jailing of the
   dualling of the A1. One a focus on investment in infrastructure is
the right way to goal.    go. government in power at the moment
will be subject to severe financial restraints. How long can be a keep
on going seeing those significant rising in employment in the North
East, before the strategy has to change? But you cannot go back to
policy on    of the borrowing in order to pay the current bills.
Nick Clegg was talking this week about making sure that public
sector contracts do not fall behind, so that we get the work in the
timescale that we need it. But the money is not there unless the go on
doing what we were doing before, which was borrowing money to pay
the bills.    unless we stop doing what we were doing before.
And if you go to my blog you can find out how your council spends
with businesses in the local area. That's bbc.co.uk/richardmoss.
Now, we have heard a lot from the Government about the need for new
nuclear power stations and wind farms to help generate energy in
the future. Sometimes they are not welcomed whole heartedly by local
communities. But the controversy does not end there. In Cumbria, the
energy generated from new reactors and wind farms will have to be
transferred to the national grid. As Emily Unia reports, that could
lead to a string of new giant pylons across one of Britain's most
beautiful landscapes. De is like this draw thousands of
visitors every year, so at any threat to their landscape is met
with a ferocious opposition. But there is another side to Cumbria,
the energy coast. Plans for a new nuclear power station, mean I knew
grid connection, transferring energy across the country. But
balancing development with protecting the environment is going
to be a challenge. Cumbria sees itself as a place where no    non 
carbon energy can be focused in the future. We're looking very
seriously at renewables, both onshore and offshore. All that
means a much more powerful grid connection. What we have to see is
an acceptable extension to the National Grid. In the heart of the
National Park, there is a feeling that the countryside is under
threat. I have no problem with them putting a connection in, my problem
is how they are going to do it, underground or overground. If you
look at it now, we have a few of the Lake District at its best today.
If that will be covered with pylons, up to 60 feet high, you can just
imagine what that will look like. It sickens me, to be honest. It is
something that cannot happen. I am in the North Pennines, an area of
outstanding national beauty.    natural beauty. Once the work has
been completed here in the putting connections underground. It will be
difficult to tell that there will be any cables here. But these
cables are very different are the ones that will be for the new
connection. Buddying them will be a much more expensive proposition. It
will likely effect energy prices. The National Grid does not have an
inherent preference for any technology. What is important to us
was that we get the right balance for the nation, that balances the
local impact with the cost to the consumer. Underground cables are
significantly more expensive. We know that underground cables
removed the visual impact. They are one of their technologies that we
will consider. As battle lines are drawn offer the prospect of more
and bigger pylons, their calls for a realistic conversation about the
options. How much is the public prepared to pay in order to save
the landscape, protect national parks and not live under national
pylons? At think the answer will have to be compromised. You can
bury some of it, but not all that. Some may areas are going to have to
except the fact, because it is just not affordable for everything to be
buried. It does not go to public consultation next year, but behind
the scenes, councils and campaigners are pushing for a
compromise. Meanwhile, become    the government is running a
competition to design a new kind of pylon, in the hope that we will all
grow to love them. Emily Unia reporting. Well, all
week, MPs like Penrith's Rory Stewart have been poring over the
details of their new constituency boundaries. Cumbria will lose one
seat, while the North East will lose three as part of David
Cameron's plan to reduce the number of MPs at the next general election.
It's a review that's thrown up some slightly quirky outcomes. Consett
and Barnard Castle, two towns with very little in common up to now,
find themselves in the same parliamentary seat. While, in
contrast, neighbouring Whitley Bay and Tynemouth will be represented
by two different MPs. So what are we to make of it all? And which
party stands to gain most from the changes? The region can manage with
for fewer MPs quite easily. I think those principles are correct. We
should try and cost the    cut down on the cost of politics. Your party
was our duty to keep these MPs. think to cut down the cost of
politics is the right approach. Let's be honest, this is
gerrymandering by the Tories and order to make sure that they are
locked in a majority. Whole legislative framework has been
trying to push an in built Tory majority in England in perpetuity.
I think it is all it and I think deceit that you highlighted is a
good example. On one hand, the MP would be representing Hadrian's
Wall or at the top and the Yorkshire Dales at the bottom. I do
not think the Boundary Commission have taken into account as much as
they should have done. There are some huge constituencies that have
been created. 2,500 square kilometres for Hexham. That will
not help MPs serve their constituencies better. Mine is the
third biggest in England at the moment. It can be done. Boundary
changes always create problems. I think it is quite wrong to suggest
that it is gerrymandering. This is nothing to do with the politicians.
It is just a coincidence that it advantages the Conservatives?
reason it advantages they Conservatives is because the
current system has been a bad the during labour.    giving an
Government. What I think they could do little more of us looking at
places where they might be splitting up a local communities
and see if they can, within the rules, match communities better.
Labour did very little about this, because it knew that it suited them.
It lost in seats and are Canadians, where people voted Labour. Those
principles, or tried to cut the cost of politics and equalise the
number of voters. You say that and then see it is gerrymandering. It
is political point scoring. It is not. I think the point is that at
the moment, the first draft of what the Boundary Commission has done
this week froze up a number of interesting and somewhat odd
connotations and they think people will be working to see if they can
improve that sense of community cohesion which should be part of
the parliamentary constituency. you think bet public opera about
this?    do you think that the public will care about this? It and
there will be some committee concerned, but generally people
want to see their MPs doing the job properly and well and they think we
spend enough on politics as it is. Thank you very much.
And if you go to my blog you can find more on the new look
constituencies. Why not post a comment and let us know what you
think about them? We're back next Sunday quite a bit
earlier, at 11am, when we will be asking what impact the Government's
changes to planning policy will have on the North East. In the
