will travel around the world. Has there ever been a more exciting
all controversial build up to the Masters tournament? This is the
first major tournament of the New Year and the new decade, and it has
following his stunning fall from grace last November. His is perhaps
the most scrutinised return to sport ever. People are curious, we
are all curious. Television ratings will be huge, just as they were on
Monday when he gave his first press conference after the scandal, which
erupted almost five months ago. A lot has happened in my life over
the past five months. I am here at the Masters tournament to compete.
I am excited about doing that. I didn't know what to expect with
regards to reception. But the gallery has knock    could not be
nicer. Encouragement I got, it blew me away. It really did. I know the
tell the players, hopefully after today, after I have answered
questions at his press conference, players can be left alone to focus
on the Masters and focus on their game. But also going forward. I
want to apologise to all of them are having to endure what they have
had to endure. I want to talk about the golf tournament, what I have to
do to prepare. No one wants to talk about how he is preparing. We have
to, it is part of it, we have to be patient. I feel like I have done a
good job. It was good to see him out here, it has been a while. We
all have our own thoughts on the situations. Personally, it is none
of my business and I have an event to prepare for. It is good for golf
he is back and hopefully we can I have missed the guys, it is great
being out here. Ken Brown was glued to that press
conference, several important points, first, drugs. He denied
ever taking performance enhancing drugs, but how important is this in
the whole story? I hope the has not taking it, there was always a bit
of chat he had taken something to improve his knee. I hope it goes
away, because he has had enough problems. The image of the squeaky 
clean family man has gone for ever. How drastic is the public's
realignment of their affections to have him back? The public will
still have the greatest player in the world. He has done some that
things, he has admitted to it. Tom Watson said some insignificant. He
wrote a letter to him before this happened. I have watched him
playing his practice rounds, smiling, tipping his hat. To be a
great player, you have to give something back to the game. He says
he is going to be a more muted player when he is losing command
when he is winning, give the game more respect. I think he craves the
respect of his fellow players now? He was worried he might get some
cheering from the crowd, he had no idea of the reaction he was going
to get from his fellow players. He looked totally relieved. He will be
very pleased it is all over. weeks out of the game, the
bookmakers have him as favourite. I know his mental strength his
legendary, but realistically, what can we hope from him? It is going
to be tough, he will be nervous and apprehensive. He will be full of,
let's get at it. His opening tee shot may fly over the opening
bunker. He will have a lot of things going through his mind.
sure every other player expects there are sideshows, but until play
gets under way tomorrow, the United Kingdom has 12 players. The Masters
is special. You just walk around here and the atmosphere it is
different. I have always been after this one, so that won't change.
is one of those golf courses that requires a lot of discipline. I am
trying to ease my way into the tournament and have a chance coming
into the back nine on Sunday. to make sure when you get to the
back nine on Sunday, you have not worn yourself out and you're ready
to play those nine holes. You have to make sure you don't put yourself
under too much stress early on in the event. I am as ready as I am
ever going to be. I have had two weeks off, done enough homework on
the golf course to understand it as much as I can. I want to do it
because I know you'll get others who will break through and maybe
beat me to it. There are lots of other guys, lots of guys this week
who are capable. You would like a green jacket? I would like a green
jacket. What size are you? 42 long. Padraig Harrington may be at 42
long, Ernie Els is 46 long. He is the hot property in golf at the
moment? He must be the most confident player coming into the
event. He is playing well and putting well. He looks to be
comfortable hitting a draw shot, which is a shot required at the
Augusta Masters. How confident do you feel about the UK challenge?
Three Englishmen in the top 10 in the world at the moment. Paul Casey
has had an injury, but has come back well. Playing confidently. Lee
Westwood, third in his last two majors, so he has confidence. Ian
Poulter is probably the best putter Poulter is probably the best putter
at the moment. And the guy from Northern Ireland, Rory McIlroy and
MacDowell. They make Tiger Woods the favourite, despite not playing
for five months. Phil Mickelson, twice the winner here. Ernie Els
after back to back wins on the PGA Championship Tour. Lee Westwood,
Championship Tour. Lee Westwood, the world number four.
It is time to find out the important question, who are you
getting on this year? With Tiger Woods's performance unpredictable,
I'm going to go with Paul Casey. He is full of confidence. What about
you? I am flying the flag for the United Kingdom players, hoping Ian
Poulter will do it. If I was putting money on it, I would go for
a Atif Goosen or Ernie Els. I don't know who your money is on, but
whoever it is, it will be a ride over the next four days. Ken Brown
will be in the commentary box and will be in the commentary box and
in the studio with me. These other groupings we will be watching from
tomorrow morning. These times are five hours ahead. It is the 1991
last year, and he is still going at You will be able to see Tiger Woods
tee off alive with us on the red button and on the news channel.
General Election permitting! If you cannot wait until then, you can of
course go online. On the red button it you will be able to see the
coverage beginning. We are under way for real at 9pm on BBC Two and
of course on the page deep channel. Tiger Woods will be on about the
8th hole by then. Let's hope the class of 2010 providers with as
much excitement as we saw last year. 12 months ago, the officials
decided they would give us one of the kindest and most gentle us
cause set ups in recent years. Consequently, the old Sunday magic
returned. Cheering and shouting all around the course as those putts
went in. Quite an atmosphere. Let's show with you once again, the
concluding moments of last year's Masters. This is how the green
jacket was won. No one has meant more to the great game of goals
than armoury starter this morning. A fierce competitor and his love
around the world. The man who has been the face of golf a round the
world for the last 50 years. Ladies and other man, joined me in
welcoming for times Masters champion, Mr Arnold Palmer. Arnold,

Player walking on to the first tee to begin his 52nd and final Masters.
And then, not only making birdie at two, but a great par saved at the
year. The young guys have a lot to look forward to in the future.
Mickelson was not happy with his game on Thursday, with this one
I played terrible, but the golf course was there for the taking.
The greens were receptive, which allow guys to attack and keep the
ball around the pin. There are low rounds out there if you play well.
round 70. This Texan did something on Thursday that had never been
done at the Masters. A birdie on the first hole, off this brilliant
approach. Two more at two and three, and two more at four and five. The
best start in Masters history, topping the four made by this
amateur player in 1956 when he finished runner up. Campbell's tee
shot at 12 began another streak of After setting up this birdie at 15.
Before two closing bogeys brought him in it with the day's best 65.
How p with the round, a bit upset with that finish, but have we get
that tomorrow and keep it going. There were four birdies in a row
starting here at the 14th hole. he opened at one stroke behind
United States Open last year, Tiger Woods had reconstructive surgery on
his left knee and did not played for 18 months. Now, he picks up his
first birdie of the day at the 9th hole. He putts for another at one.
Mack    at 14. And he lines up his second shot at the 15th. Try ing to
cut it in and he does not hit it. He makes birdie to go 3 under par
and has a chance to go 4 under at 17. And at 18, this chip leads to a
closing bogey. And he shoots 70. just did not get it done.
players broke 70 in round one. Angel Cabrera birdied all fives.
Tiger Woods had an opening 70 for the 4th time at the Masters, he won
after winning as a rookie in 1979, his skills are still sharp on the
par three. And then the tears come at the 18th green. I was doing
pretty good until the 18th hole. I had a few moments out there, but 18
broken down, but it is a great feeling. Campbell goes out in 33.
Including this birdie. And when he makes another at 10, he has built a
five stroke lead, but it does not last. He makes three bogeys coming
in, while his good friend plays a mistake free round of 67. And he
ties the lead. If I got a shot to say aye am top of the lead of the
Masters, I have never been able to say that before. Tiger Woods, even
par for the day. He gets to 3 under for the tournament, but no lower.
And then he bogeys 18 for the second day in a row. And seven
strokes back. A lot of wasted opportunities today, did not get
round. Phil Mickelson saves on the opening par. And then he turns
things around on the second nine. Including an eagle here at 13. He
played the last seven holes in 5  under. A I am six back of a lot of
players, I have to play a good round and shoot something in the
60s to have a chance on Sunday, and I welcome the challenge. Angel
Cabrera is moving up the leaderboard. He is known for his
power, but a short game is on display as he nearly makes eagle at
13. And he closes with a birdie at 18. And a second straight round of
68, one of the lead. This was a Masters record, 11 birdies in round
two, including that 13. He said, I felt like I could have made a
couple more. He closed with a birdie at 18. And this was a
scorecard he might want to frame. Six birdies on the first nine, five
on the second, and a 65. Gusting winds in the afternoon lead to a
penalty for Padraig Harrington, he has a birdie putt at 15, but his
birdie    but his ball moves and that cost him a stroke. He shoot   
he shoots at 73. Greg Norman at 12. But that is his final highlight and
he misses the court by two. 50 players make it to the weekend.
Kim's 65 was the low round of the day by two. The defending champion
his 10 back. Rory McIlroy is the only teenager to make the court.
Amateur Steve Wilson and almost eagle ever made. This amateur also
made history at 11. A two on the par Macro    on the par four! And
he added another eagle at 18. But none of the amateurs made the one 
over par cut. On Friday afternoon, Gary player brought a 52 years and
   brought a 52 year Masters history to a close with style. And
human!    cue! And Respect. And And by the defending champion, and
other South African golfers in the Masters field. And then he greeted
his family. And then he shed his heart. This has been an absolute
privilege, and an honour. And the people I have met have been
battles and I would like to say that if they have the golf course
in heaven, I am sure this is what it will look quite.    what it will
look like. Saturday, a late morning and early afternoon start for the
field and the patrons., a little early and you can get to the front
row of the putting green to see Tiger would. You can head out on
the course and take in the early eagle and then made birdie. Now at
six. A shot that tells the story of shoot 70 to get a 4 under. Kenny
Perry at 10. He takes the outright lead with a birdie and a round of
70. Phil Mickelson, even on his round. Two putt for birdie at 13.
He makes this long putt forerunner that 15. And he is tied with Tiger.
This Japanese player at one. Mack     at 14. He plays the contours of
the green to near perfection and is tied for 6th. This at 15. Eagles,
4th place. Campbell in the bunker above the hole at 16. He makes
double bogey and drops to third place. Angel Cabrera makes a late
afternoon move. And he birdies here at 15. Four and again at 17. He
ties with Paris. I have to keep it going, keep doing the same thing
they have been doing, and I will do my job tomorrow and I think the
others will be even more nervous. It would be a big test tomorrow, I
am looking forward to the challenge and seeing what I have got. For I
do not get this opportunity, this may be my last time to have this
kind of opportunities. One round to go, eight tied for the lead, and
Tiger and America will each be looking to make up the points. They
are paired together for the first time since the final round in 2001.
But Tiger's warm up has not gone well and included this stumble on
his way from the range. One of the lowest moment I had was this
morning. And that was one of the worst tee shot I had. The ball
landed near the eight fairway and he was able to save par. There are
teeing off a full hour before the leaders on another day with good
conditions for scoring. Phil Mickelson birdies two at three and
three strokes from the lead and three ahead of Tiger Woods. At
seven, his drive has missed The Fairway. But it doesn't matter...
The 7th green and the second green sits side by side and as Phil
Mickelson walks up seven, of the leaders, now at two, can see as
well as here the challenge he is mounting. Tiger with a long putt
for birdie. That roar of disappointment. Backed Kenny Perry
of his own birdie putt. And he settled for par. Phil Mickelson
made his 5th birdie and was two out Now trails by one. Tiger, six
behind. Attacks the par five. It is a blind shot, and it sets up an
eagle putt. Angel Cabrera for a birdie at 3. Takes the lead. Tiger
for an eagle. Five strokes behind. And that Raul was still in the air
as Angel Cabrera hit his tee shot at four. The 232 yard par three. It
landed in a bunker and he bogeyed. Phil Mickelson for a birdie at
eight. Played his last six holes in 18 strokes. At five, Jim Furyk,
tied with Tiger Woods. Gets to eight under par. Phil Mickelson
pars and nine and ties the course record with the first 930. He is
tied for third, one stroke behind co leaders, Kenny Perry and Angel
Cabrera. At seven, Chad Campbell to tie the lead. Phil Mickelson still
one back as he arrives at the 12th tee. Kenny Perry's approach at
seven. Angel Cabrera made bogey at five and now Perry has a chance for
two stroke lead. I pushed it off to the right and missed it. Campbell
at 8. Is now tied for the lead. Campbell is the Red The Lebanon
eight. The 12 hole today is 150 yards, Phil Mickelson has a 99.   
nine iron. That was a terrible swing at to so many good shots. To
miss it that far right was costly. He made double bogey. 27 year old
John Merrick playing his first Masters put together a streak of
four birdies on the second nine, highlighted by this tee shot at 16.
And his 66 was a low round of the day and tied for 6th place.
Campbell in trouble off the tee at nine. Bogey eight and fell out of
the lead. Jim Furyk also in trouble at nine. Made double bogey and
would finish in a tie for 10th. Nine holes left in this Masters,
and 48 year old Kenny Perry, who could become the oldest winner in
tournament history has a one stroke lead. Tiger and Phil Mickelson both
thinking eagle as they hit tee shots on the par five, 15th. At 12,
former Open champion, Todd Hamilton put his tee shot in the water and
hit his third from the drop area. And that got him into the top 16
and an invitation for next year. Chad Campbell missed another
fairway at 11. And made another for right there. Flag height, a
little right to left and a great chance for eagle. Just to the right
edge of what is an Eastern white pine. Shouldn't be too difficult.
187 yards. Both of those will work. Tiger will be putting to get within
one of the lead. Phil Mickelson it will be putting to tie. Get ready
to put your fingers in your ears if this goes in. It stayed up. He is
not going to believe that. Phil Mickelson on the same line is
confused by Tiger Woods's putt. Hours looking at the putt and was
committed and then I saw his ball go up there and steered to the
right of the hole. So we look at it again and thought, this could go
right. Not even close. I did not trust my Reid, I did not commit to
it, I made a terrible stroke. birdie, and Phil Mickelson again is
one stroke behind Perry. He and Tiger Woods move up to the 16th tee.
165 yards. Now watch the backspin. He has a history at this hole, does
Augusta. Along the length of the pond at 16, on Sunday. Great shot
for Chad Campbell. After the bogey at 11, he needed to right the ship.
He is two back off Kenny Perry. So much can happen at this corner.
at 11. He thought he had its! He back. I was in awe of what they
were doing in front of me. I saw him go 10 under, and I thought they
must be having a lot of fun up there. I knew I was far enough
ahead of them, they would have to do something spectacular to catch
me. I had birdie holes coming up. This for two. That found the centre
of the cup and Chad Campbell moves to 10 under. Tiger at 17. It was
just a little bit off to the right at 17. This is a huge shot for the
leader, Kenny Perry. Just a smooth eight iron and not a bad shot at
all. Save shots, that is where you have to aim if you are protecting
good! And Chad Campbell makes birdie, Perry makes one right on
will have a great look and a chance to tie. Tiger trying to save par at
17. It was a difficult shot, maybe not that difficult. He did not play
three birdies in four holes. A bogey at the often overlooked 17th
hole. Phil Mickelson for a birdie. Again,
15 and 17, unbelievable. Chad Angel Cabrera is two over on his
thought it was good, his caddy told him it was short. Kenny Perry, for
eagle at 13. I could not believe how fast that put was! Angel
Cabrera for eagle. He would make birdie. Kenny Perry. That really
hurt! Phil Mickelson, his chances all but gone to save par at 18. Out
chance? And not right now, I thought if I could go under par
back nine, I could shoot under par, I could have a chance and get to 13
or 14. But these guys are too good. I am not going to leave, but these
guys are pretty good! I hit bad today. First of all, I was hitting
into the fairway, it was one of the worst tee shot I had hit starting
out. There would be no more roars from her    from five holes in
front. These players all in the final pairings. Still long shot
hopes here. And a birdie at 16 got him there 9 under par.    got him a
9 under par. And under a wonderful shot, and this time, that is up the
hill    another wonderful shot. He can take a real run at that. He was
putting for the outright lead. A birdie. Kenny Perry, now tied with
Campbell at 15. He told his caddy he had enough of it to clear the
pond, and he set up a long eagle tested again. A birdie, and for the
Campbell, to regain tied the lead. And    to regain tied the lead. And
Kenny Perry took a long look at the He gets a little help from the
slope and ends up 18 ft away. Walking after it! The shot of his
life! And I hit it and took off after it, I was working    I was
walking behind it because I knew I had hit it perfect and I knew it
would end up in that slot and the crowd would go crazy. Angel Cabrera
for birdie. An unbelievable putt, that was a key moment for him.
I still have a good chance, two holes left. Kenny Perry had a two
stroke lead with two holes to play. At 18, he about to the patrons and
putted for birdie.    he bowed. And it went over, so that was a little
disappointing. He played a bump and run shot for his third. Of this is
not good, it is downhill! That is a very poor chip shot. Were I get
nervous, my right hand wants to shoot eight    wants to shoot a bit
and I cannot commit down. I wish I had just hit a spinner instead of a
bump and run which usually gets me into trouble. A little uphill and
then slightly downhill, and that is well played! A lovely touch. Kenny
Perry made bogey, the lead was down to one with one hole to play.
Campbell at 18, putting to tie. His wife, Amy. Campbell finished at 12 
under par and one stroke behind, but a leader still had the play of
the 18th. Angel Cabrera also one back. He missed short and right,
leaving a relatively easy pitch. Kenny Perry, the first fairway
bunker at 18. He hooked his approach. Off and he missed on the
short side of the hole! Interested spectators included Campbell. And
Kenny Perry pars my wife, Sandy. He faced a difficult up and down.
misses, he has a chance to make their. There is it possible three 
way playoff. Kenny Perry to win the Masters. I had that putt on 18 that
I have seen taker    that I have seen Tiger make, I knew what it was
an that was probably the most disappointing of the day because I
hit it too easy. You have to give it a ride. Campbell was now in a
playoff, but could Angel Cabrera join him? The first three man play 
off at the Masters since 1987. Kenny Perry bogeyed the last two
holes in a round of 71. A South American has never won the Masters.
The playoff began on the 18th hole. And Angel Cabrera was in trouble
into the fairway. Kenny Perry's approach. He has got away with it!
That bunker would have been scary! It did not want to go left on the
last minute and I blocked it to the right, it was horrible!
You have got a decisive advantage. Angel Cabrera it is given new life
here. If he could just land this past the flag. He here it comes!
I was lucky I got they've    I was lucky I got a good line, I still
got a chance to make a four    to make a four. It is fabulous, he
will love it! He wanted a little more out of it. That is the chip
shot I used on the 71st hole. Beautiful! I gave it a good role
and it was 3 ft. A Angel Cabrera up for par.    Angel Cabrera for par.
Feet he at least two men would go to a second play off hole    at
headed to the 10th hole. I missed a lot of opportunities, but I take a
lot of positives. I played well all week. I definitely feel good about
it. I am a little upset right now, but I will take a lot of positives
   a lot of positives from it. Kenny Perry in the fairway at 10.
When it was going left, I thought, brave shot! Kenny Perry are again
would miss the putt for par. And 39 year old Angel Cabrera had won
was proud the way I hung in there. I may never get this opportunity
again, but I had a lot of fun, it was a blast to fight with them. I
did not get it done, I lost the tournament, but Angel Cabrera
Hunkin, I was proud. He made three birdies in the last six holes and
an amazing six par save on the first hole. For always at this
stage of the tournament, any player who does not feel nervous is not
human. I was relaxed, I was enjoying it and happy with what I
was doing it. This is the Masters, you can do a lot of birdies and
