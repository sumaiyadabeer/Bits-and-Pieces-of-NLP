  Ready, Gnasher?
  Yes, yes!
  Let's go!
Is highly overrated
Unstoppable, unstoppable, yeah
They can't hold us back
We'll make the most of every second
Unstoppable, unstoppable, yeah
After all is said and done
Shout one for all and all for one
Open up your eyes, the world outside is waiting.
Come on, let's go!
  Wa hay, woo hoo!
  Wa hay!
Are you sure we should chuck away the detention book, Dennis?
Of course! If Mrs Creecher hasn't got it,
she won't know when we're in detention.
And I'm in for the rest of the year.
Yeah, but we're not.
What are you boys doing? You know you're not allowed here.
Sorry, Mrs Creecher, we were just looking for...erm...
my old skateboard, weren't we, Pie Face?
Yeah.
Here we are.
Heh heh!
Now, pay attention.
Here's an important message from the mayor.
Good morning, class.
I am pleased to announce that Beanotown School
has been chosen to test a new administration system.
No more wasteful paper, everything's been computerised.
But remember, it's vital that you follow the computer's instructions
to the letter.
Here's my new laptop, excellent!
This memory stick holds all the information you need.
Diaries, timetables, records, everything.
Now all the info has been transferred to your laptop.
Amazing!
Now all we have to do is consult the computer
to see what we're doing next.
There, you're all set.
Thank you.
Did he say,
"EVERY bit of information's in the stick", Mrs Creecher?
Yes, Dennis, including all your detentions.
Plus a new one for mucking about by the bin this morning.
Oh! Not fair.
And Curly and Pie Face will be joining you.
Uh!
Nice one, Dennis(!)
All afternoon in detention, thanks to you.
At least you're not stuck in there forever, like I am.
Hey!
This is the memory stick that guy had.
  He must have dropped it.
  So?
So maybe we should take a little trip to the computer room.
  Wow!
How wicked is that?
It's the master programme for Mrs Creecher's new system.
Does that mean you can delete it?
Don't be daft.
Why delete it when you can change it?
It's time school was fun!
Settle down, please.
Let's see what's in store for us, today.
I think it's our history test this morning, Mrs Creecher.
Oh, it's been cancelled.
That's appalling, Mrs Creecher.
Walter, you heard what the mayor said.
We must follow the computer's instructions exactly.
Now, what else has changed?
Oh, all detentions cancelled.
Pies and ice cream for lunch.
Oh ho! And there's a new rule that says,
"Pets can come to school."
Waagh!
So... What is our first lesson, Mrs Creecher?
It's, erm...
Drum and bass studies.
Oh!
Ha, nice one, Dennis.
Yeah, even Mrs Creecher's enjoying herself.
Oh, this is outrageous. The school's going to the dogs.
Mrs Creecher!
Oh, come on, Walter, don't be a square!
Wo oh oh!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
What's next, Mrs Creecher?
Erm...
Go kart racing?
Yeah!
I don't remember ordering all these cars.
Oh, hello, that new computer system.
Are you sure you installed it correctly?
Everything's...different.
Well, it will seem different for a while.
Don't worry, just do what it says. It is foolproof.
Come on, Mrs Creecher, you're missing all the fun.
Mrs Creecher, you have to stop this at once.
She's doing what the mayor says, Walter.
I think you're just trying to get her into trouble!
Walter, I'm surprised at you.
Oh! Right, I'm going after them.
Waaagh!
Wo oh!
Yee ha! Woh ho ho ho!
Race you, Mrs Creecher.
Oh, ho ho ho!
Wo oh!
  Oh!
  Waaay!
Waaagh!
  Oh!
  Lunchtime!
Hmm!
Where have I seen this before?
So this is what Dennis has been doing.
How utterly vile.
  Let's give it back right away.
  No.
It's up to us to save the school.
In fact...
this is our chance to make it the school we've always dreamed of.
This is amazing, Dennis.
I never thought I'd wake up looking forward to school.
  Eh?
Next.
  Thank you, Walter. Next.
Hah! Can't wait for Dennis' turn.
Why can't Gnasher come in?
Oh, they've changed the rules again.
So send him home and get changed out of those ridiculous clothes.
Hide somewhere.
And now, hand over those sweets.
  Genius, Walter.
  Hah, this is only the beginning.
Someone's changed the computer programme again.
Where's the memory stick?
I don't know.
It must have fallen out of my pocket in the car race.
Right, settle down, please.
So today we have the history test we didn't have yesterday.
Then maths, flower arranging
and experimental jazz appreciation.
And what's for lunch, Mrs Creecher?
Erm... Lettuce and seaweed soup,
Eugh!
Oh, and Dennis...
all your detentions are back again.
Right, I should have known.
I can't take much more of this.
We have to get the memory stick back from Walter.
And now, one of my favourites.
Everybody out.
Waaagh!
Now's our chance.
Right, Walter, hand it over.
Catch, Bertie!
Oh!
Dudley!
Oh... Oh! Walter!
Oh, no, it's gone in the soup.
Leave it, it's mine.
In your dreams, Walter.
Waaagh!
What are you boys doing in here?
Waaaagh!
Waaaagh!
Look on the bright side, at least we got rid of Walter's system.
Please, Mrs Creecher.
No, Walter, we're going back to the old ways and that's it.
Quite right, Mrs Creecher.
And, as for this... I know exactly what I'm going to do with it.
Dennis!
