Hello and welcome to the banks of the River Strule in at Omagh for
the latest of our series of The Politics Show election specials. A
beautiful location in the heart of County Tyrone, but two Rees ago
this town was witness to the murder of Constable Ronin Kerr. Today, we
are talking to the biggest parties about their vision for the future
of Northern Ireland and asking if it is time to change the way
This is the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh, a ï¿½10 million complex
featuring a theatre, and it arts centre and a gallery space. Part of
its mission is to make quality arts performances available to the
public. Last night played host to the touring production of Give My
Head Peace. We are hoping to equal the quality of that production.
They are Sinn Fein's John O'Dowd, Arlene Foster, Basil McCrea of the
Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP's Conal McDevitt. They will be
I'll make an assumption that you all want your party to be top dog
after this election, but why does it matter who holds the post of
First Minister, Deputy First Minister or joint first minister?
Arlene Foster. As a Unionist, I want to see a Unionist first
minister. It is about all the other jobs in the Executive, as well.
Whoever gets the most seats gets the most power. That is what is
most important. We have a vision for Northern Ireland and we want to
get the maximum number of seats to do that. I have already said that
it is not just about the first minister. This is the fascination
with the media about this First Minister verses Deputy First
Minister. I am more interested in the 60,000 people who do not have a
job, rather than the one job of the first minister. There is a real
need for us to get those issues dealt with in the Executive.
that your party's position? I thought you were concerned about
the threat of Sinn Fein holding the post. Now you say it you're not
worried about it. It was not us to raise the issue. It was the media.
As a Unionist, I want to see Peter Robinson returned as the first
minister. I believe he will be. Then we will see how many seats we
get so that we can see how many other ministers we get. Basil
McCrea, you are happy for Martin McGuinness to hold the post. Is
that unusual? That is not quite what we have said. I have to agree
with Arlene on the point that the real issue is about jobs, education.
When you look at the two positions of the Deputy Minister and First
Minister, they are equal. Most people realise that we have to find
a way of working together. Would you favour a change in the titles?
It is a nonentity of a question. Which why have a difference if
there isn't one? There was a reason at the time. We have now moved on
to a more mature type of politics. People expect politicians to read
together collaboratively. They realise that if we do not do that,
we will all be losers.    work together collaboratively. The
questions on the doorstep are about jobs. But should you now suggest
that the first and Deputy First Ministers' titles be changed to
reflect what you have just said? think the debate on the names is
completely sterile. It is a white elephant and it is a relevant.
People are not talking to us about it and it is not something I want
to talk about. We will deal with issues that matter to people.
McDevitt, you negotiated these titles are in your party. Why did
you negotiate different titles if there is no difference between the
positions? The SDLP wanted to call it the giant office of the first
ministers.    joint office. We were not able to convince people that it
was useful. We are meant to have moved on. 12 years have passed and
we have seen historic milestones. Every party represented here today
has played their part in reaching those milestones. Let's call a
spade a spade. Let's call our joint first minister has joined First
Ministers. We should not just be talking about a greater partnership
but actually proving that there is a greater partnership. John O'Dowd,
let's be clear on Sinn Fein's position. What have you pledged to
do about this? Martin McGuinness has said that he is willing to have
a poster title of joint First Minister. It is not the most
important issue in the campaign because as everybody knows, it is a
joint First Minister role and Martin McGuinness and Peter
Robinson r = M that post.    are equal in it that post. We are
making progress towards equality in this society and there may be an
argument for Trent titles. But what is important is that we have seen
over the last few years that the posts have been working as joint
post so. But despite their differences, the ministers have
been able to work together for the betterment of society. You are all
almost singing from the same hymn sheet on that. We are in Omagh,
where the terrible murder of a policeman took place a few weeks
ago. Your party has criticised a request for extra time to pursue
suspects in that case. Does that not undermine the Chief Constable?
Know. What we have to do is ensure that the role of politicians... The
legislation that has been used was introduced in relation to Islamic
extremists. I don't think it reflects that when people are
arrested they can be held for 28 days. Are you suggesting that if
the suspects IN question was related to a particular type of
Islamic terrorism, it would be OK? Certainly not. The British
government came forward with reasons, saying that given the
nature of Islamic extremism, it is across the world. The groups have a
network across the world. Seven days was an abuse of the system. To
hold someone for 28 days is an abuse of the system. We are calling
for people to bring forward information about Constable Kerr's
murder. That is a firm determination from Sinn Fein to see
the people who are guilty of this murder brought before the court.
Basil McCrea, you said    sit on the Human Rights Committee of the
policing Board. The rights apply to everyone, whether you like them are
not. Do you support Sinn Fein's concerns? I am passionate about
human rights but I think John and his party misunderstands how they
were played in this context. The whole idea of human rights is that
you try to get justice for everybody. It is entirely
appropriate, or whether police can make a case to say that they need
more time and a judge agrees with them, that they are allowed more
time. The real issue is that Constable Kerr has human rights and
his family have human rights. We have to do it in a proper way.
There has been progress in the people understanding that if you do
things properly, you get the right results. This comment seems to have
been misunderstood by people. We have to work together to understand
that we are trying to do good for everybody. Human rights is a
framework for doing good, as long as it is not abused. There were
other regimes throughout the world that used to hold people for years
and you never got a trial. That was an abuse of human rights, but that
is not what we are talking about. We are talking about a defined
period of time, with judicial review, to do the right thing and
bring murderers to justice. SDLP styles itself as a pro human
rights party. Do you have concerns? We do not want to politicise
policing in this region. The policing Board exists to provide n
accountability mechanism for policing. I will be guided by them
on this issue and many. Do you mean Sinn Fein and a police spokesman
can't address and it    express an opinion? Yes, but I would not
expect colleagues of mine to express an argument that would give
rise to people... People who do not want to see the murderers of
Constable care brought to justice. I do not want to give rise to the
argument that could divide us.    Constable Kerr. We have to give a
political response, as well as a security response. There are many
young women who are, for ever were    whatever reason, feeling
inclined to align themselves with dissident republicanism. We need to
engage them and that is where we need to be putting our efforts.
Arlene Foster, does this give you any concerns about Sinn Fein in
terms of their support for the police, or do you recognise it as
what they say it is? The important issue for us on the devolution of
policing and justice was that the operational integrity of the chief
constable was kept independent of political interference. Therefore,
Sinn Fein can say what they like in relation to their concerns but the
decision is for the chief constable and the Chief Constable alone.
Basil is right that there is a judicial overview of the 28 days.
That is the critical difference, because time and time again, the
police will have to bring the case back to the court to make sure they
are complying with human rights law, and that is what they are doing.
Were you surprised by this? It is disappointing that Sinn Fein should
try to make politics out of something that is well above
politics. I think the whole community was heartened by the fact
that right across the political world, there was condemnation of a
horrific tragedy   for the family of Constable Kerr and his police
colleagues and for the whole community. Is it the case that you
now stand isolated on this is you? You express your views on your own
reasons, but that unity of parties that we have seen is perhaps
fragmented? Let's be careful and look at the broader principles,
rather than the individual cases. 28 days is the longest detention
period in any Western European country. I think politicians and
the media have a role to play in holding the agencies of government
to account. We cannot shirk away from responsibility, despite the
absence of others. We should not say that if we criticise the place
or the method, we are giving succour to the people involved in
the murder of Constable Kerr. There should be radical voices in the
media and I think the chief constable does need to be
challenged if the situation is right to be challenged over. There
are ways and means of having this debate. Let's have those debate in
private, amongst ourselves, put out press releases and engaging a
megaphone policy gives rise to people who do not share our, a
desire to unite against what is happening. It gives them succour.
Are we saying that the people who killed Constable Kerr had the
ability to stop political debate? That is a dangerous road to go down.
They had an impact on political debate. Your party had to amend its
party political broadcasts to amend this    to refer to this murder.
don't think we are wrong. We have seen that all the political parties
involved in the process have a skewed tear up    issued terrorism.
   eschewed terrorism. We were right to MN our broadcast, but also
to say that it will not stop us taking Northern Ireland forward. We
wanted to say that we are moving forward and that is the agenda.
will pause there for a moment. That is what the politicians here safe,
but let's find out what are the big issues that are affecting people on
What is the one question you would want our politicians to answer?
will they get people back to work in this country? Why are they
messing up the education system so badly? You think it is in a mess?
It yes, pretty bad. I had a lot of international friends when I was at
secondary school and a lot of them would say that they came to
Northern Ireland for the education system, rather than England, and
now they are copying the English system, which was deeply flawed.
think the division in our society, beyond all other things. It is the
division in Northern Ireland society. It needs to be eradicated
somehow. When are they going to sort the economy at? More jobs?
Make financial matters more stable and easier for people to manage?
Rural community transport. I am heading home on a one hour journey
down to the coast. Taking does that of the city centre and moving them
down. Pensions for women. They have been caught up in the 64 and 66
That is what people as saying out on the street. Let's hear from our
panel. You add the editor of the local paper. Has society in
Northern Ireland move forward to the extent a country that might
just a unionist or Socialist Party in a coalition? I think we are
premature on that. The next four Rea's would be the acid test. We
have had a lot of getting to know each other. People are looking for
delivery. There is no way of getting delivery for Northern
Ireland without working co  operatively. There are politicians
who have come forward that have established relationships. The more
people see that work, the more people and have confidence in the
government was that we don't get it right in the next a mandate, we
could have serious problems. Does that mean that by the time the next
mandate is that, people will be voting to what a different system
that may indeed include a voluntary coalition? We would be very keen on
seeing opposition. Like all politicians we are not volunteering
to be the opposition but we do recognise that in any democracy the
electorate needs to have a choice. There is something in that than are
we at one in three countries in the democratic world that does not have
an opposition. It will come, it will have to come. There will be
voluntary coalition and that will be a challenge for some parties but
it will not be a challenge for us. Is voluntary coalition inevitable?
People are saying that politics is not working. This is the old debate
about the trays person who blames their tools. I would rather see the
next generation coming into the Assembly committed to a partnership
with and genuinely working co  operatively to avoid the message we
have seen in education, avoid the crisis. Are you wedded to the
structures because you were a key in negotiating them's surely the
whole essence of the Good Friday in agreement was that it would be
transitional. We want to make Northern Ireland work for everyone.
There is no reason why the structures can't work perfectly
well. If the politicians who inhabit them come with a spirit of
partnership, it is not that the structure has been changed to it...
Was due think of that? What is your sense? I think we have made great
progress in the last number of years. Prevalence still exists in
Northern Ireland. I think people are more concerned about our
politicians are working to was fixing their issues, hospitals,
health and infrastructure. A you think a voluntary coalition will
help? I think it is a bit too soon. People would still fear that a
return to one party domination instalment might be very good care
and rivers of    instalments. petition of concern arises where by
30 signatures can call for a cross  community vote on any sort of
legislation. If you have 30 signatures you can give it to the
Speaker and that means a majority of Unionists and Socialists have to
support that piece of legislation. We are the party of reform since
1998. We have been calling for reform and we believe there are too
many members and there is a need for people to bring down the size
of government. You're willing to use that. It can be used by other
parties. It is a mechanism and we used that mechanism. Are you saying
that we should not use the mechanisms available to us? We
should look at moving to a majority in the Assembly. We are looking to
move forward in relation to reform, we believe there is a great deal to
be done. Stability has been brought to Northern Ireland over the last
four years. We need to look at the reforms. There has to be a report
brought by 2015 in relation to those reforms. Are you willing to
countenance change? We will examine all structures involving ourselves
in the review. In response to the question, the answer is, no. When I
hear some parties talking about coalition, what they're saying is
how they can not have Sinn Fein involved. The politics of exclusion
does not work. On the question is politics working, I think politics
is working. It can be frustration and at times it does not always
deliver. Turnout at election is up. It an oxymoron. People are bored
with politics. We're in a system where it does not grab the
headlines. That does not mean politics is not working. It is a
difficult course to follow. It is difficult for politics at Assembly
level to deliver the needs of the individual. Are you in favour of
opposition in the south. That is why Gerry Adams stood up. Do you
think we should have an opposition in Stormont. When would you see it
coming in? We have the mandatory coalition but that does that mean
every party was entitled to it goes for it. If a party makes a decision
not to go to government that is their decision.
Is the Assembly ready for an opposition? People think it is and
at calling for an overhaul. They have been deadlocked over major
issues. Yvette to has been looking What these boys learn on the field
at Belfast Institute will take them through life and could serve them
well if they fancy a career in Here is the first lesson. You have
to keep possession of the ball and not give any ground to the
opposition. And that's pretty much what's been
happening at Stormont as parties tussle for supremacy on key issues.
Some political experts say that while mandatory coalition helped
peace building, it's now become a hindrance to progress. The problem
now is as hard decisions need to be taken the parties find themselves
pulled in different directions in order to address the needs of the
their own constituents, or their own communities. This creates a
problem where a lot of important policies are basically kicked to
touch and no decisions are taken on them.
At this hustings event at Queen's, it was clear that young voters
wanted to see a review of Stormont structures.
It is impossible to get their minister who is poor at their job
and see them resigned or displaced or replaced by someone else because
of the system we have got. It is frustrating to see Northern Ireland
stuck in the loop over and over. How do you break out of that? It
does not look as if it is going to happen, not at this election.
Devolution has the potential to deliver more to people on the
ground and that has not been happening in the Assembly because
of the deadlocks we have been experiencing. We are readying   
arguing for a coalition. It would allow flexible power sharing and
they agreed opposition which will be able to challenge the government.
The last four years for politicians who are in government for the first
time, there is a degree of coming together and growing and learning
and evolving. Next time around there should be more maturity and
more thinking really together rather than thinking as individual
parties. When an issue's been kicked into
touch, as frequently happens at Stormont, politicians need to get
it back into play. It's time for another lesson from the rugby field.
In the line out I know what is going to happen, I threw the ball
down the middle and hopefully our team will win possession.
There are various proposals for breaking what critics see as a
recipe for deadlock in the Executive. Some want to see a
return to the drawing board and the creation of a formal opposition.
Here's an idea that could change the game, after the election.
Parties going into that decision making process make a decision as
to if they are going to take part in the Executive or whether they
are not going to take their seats at the Executive table. We could
form an informal or a formal opposition in the Assembly to the
Executive. There is an opportunity for the new Assembly to experiment
with the new way of governing. Throughout the peace process
politicians have had to negotiate their way around serious obstacles.
The aim is the game is to score a try at the end of the pitch. You
have to play as a team. Barry Turley and Alex Kane have
always been opposites. They worked as advisers to the SDLP and Ulster
Unionists when the parties were involved in drawing up the Assembly
structures. Today they take opposing views on the question of
whether or not Stormont is ready for voluntary coalition and a
formal opposition. I almost voted against the Belfast
Agreement in 1990 it because I was concerned about the lack of
accountability, the lack of opposition. If you don't have an
opposition offering alternatives and who are there to scrutinise and
say, holding that the Government to account, what is the point of
having a government? It is not democracy. Isn't that the point of
the committee system? To make sure that no minister runs off the
reservation to far. The it only works if you have 100 of the 108
members represented. How do they scrutinised because they are all
part of the same package it? That would suggest we have a normal
government for a normal society. We are far from being a normal society.
There is still a huge healing process. While the structures are
there to govern and have done, as some people would say, a
questionable job of that in the last four years I have issues about
that assessment. There is a situation also that the Executive,
the Assembly and all the bodies laid out under the Good Friday
Agreement are there to bind the wounds of this society and we are
not there yet. You have got to... When are you going to be there?
Euell weeks away from the 4th election to this Assembly and
people say it is a sign. At what stage do you say we are mature
enough and strong enough to have contrary views? They are almost
afraid of opposition. It is very well to say that as an academic
argument. How do organise one party goes into opposition other than if
they don't get enough seats to get a ministry. I would say it would be
a brave leader who would say on a principle, he will lead the party
into opposition. Here's one leader who's not afraid
of opposition, he says its exactly what the Assembly needs to function
more effectively. We should be the same as anywhere
else in the world. Every party goes to the polls, no party is big
enough to form a government on their own. Those who can agree,
whoever they may be, for the government. They    those who can't,
form the opposition. There are some major issues to be
sorted out after this election   issues that should have been
resolved during the last Assembly. Will we see more agreement around
the executive table? Or will parties continue to pull in
Let's go back to our panel and a I must student as a part time
college and also will mother. What advice would to the panel give to
students considering embarking on a third level education at the moment,
considering the financial challenges? My advice would be to
change    take this election very seriously, because the way you vote
will determine whether you are going to be properly supported
during the next four years. I started a campaign against the
increasing student fees and my party continued it. We need a new
budget after this election, which puts higher education whether it
deserves to be   as a key driver of economy   and which sees Third
Level students, whether they are part time or full time, as engines
for our recovery in economic terms. My best advice to students would be
to read the manifesto is carefully, look at the record and vote for a
party that has been capable of opposing the old budget, and vote
for one bad will demand a new budget to support students. Basil
McCrea, your minister could have indicated what the Executive could
do but instead he put matters out to consultation. Why was he hedging
his bets? There is a discussion to be had with everybody in the
Executive about way to spend the money. Our preferred position is
that there are no fees, but there is a cost to that which means that
we will have to find ï¿½40 million and we have to agree where we take
it from. You said no fees. Do you mean no increase in fees? We would
prefer no fees. We had various proposals cost about as to what
might happen. We are adamant that the best way forward for any young
people who ask for some advice, getting better skills, better
education, going forward, is inevitably the right choice for the
rest of your life. There are certain issues and you have to
decide which jobs you are going to apply for. There are a huge
shortage in ICT and technology, cultural tourism. You have to be
careful... It is my position that in every walk of life, the more
skilled you are, the more trained you are, the better qualifications
you have, the better of the contribution to society and the
better the amount of money you earn. The executive's says it has put the
economy as its biggest priority. How beget a signal could there be
than saying, university education is free for all. We have but is at
the heart of our budget. Those departments that got eight the cash
increase were the key departments. They bring the economy forward.
not enough money in the employment and learning budget to ensure that
they do not raised these? There is a consultation out, as you have
already heard. From our perspective, we do not want any rise in fees. We
believe it is wrong and we need to allow every student, regardless of
background, access to higher education. But it is right that we
need to look at that particular sectors in Northern Ireland where
there are gaps. Basil was right in relation to information technology
and all those high technology jobs   we need to see more people coming
forward. There are conversion courses at    courses are available
and we have the skills and the talent in Northern Ireland to bring
more investment into Northern Ireland. We need the students there
to have those skills to develop them. John O'Dowd, whereas the
radical thinking? We have had a full term of this Assembly and
people will congratulate you on that. But we now have a situation
where fees may have to go up and there are other threats to the
economy. Whereas the radical thinking that might have prevented
that? My concern with the debate of the media is, why should they
arise? I think that if it came from the Dail committee, if they were to
look at their budgets in a different way, we could have kept
student fees where they are now. Sinn Fein will say that if it comes
across the Executive table, Sinn Fein will be blocking any rise in
student fees. When Conal McDevitt talks about students are studying
manifestos very carefully, it was the SDLP who introduced student
fees. No, it was not. It is in their political DNA. He was the
minister when fees came in but it was not his decision. Did he not
have the authority over it? fact of the matter is that that
policy change has led to have more than a doubling in participation in
statistics for people from social economic backgrounds participating
in higher education. The higher up    the question is whether we want
to build on that or whether we are going to allow bad budgeting to
screw us over. Ministers will use the same arguments   that they did
not introduce the fees... It is an entirely different argument. The
argument in the early 1990s was about a fundamental reform of
Further and Higher Education. This is political and that a regional
level. Tell us where you would cut   would you cut investments are the
universities? There is a lot to be done with universities. Exactly how
they spend the millions of pounds that is going through the Budget,
in terms of where they are using the Investment opportunities.
you cut the investments, they will no longer be leading universities
and they these will go down. Ministers are making hard decisions.
I believe the Executive it should be going in and going through the
budgets of every university to see where there is money to be spared.
He got an extra ï¿½50 million as a result of the draft budget
consultation. The next question is from Mary, a community worker.
Communities are coming under more pressure and some of the peace
funding has been cut. What does your party plan to do to address
this? Piece funding is another thing that is going. European
grants will no longer be given to businesses and a couple of years'
time. What will he be doing? It is one of the things I have been
spending a lot of time doing   trying to get the most out of our
European money. In terms of development and research, we could
do a lot more, but in relation to the peace money   which has had a
big impact across Northern Ireland over the past few years   the first
minister and the Deputy First Minister had a meeting with the
President of the European Commission to see if there was a
way we could have a programme to sustain the piece that had been
brought about, and the stability there we have. Does to be clear  
to the third phase is in progress. Will the European Commission
countenance of all the funding package? This is what we are
looking for. We are looking at different ways of delivering it
because we believe that this will be the very last time we have this
sort of programme. If we are able to achieve it, it must have real
and lasting benefit for the communities into which the money
goes. That is augmented by the Social Investment Fund and the
social protection fund. The Social Investment Fund also deals with the
last question. We need to deal with working class areas, particularly
working class boys who do not have the aspiration to move into higher
education. There has been ï¿½20 million set aside to deal with
those problems. Basil McCrea, your party is not a fan of the fund. Why
are you against it? We are concerned that there is no real
accountability about it. There will be a cut in funding and there are a
lot of people doing a lot of good work. I think the biggest tragedy
for any of the organisations in that area is that they are forever
looking for more funding. The is that not the danger with all of
this kind of    kind of funding? Of people become dependent? It is the
fact that there is no certainty. No sooner have you got some funding,
you have to start asking for more. Some people are not able to do the
work that needs to be done. I do think there is an issue about how
we deal with things in the future. There will be a time when we do not
get more money from Europe and we do have to set aside budgets within
our own bigger budgets. If you do not tackle these issues of
education    educational under  achievement of social cohesion, we
are not going to fix Northern Ireland for the future. You have to
did collectively and I think we will. Conal McDevitt, community
infrastructure is going to be lacking in funds in coming years.
What can replace a? We need to be honest with the community and
voluntary sector about the fact that many will not continue to flow.
There are things we could be doing that we have not in the past four
years. A lot of the community sector is capable of becoming a
social economy. There are many community services that are
providing essential services to the community. They are involved in
recycling and other environment managing services. We should
encourage them to become social enterprises. Won't that see civil
servants lose their jobs in the mainstream public sector? We will
see better public services as a result. We will see them delivered
at community level by members of the community. They will be much
more responsive than big civil services. We meet it says the way
we do our budgeting. We cannot cut their community relations budget
and still talk about improving community relations. We can't cut
the recycling budget and Belfast and 98%   that is cutting the knees
offer voluntary and community organisations involved in that
sector. It prevents them from becoming what they could be, which
is sustainable community businesses. John O'Dowd, how hopeful are you
that the European Commission will fund more peace money? I don't
think we should build up expectations. In the next four
years, I think we need to plant more of a foothold in Brussels and
Europe to ensure that we have a direct connection. There is already
an office there. It is only half a dozen staff. I am saying that, from
a ministerial level downwards, we have to start thinking about what
is happening in Europe and how we can access more money. Mary, what
you think? I am delighted to hear that ï¿½20 million has been set as
its    set aside each year for the next four years. Another question.
Marcus is a businessman. What is your concern? As a businessman, I
am concerned about large infrastructure projects. I feel
there is a direct correlation between development of
infrastructure and economic prosperity. We are against this
because we are seeing capital budgets cut by 40% over the next
few years. It is not a question of not wanting to do things   it is a
question of foreign to make choices and decisions. Even went there are
hundreds of millions on offer from the Irish government? It is about
where you put your money. Unfortunately, there is a choice
coming and there is no way of getting around this. We would like
to do everything. Is it just about protecting the rural vote? Farmers
who are angry about their field being divided? No, it is not the
case. There is no doubt that the business of government is building
infrastructure. But whenever you are building new hospitals, part of
what you are looking at is what the road infrastructure is like to get
people there. Everything is connected. You cannot make
decisions in isolation. You need a coherent, cogent argument about
where you should go forward. Unfortunately and regrettably, we
are going to see cuts in the money available to make investment
decisions and as a businessman, I am quite sure that people looked at
that and say that we should have a discussion. We have put forward our
particular position but there are discussions to be had. Conal
McDevitt, could it be better spent? I think the a Hawkwood Road five
should proceed.    the AA Hawkwood Road 5.    the AA 5. The big thing
that we need to talk about is the strategic investment needs. That is
why we have proposed a 25 year contract with the British
government. We need to start shifting our conversation with the
UK. We need to support those keep things that we need to build out.
We need to enter into a formal deal with them. It will lower our
dependency. We could bring in lower taxation and low rates of VAT for
businesses, which also lower our dependency. What we need in return
is a certainty that our big ticket items, which will address 40 years
of underfunding in roads and other infrastructure, can go ahead and
that is the conversation we want to have with the Treasury. John O'Dowd,
you see big projects and some be the one man to go ahead while
others don't. When you do cut the budget and they are slashing
spending across the board, we will not see too many of those in the
future. Marcus is worried that The A5 is an economic initiative.
The West has been discriminated against for generations. I think we
have to modernise the infrastructure across the west of
Ireland to allow businesses to expand their operations and open up
tourism and other measures that the East has had for so long. The A5 is
not simply a road project, it is uneconomic project. A event with a
neurone budget, when you look at what happens to capital spending
after three years it is down to practical    practically nothing.
Projects like that drive the economy and they won't be many of
those in a few years' time. Employed we did make economic
investment.    I am glad. Going forward, we have a 40% cut that has
been visited upon us by the Westminster government. We are part
of the United Kingdom so I take objection to that. I have a
contract with our governments and other people of Northern Ireland
decide otherwise. That is what matters to me. We need to look at
doing things in a different way. There is opportunities now in the
new administration to look a third party developments, building
infrastructure in a different way and working with the private sector.
Do you have any PFI schemes? I am talking about doing things in a
different way. There are messages we can take an work forward on a
plaque    capital programme. It will have to be done in a different
way. A you have looked at the figures and see how things are
headed. Are you concerned there is a lack of imagination? We have to
think about things more imaginatively and shocked about
Basil's comment. Do have the opportunity of ï¿½400 million
contribution will never be seen again. I am wondering about a
financial prudence. A Y ï¿½400 million was sent back to Dublin?
have to spend money ourselves and there are other projects we can
look at. Let's say it was around I c to, our vision.    I ACT. The
real issue for Northern Ireland is the cost of energy. We have a huge
tidal streams around our coast and we should be leading the way on
that. The Irish government isn't offering any money and that? It is
not taking about    it is not about taking a short term gain. We have
to build a Northern Ireland of the future who will pay its own way. It
will be based on film industries, creative industries. That is why
you elect people to make decisions on. We will come back to the
economy shortly. My question is about to obesity. It
costs 500 Met    ï¿½500 million a year to us. Given this enormous
financial and human cost what you think your party will do to tackle
it? It is about looking at health right across the government and
that is what the sports minister has been doing with his
announcement of investment in major sport here. He would be saying that
the made    the way to deal with obesity is to get young people out
are running around the sports fields. The is that the case, he
did not prioritise the elite sporting venues. That is a misnomer.
If you look at the package for football for example, it has been
spread that right across Northern Ireland and is going from one that
would one end to the other. It is going right across Northern Ireland.
It is not going to elite sports, it is going right across. The simple
fact is it is about exercise and diet. A lot of it happens early on
in life. We talk about early years education, you look at the number
of children who were coming in cool are obese. Once you get into that
cycle it is hard to deal with it. All of the real advances in health
come from public health initiatives. That is how you make the way
forward. If you an obese, you do have a problem. There is a problem
with how politicians leading by example. You can't lecture at
people. Are you suggesting a collective diet? We have lost
pounds walking on the streets. We can't just lecture people, we have
to lead people and show them what to the    to do was up smoking is
an issue as well. Do you think they should be leading by example?
Politicians are in a great example to give subtle and consistent
signals to the population that is not about the elite sport and Top
End. It is about the routine and day to day life. Can you walk
safely along the streets? I wish all of you are lucky in that
endeavour. No doubt you will tell us about your cycling better at
Stormont. What about policy? cycled home with me one night last
year and he is doing his best for the press corps. If you look at our
budget, we are spending 1.6% of our health budget in public health in
preventative work. We are making a manifesto commitment that says we
will increase that to 4% by 2050. That will cause a lot of issues in
other parts of the health service but we need to set those targets.
We are saying we will take it to the average of 7% by 2020. That is
where we need to be talking. We need to be putting figures on this.
Obesity or heart disease or some of the others chronic diseases we have
embedded in our society at the consequence of poor public health.
That is where we need to be focusing our attention. On the big
issues on theirs, we follow the lead set by Westminster or anywhere
else. Why can't Northern Ireland have its own unique    unique way
to tackle this? We have a health strategy. It was the most radical
document. Do you think people he would know about that? You have to
put it in the centre of the Executive table. I see this as a
health facility, this art centre of a. It is clear that health messages
are not getting through particularly those people on low
incomes. We have to send messages to people on low incomes. There are
food on the market they can buy a which are cheap and good for their
help. That message has to be put across to people. A what about the
regulation? In terms of advertisements for children, I
think we should be looking at how some fast foods advertised. When
you look at the detrimental impact it is having a people's health,
legislation and taxation is the way forward. Many thanks. Let's get our
final question. The people using your facility, I getting healthy.
given that tourism is the new growth industry in Northern Ireland,
what will the panel do to help tourism providers to make us more
competitive? You have to pay rates like any other business. You don't
think that is recognised. You think these guys can do something about
that. Everybody has to do their bit. The local councillors at taking
extortionist rates from us.    extortion at. What is to be done?
One of the key issues was the fragmentation of tourism provision
and what we needed to do was bring together all of the tourism
providers so we can protect their to the world what we have to offer
in Northern Ireland. Over the next few years, Northern Ireland has a
great story to sell in relation to tourism. Do you think it is more
than other businesses? Should they be given an exception I pass on
rates? We have been putting a lot of capital investment into tourism
over the past number of years to try and help tourism for it to come
to a level that it wasn't able to come during the days of the
Troubles. We array low rates party.    we are a. There was a need for
us to help businesses who are struggling. It is a challenging
time. If there are ways we can help, the key to this is to listen to
what people want us to do. We had them at a manufacturing rates. We
have a low rates party. It is about choices and the Assembly chooses
now it    not to charge people for water. It does not seem to care or
mind when businesses are struggling to pay their rates. Why not be
brave about it and introduce water charges? I wonder when at the
magical water charges would arise. A further levy on people would
somehow raised that the economy, according to some. A lot of
tourists come from abroad. That is good for the economy. I am not
suggesting tourism is not good for the economy. You have to look at
taxation on businesses but you also have to look at investment. Always
cutting taxation is and always the answer. Always a rising taxation is
not always the answer. There is an opportunity for the tourism sector
to engage with politicians to look for the long term best way forward.
One of the reasons the SDLP has been campaigning follow corporation
tax is that we believe certain business taxes, if kept low, will
stimulate the economy. There was an interesting measure taken in the
last budget on the retail side having highest taxes and lower
rates for town centre retailers. That is a model we should look get.
If we are seeing is a prioritising tourism, we have to look at ways to
incentive eyes tourism growth. It is the export opportunity we need
to see. It is being able to look at businesses as a net exporter.
McCrea, you can't be all things to all men but there are tough choices.
Are you willing to benefit businesses? It was me that led the
campaign to cap industrial D rating. It was with other people that went
off and said if they put taxes up you will lose jobs. When it comes
to others, I see the economic argument that says if you go for
that, you have to encourage it. If you're going to reduce taxes you
have to put them up somewhere else. That is decision making. We will
see what happens in the next Monday's. That is it from us for
