Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Shooting Stars.
Yes... And I must say I'm compelled
Yes, I'm just making a frittata of wool, eggs, teeth and a banana, Vic.
  Well, give us a bit.
  No, for example, no.
  No, for example, yes. Give us some.
  All right, here you are.
I've been walking so long
Walking these streets Looking for love
He's looking for a man He's looking for a girl
He don't care cos he's bisexual.
My frittata, Vic!
It's not often I make a frittata
  and it attaches itself to a face.
  And it scurried away.
It scurried away to the Northwest, perhaps on its way to... Doesn't matter.
Doesn't really matter, does it?
  Does it matter? It doesn't matter.
  Doesn't really matter.
Now, ladies and gentlemen at home, you may notice I'm wearing the jeggings
because it's International Jeggings Evening.
  International Jeggings Day!
  There's somebody missing.
  Who could it be?
Someone to keep the scores for you   it's Angelos Epithemiou!
She call me Mr Boombastic Say me fantastic
Touch me on me butt
She says I'm Mr Ro...Romantic
Call me fantastic
Touch me on me butt
She says I'm Mr Ro...mantic
Smooth just like silk
Soft and cuddly Hug me up like a quilt...
Good morning to you, Angelos.
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
Have you got some good noises for us today?
Yeah, I've got a few lined up for you today.
WHISTLE And that's just an example.
So where do you get all your stuff for your pound shop, Angelos?
Well, because it's all rubbish, I get it from abroad.
Right.
So have you actually ever been abroad?
Yeah, I've been abroad. I went abroad earlier on in the year.
I went to Greece to see my brother, but I went on a boat
because of the environment, thank you.
I went on a boat because I will not fly, no.
What were you doing over there?
I was working at his tyre incineration factory.
It's lovely to see our teams here. Team B, thank you all for coming.
James Buckley from The Inbetweeners.
  I like your fringe, James.
  Yeah, thanks.
  That's the kitchen scissors fringe.
  All right, don't have a pop at it.
  It's very medieval.
  All right!
In fact, seeing you with you James   apologies, James  
there's quite a medieval vibe coming from over there.
It's a look, isn't it?
James looks like a knight or earl of something, and you look like...
something below a yeoman. What would that be, Vic?
You know your history, what's beneath...?
A peasant?
  A peasant.
James, in The Inbetweeners, a fantastic show,
it's at school and you represent the gang
that's in between the cool kids, like me,
and the dickheads like Vic, yeah?
  Yeah.
  Hey!
  What?
  I wasn't...a dickhead.
I was THE dickhead.
He was THE dickhead, can you imagine?
  Do you want a question, James?
  Go for it.
True or false, James May?
  True or false?
  False.
False. Well, let's find out. Might you, James?
  No.
  You never would?
  Never.
  You tried it and never again?
No.
And you said false, so it's a correct answer, then,
supplied by the man himself, Mr James May.
  Louie!
  Yes?
Now then, Louie...
Oh, shit!
  Never mind that.
  Angelos!
I am sorry. I am sorry.
It can happen from time to time, Louie.
Louie, now some of your dance moves must put
TREMENDOUS strain on your cobblers.
Slightly.
They must be under TREMENDOUS physical pressure.
Y Y Y Yes.
  Would you like a QUESTION, Louie?
  Ooooh, please.
Louie Spence, true or false   Stevie Wonder has recently found out
that he's wasted millions of dollars on a cure for blondeness.
True.
It's true! Well done, Louie.
Well done, Louie.
Hi, Ulrika.
  Hi, Bob.
  Hi there.
  Ulrika ka ka
She's a Swedish OAP Ulrika ka ka
When she laughs she has a wee.
  Ulrika ka ka ka ka.
Ulrika, I'm not going to make you drink a pint,
but given your advanced years,
I'm wondering if you're willing to drink a pint of Horlicks in less than ten seconds.
  Are you willing to take that challenge?
It's Jeggings Night, remember...
  What?
  Nice approach.
Jeggings, je je je je jeggings...
Ulrika, you've got ten seconds, are you ready?
Do I have to stand up?
Yeah, it's nicer if you stand up, then we see your boobies.
So you've got ten seconds, Ulrika, are you ready?
Starting from now.
  Yes!
Not half!
  Well done, how many seconds was that?
  It was six, wasn't it, Angelos?
Six seconds. But just so you know, when you drink it at night,
you don't have to drink a pint in six seconds.
You can take your time with it, it's not, you know, urrr...
  Well done, Ulrika!
Jack, with your face like a jar of tinned trout...
Like a soft boiled fart...
With your face like braised matter.
  Look at him!
  Vic?
Yes.
Vic, could you not say something nice
  about Jack's face for once?
  I suppose I could try.
It would make a change, wouldn't it, to say something nice about him?
Every week you're just abusive.
All right, then, yes. Jack, with your face like a newly born kitten
  with a winning pools coupon.
  Do you know what, Vic?
I don't like it, actually. I think I'd go back to normal.
  Really?
  Yes, to be honest.
It doesn't feel right,
it's like being groomed on the Internet or something.
You've come over a bit sort of greasy.
Jack, with your face like a two shilling hand job.
  Do you want to keep your hat on, Jack?
  He likes it.
Who put it on me, was it you?
  I'm styling.
  It's lovely.
We thought we'd camp this side up a little bit.
I mean, you need it, what with Louie being there, don't you?
Yeah.
Jack, take a look at this picture and tell me, who is Hitler?
Who is Hitler?
  This is, um...
  It's hard, isn't it?
It is, hard, yeah. It's meant to be hard.
  Do you know who that is?
  No.
  I haven't got a clue.
  Any idea?
You don't know, do you? The answer is...
  him. James May.
  I was going to say, is it you?
Oh, it's James May.
  Who did you think it was, James?
  David Cameron.
You thought David Cameron. That's always a popular choice.
  James, thanks for coming.
  A pleasure.
Looking you up on Wikipedia, it said that your catchphrase is, "Oh, cock."
  Is that right?
  Yes, sort of.
Well, it's interesting, because we looked up Louie as well,
and his catchphrase was, "Oh, cock."
My ears pricked up!
  Have a question, James. Yeah?
  Yes, please.
Would you like that? Here it comes.
True or false   David Dick in son?
True.
Well, I can't possibly comment, I reckon it's false.
Paloma!
  Una Paloma Blanca.
Ahhh!
  Got a bag of tomatoes
I put my face in the tomatoes
Bring my face out of the tomatoes
And put it back in
And out, and in and out, and in.
  You and me, Paloma. You and me.
  Is that your kind of guy?
Um, it's alternative, to the usual sort of roses or a teddy holding
  a heart with a stupid message.
  Yeah, Teddy Boys.
Ten out of ten for effort.
Thank you so much, and same to you with Mickey Mouse,
who's buried in your head.
Paloma, could you tell me, what is Bob opening?
A jar of...
..gherkins.
You reckon it's a jar of gherkins. Is it?
The top's not off, is it?
Well, I've loosened it, haven't I?
What is it?
Oh! Sorry, it's onions  
pickled onions.
She's right, it's pickled onions, well done!
  Is she right?
  It is onions.
You have a smell.
Yeah, it's onions.
  Do you want a smell, James?
  Let him have a whiff.
There. Just take the top off.
It's onions, all right.
  It is onions.
  I'll just put that down.
  Was that it?
  That was it.
  Did she get it right?
  That was the question. She got it right!
Well done, Paloma!
That's the end of round one, so what are the scores, Angelos?
  Angelos!
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

Jack's got two and Ulrika's got three.
Well done, Ulrika.
Oh, yes.

Hey!
Next round is the Clips Round.
I am going to ask both teams to watch the clip on their monitors.
Watch carefully, cos the question follows.
It's MasterChef featuring Peter Kay.
So, Peter Kay,
  lovely to have you on the show.
  Same.
So, Peter, tell us, what's on the menu today?
Clackers. Who remembers clackers?
That was a lovely playground favourite.
Do you remember the Aztec bar?
A Steakhouse grill, who remembers that?
Norman, you remember the Steakhouse grill, don't you?
There's always a Norman, isn't there?
Always somewhere there's a Norman. You remember Norman churches?
Yeah, but, Peter, what's on the menu?
They were good, weren't they, Norman churches?
There was lovely architecture round the doorway.
  Those are very good memories.
  Who remembers old fashioned trousers?
Do you remember in t'olden days when we used to wear old fashioned trousers?
Do you remember that? You do, don't you?
Look, these are fabulous memories, Peter, but what's on your menu?
Do you remember Puffalumps? Remember paraffin lamps,
that was an old fashioned style of heating, wasn't it?
Do you remember asbestos?
That was very difficult to remove from your roofing cavities, wasn't it?
Do you remember Panda Pops?
Do you remember donkey jackets with the leather panel on t'back?
We've all enjoyed the memories, Peter.
You've enjoyed listening to me memories, haven't you? Do you remember Dirty Den?
Stop living in the past, Peter! Move on!
Do you remember blunderbusses? An old fashioned type of weaponry,
  wasn't it?
You've enjoyed having me here.
Grrrr, what are you? A friggin' historian! Grrrr!
Why are you reminding people of these things?
Remember arsenic? That was an old fashioned...
Leg warmers! James Hunt! Gandhi! Krakatoa! Bastards! Ring tones!
Peter Kay there,
reminding people of things they'd previously known but forgotten
that they were aware of any more.
And I'll ask Team B first   it featured a werewolf, that clip,
which is a man...
It featured a werewolf,
which, of course, is a man turning into a wolf on a full moon.
But can you tell me what some men turn into on a half moon?
A were.
A were?
We're going with the were.
Team A?
  I reckon it must be a why wolf.
  A why wolf?
It's like a wolf, but with no point to him.
  What's the answer?
  Well, I'm afraid neither are right,
because on a half moon, some men turn into a fox.
And on a quarter moon, a sausage dog.
That's the end of the Clips Round, so what are the scores...
...Angelos?
You don't want to ask what's in me bag?
  Not yet.
  Not yet, no.
OK, sorry about that.
James May!
  Hello.
  Hi.
That Top Gear thing is like Last Of The Summer Wine now, innit, with you...?
Yep.
Hey, with your burger van, I forgot to ask...
That's gone.
Yeah, but what about insurance, that sort of thing?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Got the insurance money, that's come through.
  How much did you get?
  Nice one.
  It was a nice one, yes. Yes.
Spent it on something good,
something what I needed, something very important, thank you.
  New burger van?
  No.
  A deposit on a flat?
  No. No, no.
A tusk.
Three grand on a tusk? Yes, three grand.
It's an investment, innit?
Because everyone is bang into elephants now.
Detail there   they're mucking about in the woods. You can't see that.
But what are the scores, Angelos?
  'One, two two...seven, eight...one hundred and two.'
  Angelos! What have Team A got?
  'One.'
  No, they haven't, they had two.
  'Two.'
  What have Team B got?
  'F Four, three.'
Thank you, Angelos.
Next round is the Dove From Above round. I'd like all the players to assist me
in beckoning down that beautiful, plump Dove From Above.
  And surely she will come.
Down comes that wonderful dove. Come on down, and let's make love.
Louie, would you care to pick a category from the flange of the dove?
I wouldn't normally go as close to the flange, but...
  ..I think I'll go for Go.
  Go? Very well.
That's Angelos's Variety Showcase. Have a look at this.
Angelos is going to present us with some fantastic show biz turn.
  Watch carefully, the question follows.
  Nice jeggings, Ange.
  Thank you, it's National Jeggings Day.
  I know that.
Muh muh muh poker face Muh muh poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my

She's got to love nobody
Muh muh muh poker face Muh muh poker face
Muh muh muh poker face Muh muh poker face
Muh muh muh poker face Muh muh poker face
Muh muh muh poker face Muh muh poker face!
All right!
Louie, that was a fantastic dance, I'm sure you'll agree.
No, it was, it was phenomenal.
I'll give you a point if you can better that dance.
I don't know if I can... I mean...
  If you can better it...
  Come on, get out here.
If you can top Angelos, you get the points.
Two, one, go!
Wey!
  Thank you, Louie!
  Thank you, Louie.
  So...
  I really don't know which was best.
We'd better ask Angelos. It's for you to judge it, Angelos.
Who was the best, you or Louie?
Me. He's a clown.
  Sorry, Louie.
  I'll let him have that one.
  Louie?
  Yes, darling.
I have seen you on that programme what you do,
with your top off and all your muscles out, and all that stuff.
You must pull the birds like there's no tomorrow.
Like you wouldn't believe.
  Well done, anyway, Louie.
  Cheers, man.
Next, I'm going to ask James   would you pick a category from the Dove From Above?
Um, er, Listen.
Good question. It's a celebrity duo
who are going to ask you a question. If you look at your monitor there.
Listen carefully, they give you the question. It's Kajagoogoo.
Hi, I'm Limahl. I'm currently struggling to find stage work in the Skipton area.
I'm Nick Beggs, and I'm currently working for Dyno Rod.
Ask them the question, Nick.
Well, I work for Dyno Rod, but what do I specialise in?
Is it hand rodding, blockage prevention or water jetting?
A, B or C, as it were, James?
Hand rodding...water jetting or blockage prevention?
He said "blockage prevention" very enthusiastically.
Maybe you've seen something there.
I'll go for the blockage one.
Blockage? Let's find out.
So, what's the answer, Nick?
The answer is all three, although I do enjoy hand rodding the most.
I can vouch for that.
Give over, you daft ha'p'orth.
  Hand rodding.
  Hand rodding.
  Hand rodding.
Have you used the services of Dyno Rod, James, or are you not a homeowner?
I've not...
I'm afraid not.
James, do you use Dyno Rod, or have you got someone who phones Dyno Rod for you?
I have a man who phones Dyno Rod from me when I need some hand rodding.
We all need a bit of hand rodding now and then.
I've got them on speed dial!
Well, now then, Paloma, would you like to select a category
from the side of the dove?
Listen 2.
  Listen 2.
  Listen 2.
  It's the club singer question.
  That a good choice, Paloma.
Mr Reeves is going to sing a song
  in the club style.
  Hello.
  There's Mr Reeves, there.
  Hello.
Listen carefully.
You have to identify what song it is he's singing. Are you ready, Angelos?
What was it?
Any ideas what that song was, Paloma?
It's a traditional song.
  Yeah, he was definitely singing.
  I'm answering this one. You...
Oo oo ooh!
Ohh ohh ohh!
O o oh!
  I'm answering this one!
Um, Candi Staton  
I'd Rather Be An Old Man's Sweetheart Than To Be A Young Man's Fool.
How on Earth did she get that...wrong?
  Wrong!
  What was it, Vic?
  It was Pop Goes The Weasel.
  Oh, as if!
Let's hear that song sung properly, in the jazz style
of the Cecil Airline Jazz Reproduction Orchestra. Here we go...
Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Mix it up and make it nice
Pop goes the weasel.
Pop goes that weasel.
Well, that's the end of the Dove From Above round,
so let's find out what are the scores.
But, perhaps more importantly, let's find out what's in Angelos's bag.
What's in your bag, Angelos?
Tell us what is in your bag
You bastard
A plastic pen and a cigarette
And a lump of the Internet.
  Thank you, Angelos.
  That's what's in there.
Jack, am I coming home with you tonight?
Er, I can give you a lift, but you're not coming back to my house.
I'll give you a lift. I'll drop you off near your shop.
Excuse me?
I said, you're not coming back to my house...
Uhhhh...excuse me?
  I said...
  I'm sorry!
  I'll give you a lift back to...
  Yeah...ohhh...
I'll drop you off near your shop, you're not coming back to my house.
Yeah, do what you like.
You can stop at mine, Angelos.
Not interested.
Louie's? Stop at Louie's?
Yes, that could be fun.
I'm up for it.
Mmm. I'm sure YOU are(!)
  What are the scores, Angelos?
  Jack's got two, Ulrika's got five.
Next round is Quick fire round, we're against the clock.
When the time is up, you will hear this noise.
Chicken.
We're against the clock. On your buzzers, so I really want to see those fingers.
Nice bit of finger in there, Louie, thank you for that.
Off you go, Vic, we're against the clock.
True or false   Spartacus was a gobshite.
  That's James.
  False.
  It's true.
  Oh!
Name an ingredient of pea soup.
  That is Louie.
  Pea.
  No, urine.
John Lennon and Paul...?
  Ulrika?
  Gascoigne.
  Correct!
Well done.
Name a junction on the M6, south of Birmingham.
  Ulrika?
No. Ooh, so close. 2A. New one.
  Chicken.
  Oh!
That's the end of the Quick fire round.
So, Angelos, what are the final scores?
  Ulrika is this week's winner.
  I'll bet she is.
Ulrika, you're tonight's winning captain,
so would you like to select a member of your team
to take tonight's final challenge?
Er, I think it has to be Mr May.
Are you willing to take the challenge, James?
Yeah, all right.
  Thank you, James!
James, come and join us centre stage as we play Trampolina.
James, if you'd like to join us centre stage...
Now, the first thing we'd like is an air bed, please. If we could have an air bed.
  If you could fetch that, Mr Reeves...
  There it is, the air bed!
James, you're going to be under no pressure here, there's nothing violent,
nothing painful or whatever,
but could I first of all ask you to lay down, with your head at that end?
And Mr Reeves will give you details
of the incredible prize you can win this evening.
And James, it is an incredible prize. Vic...
Tonight's prize for you is this beautiful...camel...
Where's the camel gone?
James, you've won this fantastic rope.
It's still worth winning.
Now, let me introduce you to Trampo. His real name is Cecil Airline.
  Here's Cecil.
Now, Cecil is going to introduce you to the joys of his beard.
Now, if you can take those joys and those scents
for the period of time of the competition, you win the rope.
When the time is up, you'll hear this noise.
Can you get into position, Cecil?
How do I get out of this?
If you want to get out of it, you simply say,
"I'm a celebrity, get me out from under this tramp."
OK? Are you ready, Cecil?
  Introduce the beard to Mr May!
  Rub away!
Now, some of you may remember Cecil
from being in the group Tears For Fears.
He was the singer. Not the woolly haired one, he was the other one.
And we copped him last week in the King's Cross area...
He's done it! He's done it!
Was it bad?
Was it terrible?
  Are you all right?
  I'm fine.
Would you like a drink or anything? You've got the rope...
I didn't mind his beard at all   it was his penis pressing into my...
Was it very hard?
Look what you've won!
  Fantastic. Thank you very much.
  Well done, Mr May!
That's Shooting Stars!
  Well done, Louie.
  Thank you.
