Here in the East, it was Labour's night in the Norwich elections,
after the Green Party failed in its bid to become the largest group on
the council. And power struggles in the the UK
Independence Party, as its Hello and welcome back after the
summer break, I'm Etholle George. Now for the part of the programme
just for us here in the East. Coming up...
A bitter leadership battle, as the UK Independence Party fights over
its future direction. And or we will be hearing about the
future of the Green Party from Adrian Ramsay, the Norwich
councillor and deputy leader of the party, who is at the Greens
But first, Labour wins an election. Voters have been to the polls this
week, but only in Norwich, in an unusual set of elections for the
city council. It was seen as the first test of public opinion since
the coalition came to power and, if it was, David Cameron and Nick
Clegg had bolt better watch out. Of course, in Norwich the Green Party
are in second place and were hoping to overtake the minority Labour
administration to become the largest party on the council, which
would have been a first anywhere in the country.
Only a third of the seats were up for grabs and of those Labour were
defending six seats, the Green Party four, the Lib Dems two and
the Conservatives one. By the end of the night, Labour had gained one
seat, as had the Green Party. The Lib Dems lost one and so did the
Conservatives. Here is Deborah McGurran.
Labour delight as they held on in ward after ward. They have not had
so a good night for several years. They had fought a campaign which
largely focussed on the forthcoming government cuts, but even they
seemed surprised when it paid off. Seats where they thought they might
struggle delivered comfortable majorities. Their vote increased
across the city and they gained a seat from the Conservatives.
have largely seen the city through the recession. They are looking for
a party to lead them through that. What they want is an administration
that will speak for the city. The Green Party also had cause to
celebrate in what was a good night for them. They gained a seat from
the Lib Dems, but fail din the quest to wrest control from Labour.
    failed in their quest. Although they share of the vote slipped a
little, they retained all of their seats. The Green Party are still
the main opposition to Labour here, as well as remaining the largest
green grouping anywhere in Britain. Ever election since 2002, the Green
Party has made gains and am sure we will continue to do that. Obviously,
the students not been here has not helped us. We would have had at a
much bigger share of the vote of the students where still in town.
So why did Norwich go to the polls this week? It is because the city
council elections were cancelled pending elections for a unitary
authority in the city. The coalition has now scrapped the all
unitary plans, so elections had to go ahead in a third of the city
council's seats. Only one of those was held by a
Conservative. In a dismal night for them, their group leader was
unseated by Labour's return to form and, across the board, the
Conservative vote was down. We need to fight back in the next few
months and we hope to fight back in the early elections next me.
As Labour's confidence grew, Lib Dem hopes declined. It was a
reversal of the parliamentary fortunes in this same hall just
four months ago, when the Lib Dems unseated Labour's former Home
Secretary Charles Clarke. The Lib Dems took comfort from the seat
they held, but they also lost a seat and watched their vote fall
again and again. They denied that joining the coalition was a factor
in the campaign. There are cuts that have to be made. I do not
think they would be happy with any government, whether it was a
continuation of the Labour government or not. They do not want
to take their medicine. The electorate are very quick to judge,
but if you do not have money in your purse, you cannot spend it.
The turnout was a mere 28%, down by more than 7%. Whether that affected
the results or not, it leaves the two parties of their coalition with
a mere handful of seats, while the Greens keep up their momentum in
Norwich and the Labour Party welcomes something of a return to
form. Here with me in the studio is
Anthony Little, who led the Conservatives on the council before
he lost his seat on Thursday, Steve Morphew, the Labour leader of the
council, James Wright, a new councillor for the Lib Dems and,
from the Green Party Conference in Birmingham, Councillor Adrian
Ramsay. You did not think you would do it
on Thursday night, did you? Have you not got confidence in Labour
policies? Certainly not. It was simply just the type of election it
was and the timing of it. I was expecting a low turnout, but I must
admit it was not a particularly representative election. It is it a
good time to be running any sort of council? I suppose it is a
difficult time because whoever is in power is going to have to take
some difficult financial decisions. But it is good at that people would
rather experienced counsellors take these decisions, or rather than a
whole new bunch of inexperience councillors coming in. Why did the
Conservative Party do so poorly? think the time they played a part
in that. When we were canvassing in the labour wards, their vote seemed
buoyant and the people seemed very ready to come out. In the
Conservative wards, I did not get that same sense of confidence. I am
concerned that the low turnout Costa's seats on the night. Adrian,
where you disappointed not to become the largest party on the
council? We hope that we would get that, but congratulations to the
Labour Party for holding on. But we did make gains and the Green Party
is very much on the up in Norwich. We did well in the general election
and did well again on Thursday. We are delighted with the short of
confidence that the people have shown dinners. We ate his talk
about the Liberal Democrats. You're a share of the vote fell away again.
Why do you think there was? There where negative. Views about the
coalition, but just as equally there were very positive remarks as
well. I do nothing that had a great bearing. The percentage of the
popular vote was broadly in line with the 2009 county council
elections. Are you a fan of coalitions? I was not a great fan
at first. But having seen it in action, I have become a bit more in
favour of it. When you're dealing with the deficit the size we are,
it is important that there are consensus politics. Do you think
the game that the Liberal Party have been his squeeze slightly
because of the effect of the coalition? Nor, I feel that the
people believed in what we have done at a council level. Does the
Green Party need to change something to appeal to a wider
vote? Not, or vote around the country suggests we are doing well
and end nor rich in particular, people support what we're doing. We
need to show that we are creating more jobs in areas such as reusable
energy and home insulation. That is things that we will be always
pushing for an things that people voted for last Thursday. There are
going to be an interesting set of elections, next year? Absolutely,
but I do not believe that a gene in what he says is true. We need to
make things happen even against the problems we have.
Now, just two days before the Norwich election, a bombshell
dropped which may well have influenced its outcome.
It was announced that property group Connaught, which ran waste
collection, cleaning and housing services for the city council, was
about to go into administration. 600 Norwich jobs were on the line.
But on Friday came news of a Â£28m deal with construction firm Morgan
Sindall, to take over the majority of Connaught's contracts. And while
that brought a glimmer of hope, workers are still anxious about job
security. They are very worried. What they need to know is whether
the new company has actually bought these contracts. We would hope that
the jobs would stay, but at the moment that is not clear. She these
workers be worried? Yes, because their employer is in a poor
condition in administration. After this, we're going over to city hall
to find out what the very latest says. It is very important that
services in the city are maintained and there are many services that
are reliant on this contract. it wrong for this contract to be
taken away? No, a lot of people were rewriting history as regards
this. The company was at that time will respect it and all of the Duke
due diligence was done. We used experts and lawyers and everybody
said it was fine. We must move on. The Labour group have to take the
lowest tender available don't they? Not this is our life. We will be
asking questions in contract whether this appeared to be too
good to be true. We need to look at how council services where
delivered at we think it would be better if they were delivered
directly by the councils, so that they could offer better services
and better conditions for the workers. We would want these
services to be brought back in house. You're party has been quick
to point the finger, but a things appeared wrong at the time, why did
you not see more at the time? did it. But at the moment, we need
to sort this out. We have elderly residents getting prepared for
winter care and women need to make sure that services are paid
provided for them. The air as a rewriting of history. None of the
other parties opposed this. Does this make a mockery of the
government wanting the private sector to take over what the public
sector has been doing? No, it means we have to be a lot more diligent
in the way we award these contracts. In the short term, it means we have
to make sure these services are being provided, that bins are been
ended and that schools are getting their meals. Thank you all very
much. Pressure is mounting on Huntingdon
MP Jonathan Djanogly, after damaging claims that he used a
private detective agency to investigate his own constituency
party members. Mr Djanogly has admitted he may have over reacted
after employing the firm to find out the source of allegations made
during the MPs expenses row. We have been told there is concern
among party members and Mr Djanogli could be called to an extraordinary
meeting. Richard Daniel reports. The MP for Huntingdon has admitted
calling in private detectives to investigate members of his own
constituency association. As Jonathan Djanogly was caught in the
expenses scandal, he wanted to find out if there were leaks from people
in his local party. Last July, he had to explain to constituents why
he had claimed expenses for thousands of pounds paid to a
student, who was also his au pair, for cleaning his Cambridgeshire
home. Derek Holley, former leader of Huntingdonshire council was one
of those who was investigated. personally very disappointed and
feel let down that I have been investigated without my knowledge.
But neighbouring MP and minister Andrew Lansley defended his actions.
Defended his actions he was very upset about the way stories were
being published about him which appeared to be private information
about him and his family. When you're that upset, you feel at
Desire to do something about it. There was not the same sympathy in
Huntingdon. If he had a problem he should have got the police in. To
hire your own detective agency seems a bit over the top. His seems
very strange that you would hire private investigators to look at
your own staff. It sounds a little bit paranoid to me.
So far, Downing Street have backed the Justice Minister and praised
him as a hard worker, but it remains to be seen if he will be
called to another extraordinary meeting by his local party. He
survived the last one. Would he be able to pull that off again?
Adrian Ramsay is still with us in Birmingham at the Green Party
Conference, where yesterday he spoke against cuts.
Green issues are at the forefront of politics at the moment. Is that
a concern to the party? What is at the forefront is protecting the
public services against privatisation. That has been the
key message of our conference and rightly so. A lot of people feel
let down after the election. They did novel for a Conservative
government and the did not fought for Vince Cable announcing all
these cuts. The Green Party have got stable policies for the futures
about protecting services and tackling the huge environmental
problems we have. You oppose spending cuts, like
Norfolk Connexions, but how are we going to get the economy back on
track if we do not take some pain now? On tax we need to be clamping
down on tax loopholes and looking at savings much in much wider areas,
such as the war in Afghanistan. But we're doing things locally, where
we are investing in green policies in the likes of Transport and
Industry. It is things like that which will get the economy back on
track.? So the Greens are in buoyant mood
this weekend, but things were a little different last weekend when
members of UKIP came together for their annual conference. They
failed to make any headway in the general election and now face a
bitter leadership battle involving one of our MEPs. Andrew Sinclair
was there. At least one of the parties is
still going to the seaside for its conference and in Torquay the
weather did not disappoint. UKIP members bathed in the sunshine, but
they did not seem to be enjoying themselves very much.
It was all very different to last year. Then we were in Southport,
successful Euro Elections and with the expenses scandal in full flow,
UKIP believed their time had come. I think we could be in some sort of
alliance in power in two or three years' time. If not this election,
then maybe the one after that. So far, things have not got off to
a good start. You could say Nigel Farage's plane crash on polling day
was the perfect metaphor for UKIPs general election campaign. Despite
all the effort, UKIP did not win a single seat and their leader Lord
this conference was about where UKIP goes from here. The lazy days
of the UK Independence Party are over. And one of ours MEPs had
clear views. David Campbell Bannerman is already
deputy leader and now wants to become leader. In his opinion, the
party needs to become more serious. We need to get more serious.
And that was seen as an attack on this man. Nigel Farage's style of
leadership is very different to what Mr Campbell Bannerman
envisages. I believe I am the one who can lead from the front. We are
an academic party, it not be gingerbread Group. It is all very
well to criticise a party, but when you are part of that leadership
team, you have to fall in line. the party is going into particular
ways. To the get more serious or do they continue the gimmicks? Former
Eastern MEP Jeffery Titford has been brought back as interim leader
and he is clear about what his party needs. We need to inspire the
members. If you cannot inspire the members, you are not going to
inspire the electorate. Kilroy Silk, dodgy MEPs,
controversial candidates, weak leaders   UKIP has lurched from one
crisis to another. But despite that, it has become established in Europe
and is slowly adding to its number of local councillors. The next
leader will determine whether this is as good as it gets or if the
