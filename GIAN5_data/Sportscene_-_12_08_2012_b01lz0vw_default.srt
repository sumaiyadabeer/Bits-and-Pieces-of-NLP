The second SPL weekend of the season handed Hibs the chance to
Winners Hearts, whose manager John McGlynn joins Billy Dodds and
myself in the studio, were looking to extend an 11 match unbeaten run
against their biggest rivals and The Hibernian manager continues to
make changes to his team. Hearts had Danny Grainger available after
had Danny Grainger available after suspension but this was the team
that got off to a winning start was alive to the danger. He just
but his opponent was right in front of that. This year is certainly a
foul here on Templeton but there is going to be no yellow card. Look at
his reaction. Hearts can consider themselves fortunate still to have
weak back pass. That was an error from one of the most experienced
players on the park. The visitors are ahead. Calamitous defending
their. Hearts looking to rub salt Leigh Griffiths. Expect the
unexpected when this man is around. Everyone expected that to go across
goal and it almost found the back Griffiths is onside with the
equaliser. It is the equaliser. A terrific move from Hibernian. Such
a cool finish. Through the legs of the goalkeeper and then off the
post. Hibernian deservedly level to keep his eyes open, I think.
Temple and swings it end. MacGowan target. No Pat Fenlon in D
Hibernian technical area following hand in this match. Can they edge
in front? There is Leigh Griffiths with a lovely touch. He cannot
match the turn with a finish. Terrific play but the really poor
in the end. Clancy again with another of his long throw ins. A
touch of the head and this time the keeper has to throw himself to
catch it. Campbell took MacDonald. Campbell left all alone at the back
Hearts look to snatch a winner at the death. The keeper misses Beth
again but MacGowan could not find You are never going to complain
about a point at Easter Road but do you think today that the players
believe the pre match publicity that they would find it easy?
might have been our downfall today. Last week against St Johnstone we
played very well. We had a lot of confidence and optimism setting out
today. We never really lived up to the hype. Did Hibernian replace
some of their pride after the hand and Horror Show? A think they did.
I think the formation suited them. I think now 4 4 2 is a basic
formation that allows the players to know the position and it showed
today. One of the most experienced players on the pitch made one of
the most basic mistakes here. much so. It was a gamble. It was
difficult for Alan Maybury but fair play to Andrew Driver who followed
it in and played very well. He read the game well and scored but there
was a good recovery. The goalkeeper should have had some help from his
outfield players. There was a big reception from the Hibernian fans
when this man came off. He is dangerous, isn't he? On his day he
is a very dangerous player. He is a threat. You know him well? I'd do.
I think it is all about Leigh Griffiths because his touch needed
to be perfect and he did not have a lot of time. It looks simple but it
was a hard game and are difficult shot to take. Was he lucky to stay
on the pitch for this reaction? may well have been. In this
situation here he certainly took a bit of training. He has certainly
been provoked by the amount of challenges and tackles. Perhaps if
the referee had blown for a free kick it would not have led to that
situation. Clancy is a little bit naughty as well coming in the air.
You cannot do what he did. He had a lash out and be referee handled it
well. It might have been the experience that sort him grabbing
his head that let him off. I do not think there was too much doubt
about that one. Afterwards the player is always going to be
walking a tightrope. This was the build up to the equaliser. Was that
a foul? Should he have been booked? He is going to run the risk when he
is putting himself about a bit. has got a reputation. I know I am
looking at that and once you have been booked, it was cynical, I
think Barr has certainly touched the ball and had to calm himself
because he was lucky to stay on the pitch. You had a home win and an
away draw in the Derby. The number of players you have lost, high
profile players like Skacel, Elliott, Craig Beattie, it is a
tough job? Yes, but I knew that when I took the job. I was very up
for that. I was caretaker manager and a youth team coach. I have
worked there for many years and know the sort of talent they have.
They have been playing well. There is a lot of experience in the team.
I am very much up for the challenge. Can you get more players in? Will
you? Are there any murmurings from abroad? Do you have any
alternatives for a central striker? We are light in the striking
department and we could do with bringing one or two end. Perhaps
getting a good score in Liverpool could help our chances. Until
September comes we will see what we have got. So you are going to the
chair man? You mentioned Liverpool, is that an exciting or a
frightening prospect to be squaring up to them in the Europa League?
bit of both. I had someone watching them today who said I have nothing
to worry about, it was a bit Tonge in cheek, to be fair! European
nights are fantastic. They have got such a pedigree in European
football. We will remember the last time they played a Scottish side,
Celtic on the way to civil, Celtic won. It is a tall order for any
Scottish team. In it is a different class. It is going to be difficult.
I would have preferred the best scenario Four Hearts to get through
a couple of rounds and then make Liverpool. It will be a tall order
Inverness were disappointed to miss out on all three points on the
opening weekend in Paisley when they conceded a stoppage time
equaliser. Could they get there at the second attempt? Kilmarnock were
the second attempt? Kilmarnock were in the Highland capital. Jane Lewis
in the Highland capital. Jane Lewis has the action.
Just over 3,000 fans turning out to watch this. The home fans almost
gave    almost had something to cheer about. There was a shoulder
and vault in the opening goal. Draper knock it down with Andrew
McKay a rushed end. The Kilmarnock captain had to clear this danger.
Manuel Pascali did well. Kilmarnock had an opportunity to get back in
the match with half an hour gone. The referee pointed to the spot.
Danny Racchi kept his shot low. Ryan S and kept it out. The
Inverness keeper held on to the follow up shot from James Dayton.
Another injury blow for Kilmarnock when there was an knee injury.
Better news after 10 minutes. Manuel Pascali equalised just after
half times. The header was untouched on the goal line. The
second half saw a few chances but some drama. As Tudur Jones raced
through, he was stopped in his tracks. The Inverness player was
not happy with the challenge and reacted. Straight red car    red
card for the head butt. The manager said he could not complain about
the decision and would have words with him. Terry Butcher would have
been happy if his side had gone on to win with ten men and the newly
dead. This ball in was met by Nick Ross. Bell saved the day again.
Michael Nelson was unmarked, but went over. These sides were at it
went over. These sides were at it again as they shared the points.
How do you compare Inverness last season with this season? Andrew
Shinnie is back in and he was injured last season. He is an
excellent player. Terry Butcher has to turn around the squad every year
because of injuries. He has done a great job. Always a difficult game
because Terry Butcher's team are always fired up. Probably better at
Tynecastle than at Inverness I would suggest. We are looking to
win. Good performances by the goalkeepers yesterday. They work on
the training ground to make saves like this. Be is is what they do.
like this. Be is is what they do. They will have a second ball for
the reaction. Excellent reaction for the second one. This is a Cammy
Bell. He has been a good goalkeeper for a few seasons. He is excellent.
The goalkeeper has kept the scoreline down. In England, they
would look for someone taller. goalkeepers are capable of stopping
shops. One player you want face next weekend is Paul Waine Tudur
Jones who saw red. I don't imagine Inverness    is Tudur Jones who saw
red. I don't imagine Inverness will appeal against this. He just lost
it. That I have been there myself. It is quite an knotty tackle. That
anger management course is probably needed there.
SPL new arrivals Ross County went to Pittodrie yesterday on the brink
of an amazing record. Avoiding defeat against new look Aberdeen
would take them to a full year of league football unbeaten. 14,000
were there. Commentary from Liam lost and Celtic Park last weekend.
Mark Reynolds was on the bench. One change for Ross County. Sam Morrow
was support for the striker. A promising start to life in the
SPL from Ross County last week. Good work by the Dons. Good flick
from Vernon who was unlucky. This is the first real attack. There was
a shout for a penalty. Boyd was up ended here by Andersen. This one is
for Scott Morrow. This is a great chance for Ross County. He has to
try to get these shots on target. Hughes has options in the middle.
This is easy for Michael Fraser. Support is arriving to the right,
but he goes for goal. Michael Fraser will be delighted if they
come from that distance all day. Derek Adams is closing in on a
calendar year undefeated in a league matches. That is a fine
effort from Richard Brittain. If that had been on target, that would
have been a real test for Langfield. He is trying to get it on to his
left foot. He wanted to hit it on the left for it.    oh left foot.
Aberdeen have plenty of players waiting for it. Hughes has been
terrific today. Veron and was there. Chance of the game so far. It falls
for Gavin Rae. Craig Brown must be getting worried as his team have
had so much dominance in the final third. They have not been able to
test Michael Fraser fully. Osborne again it took he's.    Osborne took
Johnny Hayes. He must have thought he was scoring. The rebound was
wide by Gavin Rae. Aberdeen looking for three points. Johnny Hayes.
That is good stuff from him. He had options in the middle. This is
Grant Munro. Experienced player in the SPL. This is Richard Brittain.
Langfield saves and is screwed over by Scott. Good play by Ross County.
   hit over the bar by Scott. Good play by Ross County. Vernon has to
score. It is not Aberdeen's day. It was not their day at Celtic Park
last week either. Stephen Hughes is not it renowned goalscorer. Fraser
was rooted. County have held firm so far. Aberdeen with lots of
attacking options on the park. The Seine is in towards Vernon, but it
no power in the header. The word go wasteful comes to mind at for
wasteful comes to mind at for Aberdeen today.
I guess you're probably not too surprised that they have extended
that unbeaten records    unbeaten record for a whole calendar year.
It is tremendous. They will be delighted with that start. It is
striking the balance for Ross County. Will they have enough
attacking threat? I think it is about team spirit. There are no
star individuals, but you have the players up front and Richard
Brittain in midfield with two good defenders at the back. It is
eclectic, but they have not yet scored. Aberdeen are creating
plenty, but they would have wanted to get a couple of these away.
Craig has a strong squad in Aberdeen now. Last week, they were
unfortunate not to get a point at Celtic Park. The signs are good. I
would have loved to have seen them win the game yesterday. I think we
need a strong Aberdeen and Hibs. They have do when games like this
to get the big crowds coming back. We could lose a couple of 1,000
spectators. Vernon will score goals. After a midweek grilling in Greece,
and ahead of their next European challenge against Spanish side
Levante, Motherwell were at home to St Johnstone yesterday, both in
search of a first win of the season. from Motherwell following in their
exertions in Athens in midweek. No signs of tiredness there. That
might just have found the bottom corner. Craig. Making life awkward
for the Motherwell defence and four Randolph. Lot looking for options.
   Law. Liam Craig can strike from distance and he does on that
occasion. The goalkeeper sees it wide. Taking no chances. Al
Hutchinson is caught by a fine. That will be a booking for the
striker in his first SPL start. That was slack from Motherwell.
Miller takes over on the edge of the box. Not too far away. One yard
wide. Not a great header from Hammell. Craig has space to shoot
and also for the rebound. Miller goes down and Hamel has been at
penalised. Penalty kick. This was terrific play from Liam Craig.
Miller burst into the area. Difficult to see how much contact,
but Hamel is off. Dave Nikkei will have the chance from the penalty
spot to put the visitors ahead    Dave Mackay. What a save from
Randolph. It was not the most powerful penalty. Quite poor. Craig
swimming in the corner. There is Davidson! St Johnstone are in front.
They did not miss their second chance. No cover at the front post.
Three Motherwell defenders trying one. St Johnstone really piling on
one. St Johnstone really piling on the pressure now. That is a nice
glance down from Pegden.    Higdon. There is the equaliser for
Motherwell. A man down and a goal down and they have pulled it level.
Hutchison spotted that one and is taking down by Vine again. Find is
going to go off here. That is his second yellow card of the afternoon.
   Vine. It is ten men for each team. No doubt about it, that was
the correct decision. We carry gets something on him.    McKay. What a
save! Hebden must have believed save! Hebden must have believed
that was goal bound.    Higdon. You were there yesterday for Radio
Scotland, Billy, do you think the heat of Athens affected them?
were not at their best but funnily enough they got the breakthrough
later in the game. It was really entertaining that game, a lot of
talking points and really good football. Overall I enjoyed the
match. A penalty and a sending off. The camera does not catch it
completely but it was not a huge protest, was it? I do not think so.
It was some sort of fumble. It seemed like the referee was given
no choice if it was going to be a penalty but it does look harsh.
two pretty similar charges on Hutchison led to Vine being sent
off? Once you have been booked for the first one it was crazy to fly
into it again. He held the ball up well and could have had a couple of
goals as well, he was a tidy signing. He has a great left foot
but the keeper did well. Another narrow pass and a great opportunity
there. A not a great struck penalty but the funny thing was, I think St
Johnstone in this part of the game should have killed it off. Credit
to Motherwell. They rallied and got the equaliser and could even have
nicked it at the end. Bearing in mind what the team had been through
during the week, they had a man set off and were probably knackered.
They showed great character and spirit considering be travelling
that they have had. It was a great header. This was Sean Hutcheon son.
Miller is celebrating their but as much as he gets the penalty, the
block and the clench of the firsts, sometimes the defending wins you
the match. A great goal and saving tackle. Are you envious at how they
have added to their striking players in the squad? They have
signed Craig Beattie and they have Rowan buying    Vine. Indeed. They
have got a strong squad, they have made some really good signings.
Top flight football returned to Dens Park for the first time in
it was snatched out of the a. Pressure from Parker.    out of the
air. Kenny McLean is going for the dead and he has the opening goal!
He took advantage of the ball coming his way and that is
perfectly placed. The goalkeeper beaten at the post. The ball is
seen away. Sampson was not too happy with his defence but he was
rooted as that ball was going to go past them. Steven Thompson came
back. That was very clumsy. Ian Davidson goes down. Steven Thompson
the back of his opponent. The keeper says free kick. I think the
attempt was certainly there to play the ball but from another angle
that could have been a second yellow card. McGregor might be in
trouble here. Great play. Samson with a save! Searching for an
equaliser. Very direct but Sampson lines for the centre half. Conroy
plays it through. Kenny McLean has got a touch. The man went down. Any
Maclean look like he had played the ball. That was enough. No penalty.
He stumbled, but the ball was played. White to M8.    Wide to
Imrie. And Sam Parkin scores! Just a couple of minutes ago Dundee had
a shout for a penalty and now they are down. A chance for Stuart. They
are creating chances. That will be giving be done be boss
encouragement. But they have got to take those chances. Davidson plays
through and here is a chance for a consolation goal. On D Day they are
denied even that in the final Dundee had plenty chances. They
have got another chance next week at Tannadice. There were a couple
of games last year where they had an even bigger crowd. They have got
huge support. It is not their support that is going to let them
down. They might stay up. I do not know if it is too early to vote for
goal of the season but this one could be up for it? I think so. It
could not have been better. There are a couple of people asking if
Big Rab could have done better. He has cut it. You know the line is 42,
I thought you might make that mental leap and realise it was from
41. Our team of technicians worked it out because of the size of the
I think it is all about Kenny McLean. Already a contender for
goal of the season. The intent to strike it with that much pace and
put car on the ball. It was a fantastic goal. Last season St
Mirren played a lot of great football so I guess for them four
goals in the first two games of the season is pretty good going? That's
right. They have good players up front. They will be delighted at
the start they have made. That man went to Queen of the South last
season from St Johnstone. I saw him last week and he looked sharp. You
are right, great football. This season they are scoring goals.
that is then top of the week! Just on goal business    goal difference
as you will point out! Delighted with that. Sitting at the top of
the table but it is early days. certainly is. Then be reckoned
there were some decisions which did not go their way but they did have
a player who could have been sent off. We have already spoken about
it in the programme that once you have been booked, you do not take
chances. I think he was not intending to do that. He was a bit
unlucky. He is not really a dirty player. He is more clumsy. He will
tell you that himself. We looked at this penalty as well. Is it a
penalty? He has a chance of getting the ball. He has clearly played the
ball. I think of the player still has a chance of getting it before
the goalkeeper... I do not know what you think that it could have
been given. There is confusion because yes, Kenny McLean does get
the ball but then he goes into the back of Mark Stewart so is it
getting the ball that is crucial or taking the player out that is
crucial? There are two phase is to it as you say. Let's just sit on
