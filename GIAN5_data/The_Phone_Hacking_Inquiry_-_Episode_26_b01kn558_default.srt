Time for a review of the Leveson Inquiry.
An implication was clear. News International turn against
coalition. That is the high watermark of the arrogance of power
without was there the ability.    without responsibility. Lord
Justice Leveson returned after a week in which his inquiry did not
sit but which still saw him making headlines. When he got back to
business, he had plenty to say about that article. As the inquiry
resumed on day 87... On Friday 15th June, the Mail on Sunday contacted
the inquiry, outlining in broad terms a story that quotes an
excellent source. It was a tale that began with a speech in
February in which Michael Gove said there was a chilling atmosphere
towards freedom of expression coming from the Leveson Inquiry.
The day after the address, the prime minister said Michael Gove
had made an important point. want a vibrant press that feels it
the Mail on Sunday. Lord Justice Leveson got in contact with the
most senior civil servant in the country, Sir Jeremy Heywood. The
newspaper said that conversation had been interpreted as a threat to
resign. I want to to find out whether Michael Gove was speaking
for the government, whether it was thought that the existence of the
inquiry was having a chilling effect on healthy and vibrant
journalism, and whether the government had a few on any
potential recommendations. That is, I was concerned about the
perception that the inquiry was being undermined while it was
taking place. I was told that no fixed view had been formed. And
that it was wrong to interpret any concerns all collective view.
said the papers were entitled to hold him to account. However, it
can be argued that what has happened is an example of an
approach that seeks to convert any attempt to question the conduct of
the press as an attack on free speech. He knew he was being
closely watched for signs he had already decided on his conclusions.
On every day of the inquiry, every exchange I have with a witness will
be analysed and considered in order to reveal a hidden agenda. There is
no hidden agenda. There were recollections of meeting James
Murdoch and Alistair Darling from one of the witnesses. It was
gruesome. He criticised Alistair Darling over the earlier decision
that Mr Darling had taken over the acquisition of BSkyB.    the
requirement of Sky to sell its shares in BSkyB. It was both
socially inappropriate for what would normally be an exchange of
political gossip and inappropriate otherwise. It was a classic English
embarrassment where no one knew where to look. He did not warm to
the view that papers were the voice of their readers. When I read a
column for a leader in the papers saying, our leaders say this, I am
sceptical. They I to judge it by totally unscientific methods like
volume of e mails. They do not analyse what their readers believe.
In most cases, these opinions are formed by half a dozen people.
it was later explained that comment was important to papers because
they con    compete with broadcasters. They no longer want
to be a newspaper of record but to provide analysis for comment. They
do not want to regurgitate what their readers have seen on the Ten
O'clock News bulletins the night before. That has changed the
character of the product. It is something that the inquiry
has heard it time and time again   newspapers his television and radio.
An inquiry barrister asked if that... Will all of that left
political coverage? You have explained that you take the view
that most people have crossed the line between scepticism of
politicians and cynicism. When you see most papers, do you include
your own? I would regard the Independent as whole police
sceptical. I would say the Guardian is healthily sceptical I would say
that papers like the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph have become too
cynical. There was nothing year in rough handling of politicians,
according to a former Times political editor. There were
occasions when the treatment of certain politicians was over the
top. I can recall the newspaper trade and of John Major, Neil
Kinnock, Gordon Brown, where it got too personal.    newspaper
treatment. However, I do not regret the passing of the age of deference
at all. There has not been much deference to Jimmy Carr since the
Times reveal details of his taxation arrangements. The Leveson
Inquiry heard how the investigation was pursued. In our series of
investigations last week, the disclosures about tax avoidance, we
used an undercover reporter to become involved in that. There was
a lot of discussion within the Times about the way we went about
our investigation. High relief provided that you know what you are
after her is in the public interest, you have to believe that what you
are dealing in the public interest. Such techniques are perfectly OK.
Channel 4 News has long prided itself on the exclusives. But they
may have missed a few opportunities. One would be staking out Downing
Street and he would be aware of the comings and goings of some of the
Peter Kay    individuals have featured in this inquiry. I do not
know why we never really asked what they were doing there. In some ways,
we did not ask for because we felt it would be visited upon us.
Sometimes broadcasters opened their cheque books. We paid Monica
Lewinsky for the first interview that she gave after the shenanigans
with Bill Clinton. However, that, in my opinion, that was different.
The idea that you are paying someone to give you information
about... Or give you access to material that they are able to
access through their work, that is totally unacceptable. Jon Snow is
both a journalist and celebrity. He has his own tussles with the media.
As someone who has been apologise to by a tabloid, the original
offence spread over five pages, the conviction that it was completely
untrue, the retraction, the apology... The apology was 1.5
inches. The wrestle was whether they should be a photograph of me a
part it or not. He had no problem with attack in the papers. There is
something SED is about    insidious about Associated Newspapers. I
believe they have an agenda for trying to undermine or destroy the
careers of individual people in public life. That is not healthy.
This is not a question of suppressing press freedom. It is
about dealing with the important things in life instead. It is
pernicious and I think at times mendacious. And I try to analyse if
a lot, I tried to see what it is that makes this worthwhile. Where
does it come from? What role does the editor at Associated Newspapers
Mendacious is quite a charge, but he was not asked to provide any
evidence of his own. Next up was the Mail on Sunday journalist to
wrote that story about the contact with the Cabinet Secretary. Yet
despite spending 20 minutes addressing the issue that morning,
the judge reached what was perhaps a surprising conclusion. I have no
intention of asking any questions about 17th June. There is some
nonsense that I would like to deal with. He is said that the reporter
had been invited before he wrote his article. He was questioned
about the comment that found its way into his pieces? I tried to
rattle of Nine News stories in a fair and balanced way. So when you
write a news report, that you would insure, or try to ensure as its you
can, that there is no comment or opinion without our article?
Broadly speaking, yes. But when you are riding a news story, there is
an element of story and Alaric    narrative. And, if you were
reporting the bare facts, you would be left with a pretty dry story, at
the end of the day. At the end of the day, there is an element of
interpretation. I know people who were involved in that flow of
information. It was an open secret that Downing Street could more or
less dictate the terms of the journalists. And then we heard from
this up to the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, who also made
bread Michelle, in a state room at Number Ten. News Corp's attempts to
buy the be    BSkyB shares that it did not already Yarin, was on the
agenda. I was not entirely surprised that we would take the
opportunity, given that we were sitting in a run together, to try
and pick my brains. In an e mail to James Murdoch, Fred Michele said
that they should discuss any Labour on board as it would influence
Vince Cable. He had no recollection. It strikes me in the way that this
is phrased, there is an implication that I was offering strategic
advice to News Corp. In return for the furtherance of their beards. At
that time, it was in progress. And that I was offering that advice
with the implication that Vince Cable would be receptive if they
took one stance or another in relation to the Labour Party. That,
I completely reject. 28 people, 22 of them children, died when a train
crashed in Switzerland in March. A British boy was one of the victims.
A solicitor and friend of the family told the inquiry that his
nine year old sister was photographed on the porch of the
hotel has signed to grieving families. And how newspapers quoted
from a message posted on a block set up for the children's family is.
The Daily Mail published an article and online on their website, the
online article, a copy which is exhibit three, included the
photograph of his sister, the family photographs which I will
describe in a minute, and the photograph of Sebastian in his
skiing outfit which was taken from the or mind block. Some of the
pictures were taken from Sebastian putts father's Facebook account.
The photographs published of your clients on holiday, one at croc to
show only Sebastian, and were taken from Mr Rolls's Facebook page on
Friday, at a time when they were openly accessible. We know that the
page's prissy sessions have now increased and we have removed the
photographs from the website. Mail expressed its in the but only
recently removed the picture of his sister. The son was asked not to
print a pitch of Sebastian, they used one anyway. British
journalists turned up at the family home in Belgium. Although the
reporter was said to be polite and somewhat apologetic. There was no
sense of apology at all from some in the foreign media. One Belgian
newspaper and one Belgian magazine printed that picture of her lane up
on their front pages. That is exhibited in exhibit a lemon. Ask
you to turn that up because of the distressing incident that took
place in respect of it, which is that Edward saw the magazine in a
supermarket with his daughter as it was Premier League displayed. And
they were both very upset by it. As they passed it, another member of
the public 0.2 them both. A letter to the Press Complaints Commission,
did see fewer reporters outside the home and meant that none were
President as his funeral. Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb are used to be an
adviser to Nick Clegg. While Business Secretary Vince Cable was
deciding whether to report the news Corp BSkyB bid to Ofcom. And then
Fred Lamb took two meetings. It was uncovered by his wife on the
morning of this appearance. He read that account of what he described
as an extraordinary encounter. have been supportive of the
coalition, but if it goes the wrong way, he is worried about the
implications. It was brazen. The case is referred to Ofcom, they   
turn nasty. Refer the case and the implication was clear out   the
News Corp would turn against the coalition. He cut not remember the
words that Michelle had used. But I remember that I left that meeting
with a very clear understanding that, firstly, they had been trying
to be helpful since the election, through their newspapers. But, that
if things went the wrong way, in terms of the actions that Vince
Cable took, in exercising his responsibility, then he was
concerned that things could change. And I took that to mean very
clearly, that the positive coverage that they had given, might change.
Now it Clegg told the inquiry that he did not regard the threat as
place at the meeting. It left an obvious question. I have been asked
if we this to you, why were you so late in coming forward with these
terms, with his evidence? I have been thinking for some time about
whether I should contact the inquiry. I had been thinking over
new ministerial responsibilities. When Vince Cable gave his evidence,
I felt that I had to tell the story of what happened. In a sense, you
are left with a gap, you are left with a lack of clarity. I felt that
it was important that you got that full story. We have long thought
that we knew the full story about the former Conservative minister
accused of conducting an affair with an actress while wearing a
I never felt the need to own one. And that was a total invention. And
then Mr Clifford, I am amazed, it does not take his own very
seriously. This was cooked up between him and the then deputy
editor of the Sun, Mr Higgins. Because the then editor, he is now
of course they senior statesman. I don't want to go to my grave with
the only thing people remembering about me as some Chelsea shirt.
That is a sign and that is the high water mark of the arrogance of
power without responsibility. Because, they made that up, they
made that up with total cynicism. In this telling evidence on the
final day of the inquiry is looking at the relationship between press
and politicians. The former minister possibly best known for
something that he says they made up. They know    what no one can ignore
