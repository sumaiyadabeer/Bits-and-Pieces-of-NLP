Oh, how do you do, how do you do, how do you do, how do you do?
Welcome to the QI zoo for a show about animals that start with an H.
Lined up for feeding time, we have the hawk eyed Sean Lock!
Thank you. Thank you.
  The hare footed Ross Noble...
And the hung like a horsefly Alan Davies.
Now...
Let's have a peep at your horns. Sean goes...
Oh, what's that? That's a woman sound.
  Ross goes...
And Alan goes...
  Oh.
Where better to begin than question one?
We start with an opportunity for easy points.
  Two points for each animal you can name that has horns.
  Yes?
  OK, goat, elk,
buffalo, ox,
  Dixon, Prancer, Rudolph...
Cats who dress up as devils on Hallowe'en.
Um... Oxen, did I say that?
Goats. My mother.
Unicorn!
  Unicorn, no!
  Why?
  Rhino.
  Antelope!
  Cat!
  Antelope is fine.
  I already said cat!
  What about a Viking dog?
  There we go.
Cos it would have the horns.
It might!
Strictly speaking, I know you'll say the Vikings didn't have horns on.
The point about a horn is that it must be bone. Technically,
a horn is bone, not what a rhino has, which is...?
  Hair.
  Hair, exactly.
  Tell that to the rhino.
  Exactly.
  I think you'll find it's a horn.
I don't know if you've ever seen a wet rhino,
but it actually just flops down, like that.
Quite often, you'll find, on nature programmes,
when you zoom in on the sound,
you hear them going, "Oh, I'm having a bad horn day!"
  I've got split ends!
  I thought it was like a fingernail.
  A what?
  Made out of toenail?
That's the same thing as hair.
Your nails and your hair   keratin.
Oh! I had no idea.
If we let it just go, eventually, we would have a horn?
Humans can have horns, funnily enough.
There was a late 18th century nun, who grew a horn.
Her nunnery was invaded by Napoleonic troops.
She grew that horn, specifically to ward off people attacking them?
She went, "Let's not get spears and knives..."?
She was locked in an asylum and banged her head, regularly,
against the wall or table and she started to grow a horn.
  It was a most peculiar thing.
  Brilliant! I'm doing it.
Just carry on.
She eventually had it cut off, cos it was going into her eye.
What a waste! She should've had a Bible with a hook on it
and she could've hung it there and then she'd be peeling potatoes,
reading the Bible.
You're right.
They should have that on QVC.
"Are you sick of not being able to read the Bible
"whilst doing domestic duties? Try banging your head off a wall.
"It works for nuns. Eight out of ten nuns prefer it."
That drawing doesn't seem to be the most convincing evidence.
That sounds like there's a picture and someone thought, "I won't do a Hitler moustache.
"I'll stick a horn on her!"
But that looks less like a horn, more like she's put half a croissant.
  It does!
  It's like all that banging...
The Mother Superior should've just said, "Just cut half a croissant."
Little bit of jam and that would've done the job.
Instead, she went, "Dur!" and stabbed herself in the hand.
Is an antler a horn?
  Yes.
  Ah, no.
An antler is different. Why is an antler different?
It's made of wood.
  An antler's different cos it's shed.
  It's shed?
  Yes, every year.
  What do they keep in this shed?
  Ah, no! They shed.
  They keep their antlers in a shed?
I know so little!
  So, when the two horned creatures are going at it...
  Locked.
  When they lock horns.
  Does that ever happen with nuns?
One of them goes, "That's mine." "It's not!"
I'd pay... I'd walk a mile on broken glass to see that.
I'd be there. I'd also pay to hunt them as well.
Imagine that, going on a nun hunt!
Some men fantasise about two nuns locking horns. That's sexy.
That animal on the left, I hope it's called the Mr Whippy goat.
Whoever named it missed a real opportunity.
I doubt it is called the Mr Whippy goat.
It's more of an antelope than a goat.
The animal on the left, would you say that it's evolved
to have some kind of fear of sound?
Yes! They are big receptors.
Aware that perhaps its predators may sneak up on it.
It is blessed, it is a nervous creature.
The Princess Leia of the moose world.
"We'll need bigger ears, cos they're still sneaking up on us."
Those are all proper horns there, on the antelope,
  on the horned toad and on the... What's the other one?
  Buffalo.
  Yes.
  I think the buffalo's horns evolved so nobody took it seriously.
  Yes, they look upside down, or something.
  So sad and pathetic. And then nobody would attack it,
they'd just laugh at it and go, "Oh, you've been lumbered, mate!"
They just evolved living in a field with quite a low gate.
Yes!
Ah, the horns have caught on the gate again.
How comes, over years of evolution, you've got an animal like that,
with those sorts of horns and no animal has developed quoits?
Are you speaking English?
  Did you just say to him, "Are you speaking English?"
  Yeah, I've never heard it.
  Have you never heard a Geordie accent before?
  Not from something with hair that's never been combed.
I'd just point out, I am part of the show. I'm not on the screen.
OK. I thought that was...
You're sat there, going, "What the hell is that thing?"
  I figured you just banged your head, constantly.
  I'll come at you like a nun!
I can see where he's a shock to a delicately nurtured creature.
That's one of the worst threats I've ever heard!
"I'll come at you like a nun!"
"Would you like a sweet?"
I think I've got a new catchphrase now!
Excellent, well, well done everybody.
Many things that we call horns actually aren't.
What would happen if you threw a hippo in the deep end of your local swimming pool?
It would sink.
  It would sink.
  Yeah.
  In the winters, I live in Miami
and they all look like that. But they have lipstick on,
  so nobody would bat an eye.
  They wouldn't.
They walk along the bottom, that's what they do.
That's exactly what they do. What hippos don't do is swim.
But it's not the first thing that would happen.
  You'd get your swimming card revoked, would be the first thing.
  Yes!
Also, Ross, I think there'd be a huge sense of relief
that you'd finally got rid of the hippo,
got through the turnstiles with it, through the changing rooms, and then you think,
"Oh, Christ, at least I've bloody done it!
"Oh, dear, wait till the guys hear about this!"
Probably take the traffic cone off your head.
So, this one would die, cos he's got floaties on.
  And, actually, they need...
  That is a mistake. They can float,
and they can drop to the bottom. What they can't do is swim.
Is do the backstroke.
  Which is why that ident on BBC One, where they swimming in a circle...
  All wrong.
  Factually incorrect.
  They're doing a sort of doggy paddle, aren't they?
  A lot of EastEnders isn't true either.
That's ridiculous!
How, then, do they get out of a river?
A small boy in pyjamas dives in and saves them.
No, they walk along the bottom,
  or bounce and stride...
  Oh, I know!
  They fill their lungs and float to the top.
  No, they just walk to the shallow part.
Sometimes they carry a small thing of helium. They get to the surface,
then just keep going.
  They certainly can't use a ladder!
  No, you're right.
You said that with anger, like, "Bloody hippos!"
Like you've paid a few of them to do some decorating.
And they were just sat round, smoking.
"Can't even use a bloody ladder! I'm sick of it."
The fact is, they just walk up the shallow bit, to get onto land.
That is a good point.
If a hippo did go into a swimming pool
and it didn't have a shallow end, how would it get out?
Probably couldn't. It could certainly float, as you said.
When they sleep, they put just a tiny bit of their nostrils up
so they can breathe and float.
So how many hippos a year die
due to Sean pushing them into swimming pools?
It's a growing problem.
How many teeth does a hippo have?
A full grown one has 40. And the reason I know that's a fact
is I got asked a question by my daughter the other day,
"Dad, how many teeth has a hippo got?"
and I went, "Let's go over to this little bit of equipment here..."
Are you sure you didn't go, "Well, I'd tell you,
"but I just pushed my last one into a swimming pool."
They always have those photos with their massive mouths open,
  and there's two at the top and two at the bottom.
  That's it.
  No.
It said that a full grown hippo has 40, minimum of 40.
  Is that Wikipedia?
  No. No.
It was hippoteeth.com.
Now, the hippo is not afraid of predators sneaking up on it.
No. Smaller ears.
  Tiny little ears, barely needs them.
  That's right.
"What could we hear that would bother us?"
They're very hard to shoot. Why would that be?
  Underwater?
  No, it's their...
  Oh, they've got...
They've got night vision goggles.
  They can go underground? They can fly?
  Their skin.
Their hide is unbelievably thick. Their skin weighs a tonne.
It's a quarter of their whole body weight, is their hide.
It's unbelievably thick. Most bullets would bounce off, or at least fall down, not penetrate.
Don't give him ideas. He's already pushing them into swimming pools!
He's in the water.
Looking at those light patches round the eyes   has it been on a sun bed?
People often think do they get, somehow, sunburn?
  They do.
  They get very red.
And it looks like sunburn to us,
but actually, they give off a red oil.
People genuinely used to think they bled through their skin.
He puts his ears over his eyes, like that, look.
What would that be doing for them?
It keeps their skin moisturised.
Right, well, moving on...
Hippos can't swim, but they can float.
If you threw one in the deep end, it would likely allow itself to sink to the bottom,
before walking to the shallow end. What's the point of having a head like a hammer?
Oh, my LORD!
  Oh, my gracious.
  You mean like a shark?
  Yes, like a shark.
  Like a shark.
I know that one.
When they approach it, I imagine most creatures who approach it
don't recognise it as another creature,
till they get round the side. Whoops, too late!
Or it's pulling a face, then God said,
"If you do that one more time, It's going to stick."
  Their eyes are on the end, aren't they?
  They've got eyes on the end.
It's not fully understood, to be honest,
but it certainly gives it an extraordinary depth perception,
  to have eyes that far apart.
  It's a bottom feeder.
  I like to talk about bottom feeders.
  Do you, Ruby?
  Somebody's got to do it.
  Yep.
They're like hoovers, hoovers of the sea.
They eat flatfish and stingrays that live on the bottom that often camouflage themselves under sand.
How do they detect things that are camouflaged? Not with their eyes.
With their fins. They go like that.
  They have things called...
  Do they smell everything?
They have ampullae. A lot of sharks do.
  And it smells?
  No, they detect electrical movement,
so sensitively that the electrical movement you or I make by operating our muscles,
they could detect that.
And they detect it in a shifting fish.
It seems that gives them a really impressive...
Rather like a sort of long radar antenna.
  So you'd really mess with their heads if you chucked in a toaster?
  Yes!
Cos the trouble with a hammerhead shark is, it's very hard for it to do a double take.
Ooh, me neck!
It's a comic nightmare.
I've just realised what's missing from your average shark.
They haven't got any lips.
No, they haven't.
  That's why they look so hideous.
  It does give them a nasty look.
If you gave them a bit of collagen, a bit of colour, they'd look quite attractive.
They'd come up lovely.
  Much more sinister if a shark came up to you, before it bit you, it went, "Mwah!"
  What about their teeth,
Sean, as you are an expert on animal teeth?
  Yeah. How many teeth?
  Do you know about shark teeth?
Have you got a computer? I can check it for you.
Sharks' teeth are interesting. They have a row of a lot of teeth and then they have rows behind...
  They come forward, when they lose them.
  That's it.
They lose a tooth and another one comes forward, like a conveyer belt.
  With dolphins, sorry to go off of sharks...
  It's fine.
They detect when something's dying.
That's how they figure out to go for it.
I went swimming with one.
They say, "If you have false breasts, don't go in, cos it'll ram you over and over again."
Sometimes kids who are disabled go in,
  and then it nudges them.
  With sharks?
  Not with sharks.
  We're on dolphins.
  Oh, sorry, I missed that.
I thought you were putting disabled kids in with sharks!
I was thinking, "What sort of charity is this?"
I'm going to give them some money!
The reason for that
is everyone thinks they've got this perception and all the rest of it, it's not.
It's because they get in there, they think it's a ball.
The next thing you know, it's up on the nose,
they're going along like that, woman's knocker on the top,
"Uh! Uh! Uh!"
But they always give you instructions.
They always give you a pep talk and say never touch a dolphin underneath its waistline.
Cos they get very excited.
But they extend their penises for a lift. You hold on and they give you a lift.
If they've already got somebody on the top deck.
"Got no room on top, you'll have to go down below."
This is true! These are facts.
I can't help it if I've got an enquiring mind.
They have been known to save people, haven't they?
Nudge people to shore who are in trouble?
There are stories going back to the Ancient Greeks, of course. I've swum with dolphins as well.
It is quite an extraordinary experience.
It's terrible when they reject you.
That's horrible.
All your family and therapists are standing on the beach...
It's freezing cold and there's loads of dolphins,
just pissing off back to the sea.
Then you look round, and you go...
"I suppose we'd better just carry on with the medication, then?"
If they rejected you, Sean...
"I mean, at least we tried."
"Can I have a towel?"
Sean, if they rejected you, it's because you're strong and whole.
They're not interested in fit people.
They're drawn towards the weak and the disadvantaged  
you're clearly totally fit.
I was talking to a marine biologist, who basically said,
"Oh, they're these amazing creatures and you can swim with them.
"Actually, they're a bunch of fighting, rag tag..."
If you see proper wild dolphins, they've got lumps out of them, bits missing...
I love the idea that people are going, "I want this amazing experience..."
Serene and mystical and lyrical...
When actually, it's just like being chucked in with a bunch of wet skinheads.
  Yep.
  Get in there!
And they bully each other. And they attack porpoises.
How do they tell each other apart?
  In the same way that anyone else would!
  No, no.
That's a good question. How do ants tell...
when they meet a beetle, that it's not an ant? How do they know?
You meet a beetle, go, "All right?"
how does it know? Cos they can't see, can they?
Ants can't see.
  Yes, they can!
  Oh, go back to school, Stephen!
Maybe I'm going on the wrong website!
  I think you might've been!
  It's Jordan's Animal Facts I'm going on.
"Ask Jordan." That's where I get my animal information.
How do they learn to do the ballet, the dolphins? You know,
when they go up like a mix master? How do they know how to do that?
Millions of years of practice. Evolution.
Can you imagine the sex with that one? That would be exciting. The Kama Sutra of the dolphin world.
It's not often I find myself in a group of people
thinking I'm the most normal, sane and balanced person there,
but I'm happy to feel that today.
Nobody really knows why hammerheads have such odd heads, but it seems it allows them to detect more food.
Why is it hard to hang on to a hagfish? There's a hagfish.
  I know.
  Yes?
  It releases mucous.
  The hagfish?
  To defend itself,
which works in real life.
If anybody ever comes at me, I just sneeze at them,
  and they back off.
  I don't think you could produce the kind of slime
that a hagfish could produce.
You don't know me. I'm very young and fertile.
Have a look at a hagfish releasing slime and tell me you could produce as much.
That is producing that. It can turn a bucket of 20 litres
of water into slime in minutes.
That's a great party piece.
I actually think... I think my baby daughter might be a hagfish.
Cos that's nothing.
To be honest with you, I've got that on my trousers every morning.
It also can tie itself into knots, which is another impressive thing.
It literally does a slipknot or an overhand knot.
  It's quite bizarre.
  Given the choice,
if I had to have special powers, I'd like to be bitten by one of them.
Because excreting mucous would be...
Spider Man is all very well   do a bit of climbing and that.
Imagine if you were just sat in a chair and someone went, "Do your thing," and you just went...
  That would be fantastic!
  It'd be brilliant.
If somebody tried to get you in a headlock, you'd just go...
Voomf!
  That's what it does.
  Ross, superheroes are meant to help people.
How would you help people with this?
Spider Man helps people. How would you help people with this mucous?
"There's a child, it's got its head in the railings." Vmfff.
"Oh, no! This..."
That one. Or...
Yeah, that's a really good comic book story, isn't it?
This gravy is unnecessarily runny. Vmfff.
  This couple is dry humping.
  Exactly!
Exactly.
Various things.
I'd rather have hippo powers, though.
Cos you're bulletproof, you can run at 35mph and you can walk on the bottom of the deep end
AND you only have to brush four teeth in the morning.
The only trouble with that is your arch nemesis, lock boy,
pushes you into a swimming pool.
"I can't get out!"
That's how they talk.
Hagfish are hard to hold because they tie themselves in a knot and ooze slime in all directions.
How would you collect the snot from a sneezing humpback?
  Is mucous our word of the day?
  No, just linked.
  They sneeze through their blowhole.
  They don't sneeze,
they can't sneeze, but they breathe out. When you see a humpback whale breathing out,
it is breath. It contains mucous.
  So, who collects it?
  A scientist interested in monitoring
the health of a humpback. Why is it important to see whether humpbacks have got colds or flu?
  Because a sick one, you can push it towards the Japanese.
  No, no!
  Because...
Then they go, "Oh, we'll have that one and knock off early."
No, because, like birds, like pigs, they get flu that jumps species to man. And if that flu
  jumps to us, which is possible...
  That'd be a nightmare!
  It's a whole new genetic code.
  Well, not just that.
Think at the waiting room at the doctor's!
You'd be squashed against the wall like that, he'd be there...
When you get bird flu, you don't get all small and grow wings.
To get a flu is not the same as to turn into the animal.
No, but what I'm saying is if that humpback whale has got the flu,
  he's taking up all the chairs...
  Oh, I see!
  All the pensioners and me are pressed against the wall.
We'll have to encourage the whales to ring NHS Direct.
The only trouble with that is, NHS Direct pick up the phone
and think it's a fax machine. HE IMPERSONATES A WHALE
It's true!
"Wrong number again!" and the whale's there, going, "I'm really ill
"and they won't let me come down the doctor's, cos I take up too much room.
"And I keep knocking the posters off the wall, with me barnacle arse."
If I can just guide you away for a moment, towards that snot.
How do you collect it?
With a bag over its head, an ordinary bag from Greggs?
It has to be from Greggs?
  It has to be.
  You put pepper in the hole?
  It started...
Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, her name was, a researcher
who was very much a specialist.
She used to have a Petri dish on the end of a stick
and try to get it through the plume, but it was too difficult.
  There was too much turbulent water.
  She swims next to it?
Originally, but what does she do now? She's got a really good system.
  Big condom over the top of the hole?
  A remote control toy helicopter,
that flies... There.
  There it is, isn't that perfect?
  Collecting it.
If you're going to be a scientist, specialising in collecting snot...
Has she come up with anything?
  Now that she has the collection.
  Good data on the transmission
of flu between humpback whales...
Which is jolly difficult, cos they travel more than any other   5,000 miles a year, routinely.
Trying to get away from the remote control helicopter...
Meehhhhh!
I wouldn't fancy being the bloke who works in her local toy shop either!
"Oh, it's broken again, is it?"
"Yeah, got all mucous in the rotor blades."
You were talking about the carrier bag there. My mate tried to steal
a squid from a sea life centre in a carrier bag.
Seriously, he had it all planned out.
And he got this carrier bag and he said, "I'm going for it this week."
I saw him and he said it was a nightmare   he couldn't find
a carrier bag... You know the safety holes in the bottom?
It leaked water.
He couldn't find one that didn't. And then finally he said, "I've found a hefty one."
This is the honest to God truth. He had a tank ready,
he knew which sea life centre he was going to steal it from.
He got the bag. He glued up the holes with Sellotape and superglue.
And just as he was about to do it, he was committed.
I saw him. I said, "Did you get it?" He said, "No." "So what happened?"
He went, "The handles broke."
He put it in the water, and it was too heavy.
Why was he so committed to a carrier bag? Why not a squid catching bag?
What about a normal fishing net?
On the end of a bamboo cane.
But he had to get it home on the bus.
So, people who do research into whale flu collect snot using remote control toy helicopters.
Now, imagine you're taking a hamster on holiday.
How can you make sure it doesn't get jet lag?
Yes, Ross.
Holiday in England.
You don't have to stay in England,
you just have to stay in the same time zone.
If they're in the cage and theyre moving that way, and the plane is moving that way...
This isn't my area. Doesn't it balance out in space and time?
No, it doesn't quite work.
  But it's a nice thought.
  Is there an answer to this?
  There is.
They have experimented on hamsters and jet lag. They've not actually...
See, look how cute. As a woman, I want to nurse it.
But you pay for it and you realise it does...nothing.
You watch these guinea pigs in G Force   they're like fighting,
climbing, firing guns, saving people.
You go home and you see them sitting there   lazy, useless.
Just like a furry scrounger.
You get out there and do something.
Can you put your head in a hole like that? I don't think so.
And they drop pellets. They do a lot of things.
The thing is, Sean, he MADE that wooden thing.
Just by nosing it.
I was visiting a friend's house, and on the upstairs landing, I had gone to the loo and came out.
It was a summer's day, and there was a big open window over the lawn.
There was a football, and I kicked it through the window, and the child burst into tears.
  It had a hamster in it.
I'd never seen such a thing. These balls that youput hamsters in.
It was terrible!
It was actually fine. It was a little dizzy. But...
Exhilarated, I'd have thought.
Who o o o o o oa!
At last! Someone's done it!
Don't take me back in, no!
  It was most unfortunate.
  Melatonin. You give it melatonin.
It's not melatonin. It IS a drug. A surprising one   it's a common drug.
  Temazepam?
  Not Temazepam, not paracetamol.
I'm sure you haven't taken it. You're too young and virile.
  Viagra.
  Right answer.
Viagra appears to recover from jet lag as long as it's eastward bound jet lag. That's the weird thing.
Jet lag's a lot worse when you're travelling east.
It's a lot better when you're travelling west. So if you go to America, you recover better
than when you come back home   it takes you longer to recover.
Good. Excellent. Jet lagged hamsters can have their symptoms alleviated by giving them Viagra.
What gives honeybees a real buzz?
  Is it the smoke they blow into the hive?
  That gives them the opposite
of a buzz. That pacifies them. Do you know why the smoke is used?
The smoke alarms them so much, that they think someone's attacking the hive. They eat all their honey.
And they just get bloated. They don't have any aggressive...
That's actually what's happening, rather than smoke getting into their lungs or anything.
I'm really glad now that I've been bitten by a radioactive hagfish and not a radioactive bee.
Cos that'd be a nightmare if you were a half human bee. Somebody has a fag and you go, "Where's the honey?"
  Bees speak... Speak isn't quite the word.
  They do like the hula
to show where to go. So we know what they're doing.
We can read their dances... their waggles,
because they're telling each other
how far away their nearest good source is and where it is.
It's been studied for over 100 years.
And we can tell exactly what it is they're saying.
And what's interesting... Don't know who did this.
If you give them cocaine, they exaggerate.
They claim there's more honey than there is. Yeah.
They overdo it, they get boastful, essentially.
And tell stories that never end.
It seems to have a similar effect on them as it does on humans.
  And do they all go off and get a job in advertising?
  Ha!
And lose their appetite and so on.
  But actually the strange thing about bees is...
  They take your blood.
85% of all bee species are loners. They don't live in colonies and only
a tiny fraction   I think it's 20 out of the thousands of species
are honeybees. Most bees aren't honeybees.
But one of the most interesting bees, you'll love this piece of film, is the Japanese honeybee,
which has developed a fabulous way of attacking hornets who try and get
into their... Watch this. You'll love this. There's the hornet.
And it's killing the individuals. It's vicious.
But look, they make a bee ball.
Yes, I've seen this. They suffocate them, don't they?
More than suffocate. There's so much heat generated in this ball,
they literally boil the hornet.
It gets bigger and bigger. You wouldn't want that to happen to you.
It's frightening.
Mucous would be so much better.
Yeah.
  Wow!
  Isn't that stunning?
  You're asking for trouble.
  That hornet is an ex hornet.
  75% of all fruit on the planet is pollinated by...
  Bees.
  Bats.
  Ahh.
Actually, bats are far more responsible...
  Walked into that one.
  Yes, you did.
It's like You've Been Framed with a cake and a glass door.
Doof!
To be fair,
bat honey is horrible.
  Yes!
Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.
When bees take drugs they behave much like humans  
they dance around manically and exaggerate about their lives.
That was a question about Hymenoptera
As is this: What am I describing here?
Pure, intense, brilliant pain,
like fire walking over flaming charcoal
  with a three inch rusty nail in your heel.
  Childbirth.
  Probably!
Probably.
Is it a bee sting?
There is a man, called Schmidt,
who has devoted his life to creating the Schmidt scale of insect bite or sting pain.
He has been bitten or stung by just about every stinging, biting insect there is.
And he writes rather wine connoisseur descriptions...
Ow! There, look at that. ..of the pain.
It starts at 1.0 and goes up to plus 4.0,
the one we just heard   the bullet ant. It starts with the sweat bee,
which you can see on the left there.
That's light, ephemeral, almost fruity,
a tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm.
  Notes of blackberry.
  Yes, exactly. Leather and tobacco!
Is 10.0 like listening to Westlife?
Then 1.8 is the bullhorn acacia ant,
"A rare, piercing, elevated sort of pain, someone has fired a staple into your cheek."
  He's done these things to make a comparison?
  I guess he has.
Then there's the bald faced hornet, rich, hearty, slightly crunchy,
similar to your hand being mashed in a revolving door.
That's a very good thing to document.
Then there's a yellowjacket, "Imagine WC Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue."
Specifically WC Fields?
Just go, "Oh, that one, it's more like Jimmy Savile.
"No, no, that's WC Fields."
Number three...
Did you see that documentary
where the guy was into being bitten by snakes?
I Was Bitten, that's what it was called.
  I Was Bitten.
  Yeah, he was really...
It was a pleasurable thing so he went for bigger and bigger and harder and harder.
He was getting almost a kind of buzz out of it rather than pain.
  So how do you know this guy isn't?
  Well, he may be. But it's
the paper wasp, caustic, burning, distinctly bitter aftertaste,
like spilling a beaker of hydrochloric acid on a paper cut.
That's nasty. Then there's the bullet ant,
which is the one I described,
Pure, intense, brilliant pain... It's called the bullet ant, cos it's like getting shot. There it is.
A nasty piece of work. Anyway, yes.
They fact is entymologist Justin Schmidt has been stung by almost every insect
and describes the bullet ant sting as the most painful on Earth,
what is the world's most aggressive mammal?
My mother.
  Is it one of those three?
  No, it isn't. It isn't.
The rhino.
No, the rhino's not in the least...
Not a mammal either.
A rhino is a mammal, yes.
I thought it was a dinosaur.
Why's it called a rhino saurus then, if it's not a dinosaur.
Because it's not.
It's called a rhino saurus, that's what dinosaurs are called.
It's rhinoceros is it not?
Noceros.
Have you been calling it a rhino saurus?
Yeah!
There's the problem.
Jordan!
When I get home...!
Yep.
Really? That was genuine stupidity.
Walking into the glass door of stupidity.
Always welcome. Sorry about that.
Does it begin with H?
Yes it does. It used to be known as the ratel
but it now seems to be more well know as the something beginning with H.
  Hyena?
  Not a hyena, no.
Horse.
No!
It is a really savage animal.
It's first word is something we were discussing with bees.
The honey badger.
Very good, someone in the audience gets 10 points for honey badger.
On the subject of...
It's not about being a badger but you know what annoys me
is the term, to badger somebody.
Badgers don't actually badger.
If you badgered somebody you wouldn't be hounding them all the time,
you'd move into their garden and sleep a lot...
And be incredibly shy.
And just emerge when Bill Oddie stuck a camera in your face.
That's the way u badger somebody and it's about time it changed.
That's an incredibly fair point.
  Actually, the honey badger isn't a true badger either.
  I did say that.
Yes you did, I thought you did.
I might be an idiot, but I'm an accurate idiot.
You are, and well done for knowing that. It just reminded the first people who saw it
because of the colouring, but it's not connected.
And they are staggeringly aggressive.
They attack anything. Lions, humans, hyenas,
and they have huge claws for their size so they can do an immense amount of damage.
Do you know which part of a mammal,
including a man, that they will attack?
I imagine the nethers.
Yes, the testicles is the right answer. That's what they go for.
They oooft like that.
There are stories of them attacking buffalo.
How do they know where the testicles are?
It'll be on different animals in different areas.
I don't know about you but when I'm exploring,
when I'm exploring everybody knows.
I explore like this.
With chaps on...no pants.
I'll tell you what though,
badger honey is so much worse than bat honey.
  Yes.
The first account of it was an adult buffalo being castrated by one of these things.
Scientific American said in 2009 that pound for pound
the honey badger is the world's most fearsome land mammal
because it's so aggressive and had such big claws.
Why aren't they in charge then?
Yeah.
Why are we in charge and not them?
Because we temper our aggression sometimes with altruism,
knowledge, cognitive faculties...
No, Stephen, it's bombs.
Yes!
And also we worked out how to make security pants.
So when them honey badgers come up... Argh...
They're frustrated.
They can't get at the balls.
Are they quite small?
Yeah, relatively small, yeah.
About yay big.
And do they eat honey?
  Yes!
  They do.
They do eat honey!
What sort of honey badger is it?
Is it a south London honey badger?
I might have a look at that. Cover your balls, he's coming out.
Have some of that.
It's certainly part of their diet because they famously use...
what do they use to find the honey?
  Their noses.
  No.
  Another animal.
  A bird.
A bird called the honey guide.
Hmm.
  guide that's a bird.
  You are so hot now, for me.
It's learned to co operate with the badger.
It can see where the hive is and it hovers over it and makes the noise,
the badger goes in and opens it up the bird gets it reward
by sharing the honey and the badger won't attack it.
But they'll also do that for humans.
They'll lead humans to hives so that you can get honey.
  That's a fact, you're right there.
  These guys?
I'll tell you a secret, I've actually got Jordan
on a little thing and she's telling me this stuff straight into my ear.
Oh, that's why you're doing so well.
So who don't the police use them for riot situations?
How funny would that be? Cos... Oh, hello!
  It is pretty savage isn't it?
  Because the police dog, you know,
a lot of the time the police dog is there, grrrr,
and everyone's going, oh, it's a dog, I might out run it,
but if you held up... Got a honey badger, get them balls ready.
Spread 'em!
If you castrate every peace demonstrator,
that's probably not a way forward.
The police dogs are trained to bark if they hear someone say bastards.
  What about blagard, villain?
  Villain, yeah.
You can have a bit of fun, like if you go to a country show
and they're doing a demonstration... Bastard! Grrrr!
Moving on. Very good though.
As the honey badger constituency in our audience knew,
the most aggressive mammal is probably the honey badger.
When attacking humans they supposedly go for the testicles,
which brings us face to face with the vicious predator of general ignorance.
Fingers on buzzers, please. I have some points available for you.
All you have to do is to identify every animal in front of you.
  Hedgehog, mouse...
  You've not done well to start with.
  Not a hedgehog?
Is one of them a bilby?
There's no bilbies there. And there's no mouse there.
  A shrew?
  A shrew?
  A buffalo?
  Shrew?
  No, there is no shrew.
Let's have a look again.
Let's see them again.
  A mole?
  Is that a baby mole?
They're all different species of one kind of animal.
Dog.
No! Not a dog.
  Think of a place where species have evolved...
  New Zealand?
  Like New Zealand.
  G G G G... Galapagos!
  No.
But it is an island. It's Madagascar. In Madagascar,
a few mammals, millions of years ago,
were hived off from Africa and the evolved separately.
They filled niches similar to those in Europe
and this particular animal is known as a tenrec
and it is...various species of it.
They fill the same niches as hedgehogs do.
They're not in any way connected or related to hedgehogs.
They have just solved the problems of existence in the same way.
Plants that have done the same. There are things you would swear blind are a cactus,
  but are not in any way a cactus.
  A bogus?
  Yes! Exactly.
So, the tenrec is a Madagascan mammal
that has evolved over millions of years
to create species that look like mice, shrews and hedgehogs.
Now, what are these animals fighting about?
FOGHORN BLARES They're not fighting?
Hmm...
  They're just, er...
  Sparring?
  Trying to get...   Trying to do a high five,
but they can't get it together.
They do it in springtime, when they're getting a bit frisky.
It's two males fighting over a girl?
  Ohhh, Ruby!
How bad can it get? It doesn't matter now.
  Go for it now.
  What do I know?
A hare's got no chance of having sex with a girl. Has to be another hare, surely?
A girl hare!
Girl is way out of their league.
  They might get a kiss off a girl.
  It's not two males fighting.
It is a female fighting off a male who is too frisky.
She's basically saying she's not up for it.
It's basically watching a rape.
Well...
  You're watching a female stopping a rape.
  That's Distur...
I mean you have a go at me, but that's sick!
  Give him the mucus!
  Get some pepper spray!
  Maybe that would happen.
When two hares box, it's more than likely that a female is boxing away
an overexcited male she doesn't want to mate with. And finally,
what is rhino horn used for in traditional Chinese medicine?
  What do you want us to say?
  You've finally got wise.
I will let you off the hook. It has never been used as an aphrodisiac.
It is a fallacy.
It's used, supposedly, to keep fevers at bay.
It makes no more sense at keeping fevers at bay
than it does as an aphrodisiac,
because it is, as we discussed earlier, simply hair.
Like these folk that bite their nails.
  Chinese medicine is bollocks.
  Yes.
That's Jordan.
She said, g...g...bollocks.
Load of old... sh...tit.
She says,
If Chinese medicine is so good...
why do they build hospitals.
God bless her.
No, I can't say that Jordan!
Oh, dear.
It isn't true, rhino horn is not used as an aphrodisiac in traditional Chinese medicine,
it's most often taken for a fever.
Which brings us all the way back to our horns and, indeed,
to the end of the show. Let's have a look at the scores.
Goodness gracious me.
The dominant male this evening, on seven points, is Ross Noble!
And in second place, with a highly respectable  5,
Sean Lock and Jordan!
Thank you. Thank you.
And really improving now,  6, Alan Davies!
  Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm afraid at the very bottom of the food chain,
as thick as two short planktons,
I leave you with this piece of wisdom from Homer Simpson  
"Weaselling out of things is important to learn.
"It's what separates us from the animals,
"except the weasel." Thank you and good night.
