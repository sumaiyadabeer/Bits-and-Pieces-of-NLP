Welcome to Copycats
with your hosts, Sam and Mark
and today's Copycats are:
Sophie's team from Cambridgeshire,
and Joshua's team from Bedfordshire.
All right!
Yes!
Hello!
And welcome to Copycats the game show where, unlike in a music exam,
copying the person next to you is positively encouraged.
In fact it could bag you the ultimate money can't buy prize.
You can forget the World Cup, Wimbledon,
even me going to the same school as Michael Parkinson.
It's true you know.
  It is true!
  Yes, even that, because today's teams
will be playing for the greatest prize in game show history.
It is...the Copycats trophy!
Oooh!
  Shall we meet today's Copycats?
  Let's do it.
  All right.
Sophie, team captain, plant it right there. How you doing?
  I'm feeling good.
  Yeah, all right!
Team, you feeling good? Yeah!
OK, we're get to know you guys a little bit better,
so we're going to take a look at your audition tape.
What a fantastic audience, that was better than last week!
Well the best of luck for today   it's Sophie's team everybody.
OK, and over here we've got Joshua's team.
How you doing mate?
Yeah, good thanks, cos we're going to win it.
All right! That's a confident start!
Looking forward to seeing your audition tape?
Steve's going, "No, Mark, don't show it!" Got to I'm afraid,
let's have a look.
She's like Michael Jackson!
When is the best time to buy a chicken?
  Don't know.
  When they're going cheap.
Ha ha! Best of luck to you. Joshua's team, everyone.
Nice one.
It looks like our teams are ready to start copying
as with every game of Copycats
the teams will take it in turns to copy pictures, actions,
and displays of Musical genius.
In order to get as many points as possible each team will face
the Copycats Challenge a bit later on.
We tossed a coin earlier so Sophie's team are playing first.
Let's play Copycats!
OK, Sophie's team I hope you've been brushing up on your artistic skills
because it's time to play Quick on the Draw  
after saying "No, I've not!"
Here's what's going to happen, Afton.
I've got three cards, you're going to pick one
and you will have ten seconds to draw what's on that card
to the person next to you which is Sophie, and so on down the line.
There's a maximum of 50 points to be won
but as we pass it back down the line,
you'll lose ten of those points for every incorrect answer.
Copycats, are you ready?
Yes! In that case,
let's close the doors
Pick a card, we've got pink, blue or yellow.
  OK, I'll go for blue.
  Take a look.
  Reckon you can draw that?
  I'm going to give it my best shot, yeah!
That's all we ask of you! Best of luck.
Pick up your pen, don't want to waste any time. You've got ten seconds.
Ready, steady, draw.
What the heck is that?
OK, Sophie's turn.
It's not bad.
Um...
OK, Joanne your turn.
Charlotte, your turn.
OK, David, your turn.
Times up, stop drawing!
Lucy, for 50 points, what's the answer we're looking for?
Donald the duck?
It's not Donald Duck.
OK, we're playing for 40 points open the door please.
David, what do you reckon, mate?
  Easter eggs?
  Nice thinking, it's not Easter eggs though,
which means we're playing for 10 points.
  Charlotte.
  Headphones.
Good thinking, it's not headphones though
which means we're playing for 20 points. What do you reckon?
Daffy Duck?
Going through all the ducks.
It's not Daffy Duck, which means we're playing for 10 points.
Come on, Sophie.
  Are they fish?
  Fish? It's not fish.
Joanne you just said you think you know what it is now, go on?
  Are they ballet shoes?
  They are!
That means at the end of Quick on the Draw you get no points
but give them a round of applause anyway.
OK, Karen, I've got two colours left, a yellowy gold and a pink.
Going to go for pink.
  Yeah?
Got that? All right.
Get your pen ready, don't want to waste time.
Ready, steady, draw. Open the door.
Remember, ten seconds is not a long time.
OK, Joshua.
Fantastic drawing.
Remember, not a lot of time.
OK, Jason.
OK, Isabella, try and get as much detail in there...
Ten seconds is not a long time.
OK, time to spare, all right.
Keep watching, Nathan. Keep watching.
Not bad.
OK, stop drawing please.
All right, Nathan, for a maximum of 50 points,
what is the correct answer we're looking for here?
A frightened person?
Ha ha! Um, it is not a frightened person.
Please open the door for 40 points.
What has Isabella drawn?
  A dummy?
  It is not a dummy.
  OK, for 30 points.
  Is it a model?
Oh, it's not a model.
Come on, you know this you can get come points here.
Is it a scarecrow?
Get in there!
You get yourselves 20 points, well done.
Ah!
So, after Quick on the Draw
have Sophie's team landed a part in Swan Lake?
And like a scarecrow have Joshua's team
managed to frighten the opposition?
  Let's look at the scored. Mr D, what could they be? You all right?
  yep.
Well, mark, after Quick on the Draw,
Sophie's team have no points
and Joshua's team have 20 points.
The next round will test our teams' skill, nerve and determination.
Yes, the game just got serious,
cos this is the Copycats Challenge.
As Sophie's team won the toss before the show, they will go first.
Joshua's team, so you don't get a sneaky peek at what's coming up
we are going to send you off but you are coming back
  so say goodbye to Joshua's team.
  See you later. Keep it real!
Sophie, as team captain you need to select three people
to face the mind blowing Copycats challenge.
But before that, let's see what's in store. Mr D, what could it be?
The Puzzle.
an image of a completed puzzle will be displayed on the screen.
You must copy this image by sliding the tiles into position.
Ten points will be awarded for every square in the correct place
when the time runs out.
AND Best of luck, Sophie's team.
In three, two, one, slide.
So first, check on the screen,
see what the finished puzzle should look like.
You don't have to complete this puzzle,
but if you do, the more points you score.
10 points for every tile in the correct position
when the time runs out.
Sophie, Afton, Charlotte,
playing this game.
Team members who are not playing, offering advice from the sidelines  
including Lucy there.
Lucy's probably played this game many times.
Could be an expert. Why's she not playing then?
Quickly as you can.
The time flies by.
No crawling over the puzzle, it's not allowed.
You just talk to each other and they're doing lots of that.
Work together as a team,
and you'll succeed.
Come on, keep these tiles moving.
10 points for every tile in the right place remember.
Come on.
Don't delay.
You've got 30 seconds left.
Half a minute left... Oh, a flurry of activity there.
Well done, Afton.
Not sure what that achieved.
It's not bad, actually.
You can see the completed puzzle bottom left of your screen.
And they're not doing too badly, are they?
Which is very good. Ten seconds left!
Oh, bit of indecision there,
black goes up, then the yellow across
and yes, look at the row of yellows at the bottom, very good.
Stop! OK!
Very good! Come over here, guys.
It was very good, that.
I can reveal that you actually got
13 puzzle pieces in the right place!
We will add those challenge points
to your total right after the music round.
Now, Joshua's team still need to face the Copycats Challenge.
Remember the points from these challenges
could make all the difference
cos a dream ticket to the ball room is at stake.
Welcome back Joshua's team   let's play Mime Time.
Now, Joshua, I've got three cards in my hand.
You're going to pick one of these cards,
you're then going to have ten seconds to mime
whatever is on that card
for the player next to you which is Jason, and so on.
There is a maximum of 50 points here
so if you think you know the answer,
try and add more detail so the mime goes to the end of the line
  Copycats, are you ready?
  Yeah!
Fantastic, let's close the doors!
All right, we've got three card here. We've got a yellowy gold,
blue or pink, which would you like?
  This one.
  OK, yellowy gold.
  Yeah? Got that?
  Yeah.
  Good luck to you.
Ready, steady, mime! Open the door!
OK, Jason.
Good.
All right. Go on, Isabella.
Go on, Steve.
Good, aren't they?
All right, Nathan.
All right! Stop miming!
I'm shattered watching that. All right, Karen,
for a maximum of 50 points, what's the correct answer?
  He's in a race and winning it.
  Yes, get in there!
Fantastic.
Joshua's team get 50 points. Well done.
OK, we've got two cards left. Pink or blue?
  Blue.
  Blue? Take a look.
  Reckon you can do that?
  Yes.
  Good.
You've got ten seconds. Best of luck. Ready, steady, mime!
OK. Joanne, your turn.
OK! Charlotte.
David, your turn.
Lucy.
Time's up!
OK. Afton, for 50 points, what's the answer we're looking for?
I'm going to go for balancing on a beam.
Balancing on a beam? It's not.
Which means we'll play for 40 points. Lucy?
  Surfboarding?
  It wasn't surfboarding.
Which means we're playing for 30 points. David?
Skiing?
We have to be a bit more specific. Very close, though.
OK, we're playing for 20 points. Charlotte?
Snowboarding?
It's not, which means we're playing for the minimum of 10 points.
  I didn't hear what he said.
  He said skiing.
Downhill skiing, snow skiing.
It's not.
  Sophie, do you want to tell everybody?
  Water skiing.
Water skiing!
So, sadly, that means, at the end of Mime Time,
you don't get any points, but give them a round of applause.
So, after Mime Time, have Joshua's team taken gold
in the Olympic, World and Commonwealth Games?
And have Sophie's team broken all records
by skiing up the Thames in a pyramid formation?
Mr D, what could those scores be?
Well, Sam, after Mime Time, Sophie's team still have 0 points,
Joshua's team have 70 points.
It's time to get serious once again.
Joshua's team are about to face the Copycats Challenge.
Earlier, Sophie's team scored some important points in their challenge,
but did they do enough? Joshua,
  it's your chance to add some points to your overall score. Ready?
  Yeah.
  Calm, I like that.
  He's calm but calculated.
Sophie's team, it's time to say goodbye.
Go and get a cheese and ham toastie. Off you go! See you later.
Joshua, you need to select three people
to face the Copycats Challenge, but before that,
you get to look at what's in store for you. Mr D, what could it be?
The Puzzle. As before, an image of a completed puzzle
will be displayed on the screen.
You must copy this image by sliding the tiles into position.
10 points will be awarded for every correct square
when the time runs out.
Good luck. In three, two, one, slide!
So, they look at the screen, take in the completed puzzle.
The aim is to get as many of these in the right place as possible.
Same puzzle as for Sophie's team earlier, to make it fair.
An equal test for the two teams.
Quickly as you can, guys.
Time will soon run out.
Jason, who's directing operations.
Well done, Jason. It's exactly how to do it.
You mustn't crawl across the Puzzle itself.
A lot of movement, and advice and instructions from Nathan.
He knows what he's doing.
Why's he not playing the Puzzle, then?
Come on!
A lot of hard work by Jason.
Got this game, by the look of it.
Pushes the red across so that Joshua can put it in place.
Come on, guys!
Yellow...
20 seconds. Get as many tiles in the correct place as possible.
10 points for each one in the correct position.
Look at this! It's fast, but are we achieving our goal?
We shall find out in a few seconds' time. Come on! Wow!
Go, go, go!
That's it. Stop.
Time's up. OK.
It's harder than it looks, isn't it?
  It's really difficult.
  It is.
I can confirm that you got seven pieces in the right place.
Only one round before we add those Challenge points to your total
because we like to keep you guys guessing here. Round of applause.
Welcome back, Sophie's team. This is the Music Round. Joanne,
all you have to do is pick a well known tune
and recreate that tune using the Copycats kazoo.
Charlotte, you need to listen very carefully
as you'll be the one passing the tune down the line.
As usual, there is a maximum of 50 points up for grabs,
so perfect playing means perfect points.
Could everybody except Joanne put your headphones on
so you don't hear which song's been selected? OK.
Let's close the doors.
Joanne, got three tunes here. We've got yellow, pink or blue.
  I'll go with Sophie's favourite colour   pink.
  Take a look.
  Do you know that song?
  No.
  No?
Don't worry, cos we're going to play it into the studio!
We'll play it, so get the melody in your head
and then you can recreate it, hopefully. Let's hear it.
Sound familiar?
No...
Oh, dear. Best of luck.
Three, two, one, play!
SHE BLOWS FAINTLY Ohh, wow!
All right!
Lucy!
SHE PLAYS "Here Comes The Bride"
Time's up!
Wow.
Sophie, for 50 points, what do you think the answer is?
  Congratulations.
  It's not.
Thank you for guessing. Come here. Thank you for guessing!
OK. We're playing for 40 points. Open the door, please.
  I'm going to go for Abba, Dancing Queen.
  It's not.
Thanks again. Thanks again for giving it a shot.
  OK. We're playing for 30 points. Lucy?
No. I don't know what it is, but it's not that! Thanks for trying.
  OK. Dave?
  Yeah?
We're playing for 20 points. Any idea?
Was it Swan Lake?
It wasn't Swan Lake.
  Do you want to hug it out?
  Yeah.
  Come on, then. Thanks for trying.
OK, we're playing for the minimum of 10 points.
Charlotte, I reckon you're going to get the right answer.
Eenie Meenie by Justin Bieber.
It's not. Thanks for trying!
It's not. OK, Joanne, do you want to tell everybody what it is?
  In My Head.
  In My Head by Jason Derulo. Let's hear it.
Sadly, you don't get any points,
but I don't care, cos I had a laugh.
Give them a round of applause.
OK, Jason, I've got two cards left. I've got blue or yellow.
He's right there with the blue.
  Any idea?
  I've got it.
Oh, right. We're going to have a listen to it in the studio anyway.
Theme to The A Team
Ah, yeah!
Best of luck. Ready, steady, play! Open the door.
OK. Isabella.
Go on, Steve.
OK, Nathan.
Awesome. OK, Karen.
Stop playing!
OK, Joshua,
for a maximum of 50 points, what's the answer we're looking for?
Was it Superman?
Ooh, it was not Superman. OK, let's open the door for 40 points.
  Karen?
  Living On A Prayer.
It's not the answer we're looking for. OK, for 30 points, Nathan?
  Indiana Jones.
  Indiana Jones, with conviction, but it's wrong!
20 points   Steve?
My Old Man's A Dustman.
Is he?
  Last time I saw him.
  So's mine! But it's wrong, I'm afraid.
Let's open the door for ten points. Isabella, any idea?
  California Girls?
  California Girls by Katy Perry? It is not. Jason?
  The A Team.
  The A Team! Of course!
Theme to The A Team
De de deh
De de de de, de, de!
You don't get any points,
but that was a good game. Round of applause.
So, after three rounds,
Sophie's team have finished with 0 points
and Joshua's team have 70 points.
Both teams have tried hard to score points...
What are you laughing at?
..but we still have to reveal the scores from the Copycats Challenge.
Which team powered through the Puzzle
  and which team have a ticket to the Copycats ball room?
  The wait is over.
One team got 70 points and one team got 130 points,
which means the team going through to the Copycats ball room is...
..Joshua's team!
Commiserations, Sophie's team! Now, listen.
I know that you did DREADFULLY well in the booths,
but there was only 10 points in it
because you did so well in the Puzzle. Have you had a good day?
  Yes.
  Excellent. It's been great having you on. It's Sophie's team!
Joshua's team, congratulations, you've made it this far
but now it's time to compete for the money can't buy,
lovely, shiny, springy thing that is this  
the Copycats trophy!
Woo ooo!
  I get to hold it   it's great!
  Yes!
  Now, here is the ball room.
  Joshua, who have you chosen to play?
  Nathan, myself and Karen.
Good luck to you. Before we open the doors,
let's look at what you have to do to win this. Bouncy!
The ball room.
Players are each assigned a colour. They must catch 12 of their colour
and deposit them in the scoring cylinders before time runs out.
Good luck!
All right. So, if you're ready, in three, two, one, blast the balls!
Off we go, then.
12 of each colour in the scoring cylinders, please!
Catching the blue balls, it's Karen. Nathan's yellow and Joshua's Red.
Quickly as you can, guys.
There we are. A yellow one goes in.
That's good. Particularly on the yellow and the red.
Nathan and Joshua working well. Come on, catch the balls.
Don't just stand there!
Quickly as you can.
This is high scoring already. Nathan yellow, Joshua red.
Karen a little bit behind with the blue ones,
although she's now making up for it. A whole handful there!
This is very good.
20 seconds to go. You're almost there. Yellow's finished,
which means Nathan can help the others. You're almost there!
You've done it!
Congratulations, Joshua's team. You did it with half an hour to spare(!)
Really quick. Which means, Joshua, your team are the Copycats champions.
  I think you know what I'm going to say.
  What?
It's the end of the show.
Shut your face, one half of Sam and Mark!
I will! We'll see you next time on Copycats!
