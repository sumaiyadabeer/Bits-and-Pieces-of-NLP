even stopping us on the streets,
and the message could not be clearer.
Things weren't right, it was costing me time and money,
and it was like, "Does anybody listen?"
Unfortunately, I think these companies are more motivated
You've told us, that with money tighter than ever,
you need to be sure that every pound you spend is worth it.

Your stories, your money. This is Rip Off Britain
Hello and welcome to Rip Off Britain, where today we're asking
a question that doesn't always produce the answer that it should.
And that is just how much do the companies to whom
we hand over our money really have our best interests at heart?
Because sometimes it seems they just want to get the job done
and move on to the next.
Or they may be in such a hurry for the next payment
they make you feel their priority isn't you or giving you
the best deal or service, but simply getting hold of your money.
And that's certainly how it feels to some of the people whose stories we'll hear today.
They say they're not being listened to  
particularly, when things have gone wrong, or there's been a mistake.
So the question is, are they right? Well, we'll soon find out.
Coming up, how a cupboard's hidden secrets have cost this couple £20,000.
I walked into the cupboard
and as I walked over to the chipboard flooring,
my foot fell straight through the chipboard.
And a family that spent almost £900 on a unique memorial...
I had my heart ripped out when Danielle died.
It's so important for me to get to the bottom of  of all of this.
If you're lucky enough to have a guarantee
for work that's been done on your home,
you'd think it would be obvious what it entitles you to.
But that's not always the case.
Sometimes, the guarantee you've pinned your hopes on
is no longer worth the paper it's written on.
I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night.
When amateur singer Adrienne Guthrie was looking for a new place
to live last year, Wetherby in Yorkshire seemed the obvious choice.
The previous winter
I had been quite isolated following an accident in York.
And so I looked for a property near friends
and because most of the activities I'm involved in, ladies' choir
and one or two other activities, are in Wetherby.
Adrienne had no trouble finding her ideal home.
She was sent a stack of paperwork to go with the purchase,
and amongst it was some very good news...or so she thought.
I saw that there was a guarantee for the double glazing
for a ten year period.
Double glazing had been installed less than two years earlier.
So with eight years left on the guarantee for all her windows
and doors, Adrienne was delighted.
Especially as it soon became clear that her double glazing
wasn't keeping the house as warm as she'd expected.
I hadn't been in the house very long when I realised the kitchen was cold
and as the cold weather came it was like being in an icebox in there.
Adrienne traced the problem to the kitchen door
which didn't seem to have been fitted properly.
But she was reassured by the fact she had that ten year guarantee.
I wasn't unduly worried, I thought that the double glazing
would be covered under the guarantee
and it would just be repaired from that.
So Adrienne contacted the company who'd issued the guarantee,
Orion Windows Limited,
and got a nasty surprise.
They told her the guarantee was no good to her
because it was only valid for the customer who'd installed the glazing.
In other words, the house's previous owner.
I just couldn't believe it.
And I spoke to loads of people,
both people that I meet on a day to day basis
and people in the building trade,
and nobody could understand why the guarantee wasn't transferrable
from one owner to the next and why it didn't stay with the house.
And to make matters worse,
just a few weeks after hearing her guarantee wasn't valid,
there was another problem with Adrienne's double glazing.
I suddenly heard three loud cracks.
And when I went into the back bedroom,
the window had cracked from top to bottom.
It was very cold outside and I'm assuming it was because of the cold.
So with two double glazing problems in just two months,
you can see why Adrienne was annoyed at the prospect of shelling out
for repairs that   because she had that guarantee  
she believed should be done for free.
I don't understand why the guarantee doesn't transfer from owner to owner.
It's just ridiculous the way it's just null and void.
If the previous owner still lived here
they would be able to claim on it.
In fact, double glazing suppliers aren't under any obligation
to supply transferable guarantees  
unless that is, they're members of the industry trade body, the Glass and Glazing Federation.
In that case, they ARE supposed to honour guarantees
if the house changes hands.
And funnily enough, Orion Windows IS a member.
So we asked them why they've refused to follow
the Glass and Glazing Federation's guidelines,
which would mean they'd transfer the guarantee to Adrienne AND carry out the necessary repairs.
And when we did, there was an about turn!
They told us although no problems had previously been identified
with the glazing, they'll be making an appointment
with Adrienne to assess what works need doing.
And crucially, they WILL now be transferring the unexpired portion
of their guarantee to her.
We also spoke to the Glass and Glazing Federation,
who reiterated that it's a mandatory requirement for ALL their members
to provide transferrable guarantees.
But it seems Orion Windows Limited may not be the only company
that hasn't always stuck to the guidelines.
We contacted the 20 Glass and Glazing Federation members
closest to where Adrienne lives to see if they offered transferrable guarantees.
And four of them said they didn't.
We've passed that information on to the Federation,
who've said they'll be reminding all their members of their obligations on this.
Meanwhile, Adrienne's delighted her situation is now resolved.
It will make things a lot easier for me,
but I think people should remember that they need to pay attention
to all the terms and conditions
and make sure that they understand the legal aspects of these things.
If you want to check if your windows
are covered by a transferrable guarantee
or whether you might end up in the same situation as Adrienne,
then there are details on what to do on our website:
Well, I'm sure that, over the last year, most of us would have liked
to have seen a lot less rain, but if you've got a leaky roof
then you'll have found it particularly frustrating.
Peter Dobson certainly has,
and when you hear what it is that's caused his roof to leak,
you'll understand just why he's so annoyed.
When Peter Dobson retired at the end of last year,
he decided to make some additions to the family home in Northumberland.
And top of the list was a traditional wood burning stove.
It's great when it's on   it's warm, it creates a friendly look,
Plus, of course, it keeps the bills down.
It reminds me of my childhood
when my grandmother had one of these open stove things
and she used to boil water on it and stuff like that,
and I often look at it and it kind of pulls you back to that time.
Peter was thrilled to find what he was looking for
with a company called Border Stoves.
They told him that it would cost £795 for the stove,
which their sister company Border Services
could fit for a further £1,650.
I have to confess, when I got that quote I took a step back
and thought maybe this isn't, you know, a good thing to do
but we'd kind of built up to it
and thought "OK, it's a one off. We'll kind of do it."
So Border Services came to install the stove,
and making, it seemed, the necessary adjustments to the roof,
which involved cutting a hole in it for the flue.
And at first, Peter was delighted with what he'd bought.
The stove's functioned very well.
It's done exactly as supposed to, it looks good, it's very easy to light.
But then, when there was the next heavy rain,
Peter got a rather soggy surprise.
Water was streaming through the ceiling into his house.
The water coming in became a major issue
because the plasterboard on the ceiling got really wet.
It was leaking so far away from the chimney itself,
the fire wasn't drying it out.
Peter immediately got back in touch with the company,
and, after several unreturned calls,
they finally came back to have a look.
As Peter suspected, the problem turned out to be related
to the hole in the roof that they'd made for the flue.
He said he could temporarily sort it out
and hopefully, bring the major leaks to a halt and he started to do that.
After he'd finished the job he then said, "Really, it's temporary."
He informed me that the stuff used should've been on a slate roof
and ours is tiled, so it's really the wrong bit of equipment.
It seems that when Border Services had cut the hole in the roof,
they hadn't sealed it properly leaving big gaps
that were letting in the rain water.
And the repair did indeed prove to be just a temporary fix.
Because the next time it rained, water came through AGAIN.
It rained heavily through the night, and when I got up in the morning
the side of the stove was stained where the water had run down.
There was water on the laminate floor
and it was a right big mop up session first thing in the morning.
Border Services came back again...and then AGAIN...
to try and sort things out.
But each time they came they failed to put the problem right.
So with water STILL pouring through the ceiling,
and no permanent solution from the company responsible,
Peter called in a roofing expert to see what he thought.
He just said...
It's just one of the worst jobs he'd ever seen.
I then got up on the wall to have a look
and he pointed out really why it was leaking.
There was a gap between the tiles that you could fit your hand into.
You can see from Peter's photos just how big that gap was.
And though it has now been rectified,
when we sent local surveyor Steve Vogel to examine Peter's roof,
it was clear that the hole wasn't the only problem.
I can also see what appears to be silicone sealants underneath
the tile, and that has possibly been applied to keep a loose tile
in place and that's just completely inappropriate.
It shouldn't be necessary when the tiles are correctly fitted
and there certainly shouldn't be gaps between the tiles.
When Steve then had a look inside the house there was more bad news.
He noticed that the stove was too close to the skirting board,
which made Peter nervous.
Is that dangerous, then?
Potentially, yes, because these stoves do get very hot
and with it being that close, there is the risk of that
actually burning at some stage.
  Which is why combustible materials all have a minimum
  distance
that they should be kept away from the stove itself.
So it's just getting more expensive all the time, isn't it?
  Unfortunately, yes.
On top of the £2,500 that he's already paid for the stove,
Peter is now looking at having to stump up an additional £600
for repairing the roof and shifting the stove.
So he's written to the company asking them to pay.
But they refused to accept that it could be their fault.
I felt I'd proved it categorically having sent them photographs.
They were self evident, you could see clearly
that there were holes in the roof.
You could see daylight from the whole of the living room as you looked up towards the roof.
Peter says the company even suggested the leak
could have been there already,
and was therefore nothing to do with them.
And when his next letter to them brought no joy,
that's when he wrote to us.
The two companies who sold and installed the stove
are run by the same man.
When we contacted him,
he disputed some of the details that Peter had told us.
He said he hadn't replied to the initial calls
because he was on holiday, and disagrees that he used
the wrong materials, or installed the stove too close to the skirting.
He says poor weather hampered the work he did,
both when the stove was installed,
and on the first occasion that he attempted to put things right.
And he stresses he HAS offered to resolve the situation,
and recommended a firm of builders to do the job.
But Peter has now lost so much confidence in the company
that he'd rather get the job sorted using builders of his own choice.
All he wants from Border Stoves is his money back.
Meanwhile, there's been an awful lot of rain this year,
and an awful lot of it has come through Peter's roof.
So he just wants things sorted.
If Border Stoves came back
and refunded what I'd actually spent on having them install it,
I would then take the view that the matter's closed.
It would be the end of four...
well, nearly five months now of complete aggravation.
Now there's always plenty to worry about if you're buying a new home,
which is why you hope that the survey
will flag up any serious problems before it's too late.
In Scotland, survey information is provided
to ALL prospective buyers from the off.
But unfortunately   that DOESN'T necessarily mean
you're safe from nasty surprises later on,
as this next couple found out.
The Island of Lewis, largest of the Western Isles of Scotland
and home to Norrie and Marina MacDonald,
who last year moved from a small flat to this much bigger house.
It just ticked all the boxes for us.
The location was perfect, the size was perfect,
  and also it was affordable to us which was very important.
  Yeah.
When Norrie and Marina first came to view the property,
like all Scottish homebuyers,
they were given what's called a homebuyer's report,
prepared for them by the seller.
Introduced in 2008, it's a bit like the Home Information Packs
that were briefly available in the rest of the UK.
And one of the key parts of it is a survey of the house's condition,
highlighting repairs that may be required.
The house was empty for over a year.
Now, we came out and we viewed the house with my parents
and my mother, especially my mother.
She noticed...a particularly strong smell of dampness
coming from just the ground floor area of the house.
I thought, "Right, the home report will tell us if there's anything wrong.
"If there's something wrong, we pull out."
What they didn't yet realise
was that the survey in their homebuyer's report
was what's known as a single survey,
which means it isn't a full structural survey
and won't necessarily pick up every problem with the house.
But with no idea of that at the time,
when Norrie and Marina got the report,
everything they read made them feel completely reassured.
The home report stated that everything was a Category One,
which meant that there was no immediate attention required for anything.
We paid particular attention to the dampness section,
which talks about dry rot, wet rot,
and there was nothing other than annual routine maintenance.
As all seemed well,
Norrie and Marina went ahead and bought the house.
But just a few days after moving in,
they realised something wasn't right in a cupboard downstairs.
I walked into the cupboard
and I noticed particularly bad discolouring to plasterboard.
So on walking over to the back wall,
I touched the plasterboard and it kind of felt damp.
I then noticed about a two foot square of dampness
on the chipboard flooring.
As I walked over to the chipboard flooring,
my foot fell straight through the chipboard.
Norrie shouted, "I think you'd better come and see this,
"I've found a problem."
But at that time we didn't think it was anything serious.
But they were wrong.
When the MacDonalds called in a surveyor to take a look,
he found that because the back of the house
is built almost into the hillside,
water was seeping through the earth
and hitting the back wall, making the flooring space completely damp.
And since the house is of timber frame construction,
the wall plate and all the uprights were rotten beyond repair.
When we found out how serious the problem was,
  I think we both absolutely felt gutted...
  Gutted.
  ..Absolutely gutted.
  Yeah.
We didn't know what to do, we just... This was...
We had put all our money into this property.
It was just, it was devastating.
The damp was such a major problem,
the MacDonalds couldn't see how the homebuyer's report
had failed to spot it.
We thought that was something that quite clearly should have been picked up on.
We just relied on that report so much.
We trusted it, we believed in it.
We bought the house on the strength of that home report.
So Norrie and Marina wrote to the surveyors who'd looked at the house.
And while waiting for a response, they called in another company
to work out how much it would cost to put things right.
We had a local surveyor come round to evaluate the cost
and he put the figure at about £20,000.
Now, at first we didn't know... How can we possibly afford this?
  We didn't even believe him...
  No, no.
  We thought this is... No!
Look at how rotten it was there.
But so bad was the water damage, the couple felt they had no choice
but to start the repairs.
They added the £20,000 onto their mortgage,
and got the builders in.
It wasn't an easy job.
The work that went on was fairly, fairly extensive.
Due to the access of the house, there's no access up either side.
So we had to hire in the local crane company
to crane two diggers over the top of the house.
We also had to have all the materials  
all the chip, all the drainage materials  
all craned over the house, which was...
It was just, it was hard work.
In the midst of all that, the original surveyors came back with their response.
They explained they WEREN'T liable for missing the damp,
because when doing this type of survey,
they're not allowed to move things.
When they'd checked the cupboard
where Norrie later fell through the floor,
they'd found a hoover and a box inside.
So, as a result, with these in the way, it wasn't checked.
I think it's just ridiculous
that because there's a box and a hoover,
that a cupboard cannot be checked.
It's just, it's ridiculous.
Especially I'd say, especially a cupboard
  which would show the most vulnerable part of the house...
  Exactly.
..Which is, I would say, three metres under the ground.
But that IS a limitation of this type of survey,
which is why when the couple complained
to the Ombudsman Services for Property  
whose job it is to try to resolve this sort of dispute  
they didn't get the result they wanted to hear.
The ombudsman's report ruled in favour of the surveyor,
basically because they said that they followed the guidelines.
We spoke to the surveyor who'd done the MacDonalds' report...
..And though sympathetic that the family has...
They've reiterated that a single survey report like this
will only include defects which are..
They say their report DID make that clear,
and that the problems later identified were...
We also contacted the Ombudsman Services for Property.
Though sorry the McDonalds had had such a bad experience moving home,
they confirmed that the survey HAD met
the terms of the necessary code of conduct, which...
They say when you're getting a survey, it's important to...
..If the report indicates that access to an area
has not been possible.
If you proceed to buy a house on this basis, you're...
Their advice is to buy a survey type which will provide you with...
..But also ensure that you...
But the MacDonalds are angry that the document they put their faith in
DIDN'T highlight such a major problem.
All we wanted was the house that was reported in the home report.
nothing more, nothing less.
  And we trusted that.
  We trusted it, yeah.
Most companies you tell us about haven't set out to rip you off.
So when you feel that that's what's happened,
it may be that their terms and conditions
just weren't clear enough.
Or when there's been a genuine mistake
that they've been slow to put things right.
Whatever the circumstances, you need to know what to do and where to turn.
So we've put together a free booklet of practical tips and advice.
You can download it from our website...
Or to receive a copy in the post,
send an A5 stamped and self addressed envelope
to the address that we'll give you at the end of the programme.
Still to come...
Massive repair costs, you've no choice about paying.
I'm just flabbergasted,
I wonder what planet people are living on
to think that someone
living somewhere as poor and deprived as this is
would have any kind of money like that.
Now overnight, we turned this empty store
into a free consumer advice clinic.
Our team of experts were on hand to answer your questions
and advise how best to take your complaints further.
So you need to get hold of those credit files
and check that everything on there are agreements that you recognise.
Kerry, good advice, I think,
and the way forward seems to be through the council.
To pay that for a five day trip to Scotland
when frankly, you don't need insurance, is a rip off!
Kelly is hoping that Trading Standards expert Sylvia Rook
can help get her faulty car back on the road.
Six months after having the car, the turbo went.
I contacted the warranty company
who decided that I wasn't covered another warranty,
so I contacted the garage where I got the car from who said it wasn't their problem.
So at the moment, I've had to declare the car off the road.
I'm still paying the finance company monthly for the car.
I can't drive it, it's not roadworthy.
I can't sell the car, I just can't do nothing with it.
Sylvia, is this a common story that we've heard from Kelly,
about the pitfalls of buying a second hand car in this case
and finding that everyone's passing the buck when something goes wrong?
It's always a problem with anything that's second hand,
cos people think that cos it's second hand
you don't have the same rights.
But the Sale of Goods Act applies
no matter whether goods are new or second hand,
and you need to write to the garage saying that the goods
were not of satisfactory quality at the time you bought them from them,
and you copy that letter to the credit company
and say that under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act
they also have liability.
If neither party wants to accept liability,
then you are going to have to go through the courts
and you'll have to sue them to get your money back.
All weekend, the Rip Off Britain team were offering people
some much needed and welcome advice.
I got some brilliant advice and I've now got an avenue to chase up.
I was pleased with the advice I was given
and I'm going to follow what Sylvia's recommended I should do
and watch this space.
Janice and Pat have come to share their gripe
about the legal profession
with solicitor Gary Rycroft.
Where do I start, Angela?
Rock on, honey, you're the solicitor. Come on.
They're convinced they paid well over the odds in solicitors' fees
during their recent divorces.
Was there quite a bit of money at stake with these divorces?
Mine went on for four years.
£61,000 bill.
In terms of solicitors' fees,
the problem with divorces
is that they can go on and on and on.
For lots of legal services you can agree a fixed fee at the outset.
With something like a divorce,
it lasts as long as you two carry on arguing about the assets.
At the outset, you ought to have been told what you were in for,
in terms of the hourly rate that you were going to be paying.
You should also have been told that from time to time
you could ask them what was on the tab,
and you ought to have had interim bills
and an interim statement of what you owed.
Too late to go back and say,
"We are unhappy, is there anything we can do about the bills?"
If you aren't satisfied with the service you've received from your solicitor,
you should always go through the internal complaints procedure first,
but if that doesn't work out you can go to the ombudsman.
Well, we needed you! Where the hell were you?
Thanks for listening to me and better luck next time.
Hey, Gary, they'll be no next time, let me tell you!
Now when a company makes a mistake and lets you down,
I think most of us are prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt
and maybe give them a second chance to sort it all out.
Well, that's what Barbara Watson did.
She spent hundreds of pounds
on something that had a particular significance for her and her family.
But now, more than a year on,
all she's had for her money is nothing but delays and excuses.
Is that Grandad's house?
Yeah, there's one cow.
Barbara and Pete Watson live in Cheshire
with their sons Jamie and Bobby.
Their daughter Danielle sadly died five years ago.
Danielle was due to be 13 years old...
and died the day before her birthday.
I'd gone in the bedroom to wake her up
and found her dead in bed.
Danielle's post mortem showed
that she died from dead in bed syndrome...
with Type 1 diabetes as a contributor.
Danielle was absolutely gorgeous, stunning, lovely heart...
Oh, so tall compared to me.
She was everything, everything to me and my husband.
She's left a big hole.
The family wanted to find a special way to mark Danielle's memory.
Danielle absolutely loved bouncy castles.
Anywhere we went, if there was a castle, she was straight on it.
We decided a bouncy castle would be a brilliant idea
for the children to enjoy themselves, and it would always be there,
it would be in our garden,
it would have Danielle's name across the top.
The other two childrens' names down the columns.
Barbara went online and found a company called
James's Bouncy Castles UK, advertised on eBay.
The website looked good,
the feedback on eBay was brilliant.
They totally understood why I was doing it.
They said that they would make a really good job of the artwork,
considering my circumstances.
The company told her that as it was a bespoke item,
she'd have to buy it direct from them rather than through eBay
and the total cost would be £885 including delivery.
When I actually placed the order with James's Bouncy Castles,
they asked me for at least 50% deposit, if not, full payment.
I decided to give them £500,
so that then I had something else to pay when it was ready.
I pay everybody by bank transfer and so it just seemed easy for me to do.
Barbara was promised the castle would be ready within 12 weeks.
So when that time was up, she emailed to see if it was finished.
They emailed me, saying that it was actually ready
by the end of the week.
If I could transfer the balance
of £385 into their bank account, then it would be on its way.
And that's what I did.
But one month later, the bouncy castle still hadn't turned up.
So Barbara contacted the company again.
Once more, they promised she would receive it that week.
But once more, failed to deliver.
I got an email from James's Bouncy Castles,
telling me that they'd had some problems inside and outside of work
and that was what was causing the delay.
There was no reason for me to not believe what they were telling me.
Again, they told me I would have my castle in about a week's time.
But that didn't happen.
And it was four months
before Barbara was able to chase them up again.
Unfortunately, my dad died,
so I was busy sorting out my dad's funeral and things like that.
I then contacted them again
and this time, I wanted to know the truth.
I wanted to know if the business was suffering financially
and if so, I just wanted them to be honest with me.
The company assured Barbara it would only be another week or so
until she received the castle.
So when that proved to be yet another empty promise,
Barbara gave them a call.
I was actually told that the castle was ready
and that they were arranging to have it sent to me the following week.
Barbara took time off work on the day she was told
the castle would finally be delivered.
It never came and then I received an email later in the day,
telling me that the person that was making the castle
had actually been rushed into hospital.
At that point, I was really beginning to doubt
everything that they told me.
I felt a fool. I didn't think that anyone
could've done this to anybody.
Desperately hoping her suspicions were wrong,
Barbara tried one last tact.
I discussed things with my husband. I said, "If this castle is ready,
"what's to stop us going to pick it up ourselves?" He agreed.
I emailed them again and I said, you know, distance wasn't an object,
I could get a truck and I could come down and pick it up.
And after I informed them that I wanted to pick it up,
I heard nothing more.
Well, it's now over a year since she placed her order.
Yet despite having paid in full and repeatedly being told
that it's about to be delivered,
she still has nothing to show for her money.
So we contacted James's Bouncy Castles UK to find out why.
They told us that the company has had to cease trading
because of financial difficulties.
They claim they were scammed out of money by a customer in Uganda
and they're still struggling with the effects of that.
They insist that there was no intention to rip customers off,
but accept that they should have been more truthful with Barbara,
rather than, as they did, telling her everything was OK.
They apologise for the upset caused, but insist the castle is finished
and have sent this photo to prove it.
But Barbara remains unimpressed.
And putting aside whether the final result
is really worth the £885 she paid,
why did it take so long and why did it take us getting involved
for the company to provide a straight forward answer?
It's the way that she's been treated that frustrates Barbara the most
and now she'd much rather that the company simply donate the money
to a diabetes charity.
The castle was a memorial for my daughter, Danielle.
It was for the children to play on
and remember her and have fun.
I had my heart ripped out when Danielle died...
..and it's so important for me to get to the bottom of all of this.
After everything that Barbara and her family have been through,
I'm sure you'll agree, this was the last thing they needed.
There are of course ways to protect yourself from losing money
when you're making a purchase
and here's some advice on exactly how to do just that.
The best way to pay for anything online or not is by credit card.
If it's more than £100 up to £30,000,
though that won't affect most of us, you are protected
not only by your rights against the retailer,
but if you can't enforce those rights,
then the credit card provider has an equal liability to you.
Even under £100, you get very similar protection
from what is called chargeback.
It's not got the force of law,
but you will normally get your money back even under £100
and that also applies to debit card payments.
So if you want to be protected, pay by plastic.
If you buy something online, or indeed by mail order
or over the telephone, you are protected
by what are called the Distance Selling Regulations.
They say that even after you have made the order
and up to seven days after you have received the goods,
you can just change your mind.
You can send them back and you have to be refunded.
If the goods simply don't arrive within a reasonable period,
then the seller has to refund you.
It's no good them trying to blame the post office
or the delivery company.
It's the seller's responsibility to refund you
the whole cost of those goods.
Now, when you're getting someone to come and do work on your home,
we all know the best advice. It's to get a few quotes
so you can decide which one is the best value for money.
But what if it's someone else, for example the council,
who's decided that the work needs to be done
but it's you who's got to foot the bill?
Will they also have gone for the best value quote?
A home that you own. That was the promise
of the Conservative government back in 1980,
when Margaret Thatcher introduced the Right to Buy scheme.
It is my great pleasure to hand that over to you
as a little token of the occasion.
It meant council tenants who'd always rented
were finally given the chance to own their flat or house.
Since the scheme was introduced,
almost two million homes have been sold.
Karen Greenhalgh's flat in Sheffield is one of them.
She bought it three years ago
and set about making it a home she could be proud of.
It was a dream come true
when I was able to buy my house.
I know it's only a council maisonette,
but for me it was everything.
You know, it's the place I've called home
and tried to make homely.
As is normal in this kind of situation,
although Karen has bought her flat, Sheffield City Council
can still dictate if any work is needed
on the exterior of the building.
And in 2010, plans were approved for the local council to add cladding
to the outside of her block.
Not simply to improve the aesthetics,
but to make it more energy efficient
and extend the sustainability of the buildings for the next 25 years.
I partly understand why the council has done this.
Our people on our estate
do need something that's warmer
and more insulated.
But improvements like that just simply don't come cheap.
And now that she owned her flat, Karen would have to pay her share.
But she was horrified to hear how much that would be.
Because when the council wrote to her after getting a quote,
they said that her portion of the bill would be £10,000.
I had been expecting a bill,
but actually seeing that amount in writing
suddenly made it all seem more real.
I'd been trying to push it to the back of my mind
and I was thinking "Oh no!" You know?
"Surely, this won't be true, surely, it won't be true"
And although Karen's lease does make clear she should pay
a reasonable part of the costs of improvements,
she'd never, ever expected it would be this high.
I'm just flabbergasted.
I wonder what planet people are living on
to think that someone living somewhere
as poor and deprived as this
would have any kind of money like that.
The Council does offer a range of loans to pay for the cladding,
but they all have interest rates of nearly 6% APR.
And one of the things that frustrates Karen
is that however she pays, she's had no choice about what work is done,
when it will happen or even who does it.
It's the way we've been trammelled and told, "You will have it.
"Oh, you've signed a lease. There's nothing you can do."
It's almost standard for homeowners
who've bought under the Right to Buy scheme
to be billed for major works or improvements carried out.
But do councils always get the most cost effective quote for the job?
In this case, there are local firms who claim
they could do the cladding on Karen's block much more cheaply.
But when we spoke to Sheffield Homes, the organisation
that manages council housing on behalf of the council,
they said, "These works, as well as being essential,
"provide value for money."
They recognise that the cost of necessary works can be high,
but say that the bills leaseholders face are low
when compared nationally with other councils conducting similar works.
Sheffield Homes told us the original quote  
the result of a competitive, Europe wide tender  
was a good deal higher than the current estimate,
and the savings from bringing it down have been passed on
to leaseholders, whom they stress have been closely consulted
and involved at every stage of the process.
They point out that where the work has been completed,
residents are already seeing lower fuel and service charges
and are likely to benefit from increased property values.
But they've developed a range of options
for those vulnerable leaseholders who are likely to have difficulty
in paying their share of the costs.
But this is a situation echoed on estates
right across the country, where right to buy leaseholders
faced with big bills for major works want reassurance
the costs are fair and the council has got them the best deal.
It's ruined and spoiled so much.
it's just a financial disaster.
I'm looking at losing my home because I can't afford
a £10,000 bill on top of my mortgage.
I just... I can't.
