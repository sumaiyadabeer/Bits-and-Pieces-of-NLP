it will be Tyrone against Monaghan. Welcome back to BBC World News. A
summary of the main stories: Britain says it wants to pull
troops out of Afghanistan within five years. The Prime Minister
reaffirmed the pledge after holding talks with Barack Obama at the G20
summit in Canada. Voters in Kyrgyzstan looked to have
it overwhelmingly approved a new constitution.
Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes after
floods swept across Romania. Severe flood warnings had been issued. In
some areas it has rained non stop for days.
Plans to build one of Germany's biggest bridges and a motorway have
met stiff opposition. Those are the latest headlines.
All the money news. Welcome to the World Business
Report. These are the headlines: The G20 leaders try hard to find
common ground on growth and slashing at national debts. The IMF
warns they're not trying hard enough. We can co ordinate our
approaches and it continue our relentless focus on economic growth
and broadening prosperity for the world.
A possible landmark trade deal between Taiwan and China. But it is
Asia to the G20. Welcome. Leaders at the G20 try to
find common ground to build a more stable global economy but the
uneven and fragile economy, growing unemployment and debt has meant
there is no easy solution. They failed to agree on a global bank
tax. The IMF is warning without more core unaided action we risk
losing trillions in global output and jobs. They came to Toronto with
two economic problems   an unconvincing recovery and national
debt. David Cameron hopes that dealing with the debt will help
with the recovery. Barack Obama is wary. In the end the communique
acknowledged both concerns and set targets for government debt. Rich
2013. That is in line with plans many of them are already making.
The IMF warns that if the G20 do not co ordinate better, it could
cost millions of jobs and called on them not to delay austerity off is
still    or fiscal co ordination for long. There is no one size 
fits all policy. Most of the G20 countries have to start in 2011 to
begin implementing medium term fiscal consolidation, not to harm
growth in the short term. There was also a setback for the IMF boss.
His proposal for a global lead before banks it was not accepted
but some countries will go it alone. Their art differing opinions among
the country's about how fast they should fix their deficits.
Barack Obama has also said the G20 has agreed on a framework of rules
designed to help banks withstand future will    financial meltdown.
Rules must be clear, oversight must be strong, compressed six   
complex trades must be brought into the light of day. Consumers must be
protected. We must do everything in their power at to avoid the recent
financial crisis. The main concern of Europe is cutting government
debt but in Asia most economies are powering ahead and are worried that
governments cutting back in other areas will hurt their markets.
Disease appease some of the booming Asian economies? I guess to some
extent but really the only indication we have had from what
has been done and said at the G20 is the reaction in the markets
today which have been fairly muted. Most markets in the region rising
marginally, with the exception of the neap tide of Japan. There are
concerns about global growth brought on by the G20. A lot of
people saying that this is an ambitious target   to halve
government debt by 2013. A lot of owners being put on at China and
other Asian countries to start increasing their domestic demand.
They will have to work a lot harder to do that. The Nikkei is still
smarting from its largest weekly loss in one month. He is extending
those losses today. In Japan they are watching economic data which
will determine how the markets go. Many reports out this week.
Crucial talks are taking place to try and strike a landmark free 
trade deal between China and Taiwan. Taiwan's government has been
pushing the deal, fearing the export reliant island could lag
competitors in sharing the spoils of China's vast market. Tens of
thousands of people marched on the weekend to demonstrate against a
historic trade deal. They fear it could make the island too dependent
on China and politically vulnerable. China's stills    China's still
considers Taiwan of one of its provinces. The deal allows these
products to come in to China tariff free. Critics say it will
cost thousands of jobs and this is just the beginning. The Government
has tried to make the agreement palatable or Taiwanese people. It
has excluded the honourable products. The deal opens the
floodgates to more Chinese products and the investments. For this man
it could force him to shut down his factory. In the past
we had more than 1,600 porcelain factories. Now there are a less
than one dissent    10% less. Chinese factories are cheaper. Once
the agreement is signed, I think the impact will be greater.
Factories he will not be able to survive. The Government says that
the agreement will boost trade and jobs. It is crucial for the
survival of the island according to President Ma Ying Jeou. Without the
agreement Taiwan will lose access to Chinese markets. Taiwan depends
heavily on trade. That is why we want to participate in regional
economic integration. We want to start with China, our largest
trading partner. If we can do that we may be in a better position to
make a similar deal with other major trading partners. This is an
important step for Taiwan. Despite the protests, big businesses are
hoping that trade he will bring much needed investment to Taiwan.
They also hope it will give them greater access to Chinese markets.
Taiwan may be taking a gamble by signing the agreement but many
people here believe the heat has no choice, but that its economy will
suffer if an agreement is not reach. In other news now: The union at the
centre of the long running row with British Airways has offered to
postpone its strike ballot of cabin crew so they can consider its
latest revised offer. The Unite union was due to begin balloting on
Tuesday unless there was a breakthrough in the dispute.
The latest oil company to stop selling petrol to Iran.
A brief look at the markets. The Nikkei slightly down. The European
markets waiting to see what goes on at the G20 summit. That is the
business use for the moment.    business use.    news.
More news around the UK. The British Medical Association claims
the health service is facing arbitrary and indiscriminate cuts
because of the financial crisis. The chairman has warned it that
some of the changes already made will have a lasting impact on the
quality of care that patients receive.
This is not a comfortable time to working in the health service.
Although the Government has promised to protect health funding,
the price of healthcare is rising fast because we're all getting
older and dreaming is costing more. Recruitment freezes, including in
frontline medical posts and evidence of GT's    GPs having to
refuse medical treatment to patients. I think it is rash,
unplanned and unfocused. Nobody rejects the idea that we have to be
more careful with the limited money we have and now we have to make
difficult decisions but the only way you are going to get the right
decisions is if you go about it in a logical, not haphazard way.
Government says that saving should be found without affecting
frontline services and money saved should go back into patient care.
The issue is that doctors faces    face a serious ones. They know they
face cutbacks but the issue is how large those cutbacks will be and
how they will be able to protect patient care.
Breakfast coming up and the latest World Cup news including a
postmortem examination on where England went wrong. Germany sent
them home, causing misery for English fans all over the world.
Many fans are now heading home. You are watching BBC World News.
Our main stories: Britain has reaffirmed it was to pull troops
that Afghanistan within five years. The Prime Minister made his pledge
after talks at the G20 summit in Canada.
Kyrgyzstan seems to have voted for a new constitution weeks after the
violence. Russia warns that political violence could lie ahead.
This is a resounding Yes vote for the referendum. Very much what
interim authorities wanted. Now they can press on with those
democratic reforms they had promised. They have a lot more
legitimacy than they had. This is a government that has never been
elected because it came to power after that coup in April. It is a
hurdle art of the way and they can press on with reforms.
UN did the people have been evacuated from their homes in
Romania after severe flooding    hundreds of people.
Campaigners in Germany are complaining    trying to get the
Government to scrap plans for a bridge and a motorway.
In a few minutes we will be looking at the newspapers today. Stay with
us for that. Many members of minorities are Pakistan are uneasy
about the future. Their concerns have been exacerbated by the
storming of a mosque in Lahore. This community in Europe was under
threat in Pakistan but to have dozens of its men and boys gunned
down as they prayed was far beyond the worst fears of most here. This
woman lost to a 17 year old son. She lived through his ordeal with
him over the phone. He called us from the mosque. He told
us about the gunmen. When he called again he said the attackers were
coming to where he was hiding and then the line went dead.
Two mosques of a minority sect were stormed by militants. Children were
among those who were shot dead at close range. This is the entrance
to an area of a    where the vast majority of people up are of a
minority sect. Far from up receiving sympathy they would
expect after a horrific attack on the community, they have received
more death threats. There have been statements from clerics declaring
them not Muslims and many Pakistanis agreed. This man escaped
the attack but saw many died right here. He is afraid to reveal he   
here identity. Not even our neighbours came to pay their
condolences, he says. They're not the only minority that has been
attacked in the past year. More than 40 Shia Muslims were killed in
an explosion during a religious procession. Eight members of the
same Christian family were born to    burned to death by a Muslim mob.
Human rights groups think that religious law should be scrapped.
The Government thinks that would not be right. People would be
uncomfortable and when people are uncomfortable they take the law
into their own hands. The idea that religious laws stop attacks on mine
   minorities is something you're not convince these people off.
They're living in fear of the next Let's look at the newspapers. The
G 20 talks in Canada dominate many papers were the biggest economies
have committed to halving government borrowing in the next
three years. This paper highlights America's concern that cutting
spending immediately could put the global recovery at risk. The Moscow
Times reports on the referendum which asks voters to vote in favour
of shifting of presidential power to the Prime Minister. The unite
trade union has exposed the latest ballot of cabin crew. Strikes for
August have been delayed and industrial action is not likely to
also a tender. There will be strike action in Spain. Madrid's Metro
passengers may experience a 24 hour work slowdown. The union argues
that the private sector and police should not be subjected to a public
sector pay cut. And we tried hard but it wouldn't be a papery blue
without mentioning football. The Independent shows a gloomy picture
of Wayne Rooney after Germany and blew away their arch rivals, 4 1.
Other papers look at all games, some of which were marked by
referee blunders. We are joined by their chairman of industry. Let's
start with a story in the International Heron    Herald
Tribune about the G20 summit. There are some divisions there, they
tried not to show them but there is an issue over how to take the world
forward. Yes, at the centre of it is the world's wealthiest economies
and fastest growing countries. Willerby domestic growth that
provides the solution or exports? Many want China to release its
currency value, if that increases, it makes good in China cheaper and
it stimulates the economy. In the past, Russia since have been driven
by the US consumer. You can see where Obama is pushing for that.
They are worried about the European export markets, slower    slowing
down too quickly. He is announcing a slowdown but... Cameron got a lot
of kudos by its    for his Budget. Will it get the economy fired up or
will it create another recession? The agreement to cut the deficit is
what most people were already deciding to do. They have agreed to
follow their own paths. This was exemplified in banking nth   
banking reform. Canada, today is greater in terms of banking than an
Britain. But they are opposed to that, as is Australia. If in four
years for now, the British economy is pulling out, it will be a good
time for an election. Let's look at British Airways. The final offer
seems to be on the table. How hopeful are due of a settlement?
This dispute has gone on for 18 months. The next strike is
threatened for August. Not a great time, the holiday season. At the
core is British Airways's accruing cheaper staff. They're on a cheaper
base rate. British Airways cabin crew action is to try and freeze
anything that will take away some of their benefits. They're doing
the right thing by casting a ballot but the unions are not supporting
this. The Guardian newspaper quotes a British Airways manager who
claims that the dispute is driven by desire to break the trade union
and the climate of fear that pervades the airline. It shows that
even the managers are not quite sure the policy being pursued by
the airline. Everybody is waiting for up what the cabin crew decide.
It is a hard one to say. If they will get further public support,
and nobody knows. At some point, the law of attrition sets in.
management at British Airways have been playing hardball and are much
more tough then you would normally expect in an industrial dispute.
They want to humble them. Clearly, given where we have got austerity
measures and fiscal restraint coming in in the public sector, you
can only go so far to get support from people as a union member.
France and Spain as well. Correct yes. Don't all these strikes tell
us that people are reluctant to cut their standard of living despite
what they are hearing from the government? That may be true but
the... you cannot afford to keep the same boring growth if you want
to keep your place in and competitive economy. Let's end with
this story. Not happy if you are in England but happy if you are in
Germany. England is out because of this goal which was disallowed and
it is one of the reasons England failed against Germany. The referee
was not looking. You can see it crossing the line. They had it with
Argentina and Mexico, a controversial referee. This tells
me Fifa needs to grow up and embraced the Rules of technology.
You cannot have us at this time not having instant replay or a goal
line technology. Every other major sport in the world uses it
especially with so much money at stake. A good point to end on.
That's it from the two of us, It was a hot day for many of us
yesterday, temperatures reached 31 degrees. We will not be too far
from that today, either. A very hot and sticky one in central London,
not much better outside either. A few showers around today,
particularly further north and west. We have one or two of those working
their way across Scotland but they will ease away elsewhere. It looks
as though it will be a humid start to our Monday morning, temperatures
greeting us at dawn sitting between 11 16 degrees. Plenty of clear
skies and sunshine and plenty of warmth. What is in store from
under? Not a bad start from any of us but you can see some cloud
Northern Ireland, western Scotland and into north west England and
Wales. There will be some showery outbreaks of rain here as well.
Plymouth and 23 in Cardiff. We will see a few showers across the west
of Wales. Welcome showers for the gardens but not great news if you
are out there are enjoying a holiday. For Northern Ireland, an
overcast afternoon. Showers will move towards Glasgow. To the
extreme north of Scotland, we keep the dry sunny spells. There are
likely showers into the lake districts but to the east of the
Pennines and through Lincolnshire and East Midlands and the south 
east corner that is where we keep the heat and humidity. Temperatures
up to 29 degrees. Great news for Wimbledon, so far, not a drop of
rain. It's likely to stay dry but we cannot rule out a light shower
extensive overnight Monday and into Tuesday. The fund will pretty much
die off but on Tuesday there will be more cloud around, a few showers
across northern England but still warm and sunny with some late
