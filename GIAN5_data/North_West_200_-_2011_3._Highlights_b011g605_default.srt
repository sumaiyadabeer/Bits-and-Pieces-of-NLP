The stunning north Antrim coast line is backed Dr Northern Ireland,
biggest fastest and most exciting sporting event. Welcome to the
Relentless International North West The start of the Superbike race
The top teams and some of the world's best riders are here to
race on the closed public roads between the towns of Portrush,
Portstewart and Coleraine. Speeds of over 200 miles an hour. Steve
Parrish takes us on a lap of this My passion in life has always been
looking at the course in one of We're over the start and finish
line. From a standing start, of course, it is exhilarating straight
towards Millbank Avenue. Over the top of Primrose Hill. This is that
front Whelan's, it is hard on the brakes for this, the very sharp
left hander at York corner. A very tight corner. Right into first gear
for that corner. Up the words the roundabout. He    up the war as the
roundabout. There is where you have to take a deep breath. On the
Superbike, if your tyres are warned, you could do it absolutely flat out.
It is probably the most dairy the corner on the circuit. We're now on
The college the straight, but it is not really. The fastest I have ever
the first year, the sharp left  hander at University Corner, very
important to get the break. If you getting too early, somebody will
should, it does not matter in a helicopter. The opposite way round
of the roundabout can be tricky and the slippery. Remember cars and
lorries to go round it. Sharp left banking in the helicopter and then
Then it is,, a lot of riders might From then on him, it is heading
Metropole. Here it is, we're going to bank hard left into the
Metropole. The sea is in front of us but the riders will not see that
because they are going fast and the left hander. Underneath the railway
line, that has all been resurfaced. It is much me there now.    it is
much smoother now. We end up there was Juniper Hill. That is your last
chance, realistically, if you're going to pass anybody, Juniper Hill
is your only real chance. Then it is the climb back up the hell, to
Quarry Hill corner was Steve Plater unfortunately had his accident here
last year. If you're incredibly careful, you can pass someone into
that last corner. It has been done before but that is not too often.
That is it. It is nine miles, but that think we did that in about 4.5
minutes. You'll not see a more spectacular circuit.
The first races for the Supersport Race machines and in poll position
is local rider Alexander seely    Alastair Seeley. He won last year
it and he is back as a big favourite. He gave me an insight
into his preparations. No pain no gain! People think sitting on a bet
is like an armchair. Especially for my size and framed, it is
definitely hard work. At the end of the last lap, the person that has
put the a burden in the winter it pays off in the last lap. It is
nice to have that extra push to take you to the line. There is no
better feeling than getting to that chequered flag. We have pumped up
to six laps per race and I'm going to do all five races. Come that
last race, the big Superbike race, hopefully I can repeat that
Alastair Seeley has been say    shipping up in the ring with the
Commonwealth Games silver medallist. It is hard to believe the need that
much fitness for the racing. I know that I'll get in the ring and get
punches thrown at me. It sitting on the bike is a lot of work. They do
need a lot of fitness. It is good for somebody that has trained so
hard. I have done some circuits with him here. He is like a machine.
It is nice to throw a few shots at them and say that I had the
Commonwealth Boxing Day. He got me with a good shot in the ribs and
did they want out of my sails!    took the wind out of my sails!.
an Irish man has to win the north  west. He is doing his homework. He
is quizzing me to find out what to do. If you going to go for that
record, you have to get the first race of the day. I think he is
ready mentally and physically. My heart will be in my mouth for the
Also hoping to deliver a knockout blow at this year's North West 200
is Australian, Cameron Donald. A rider that's as happy on the water
as on the track. Over the last few years I've done some silly things
at the North West 200 all in the name of entertainment. Wallace and
Gromit with Guy Martin, tractor racing with Michael Dunlop, but
I thought I would take Cameron Donald out of his comfort zone by
taking him kayaking in the beautiful Portrush. Little did I
know! I've done some crazy tough at the
TT, I won a not of North Wests, but I have never been so frightened in
my life! After a bit of tuition, Cameron was
Then my turn. A few wobbles.
Mind you, I did think I was going to be high sided a few times.
Great fun. I was starting to think he might
have done that before. I was really starting to enjoy
Cameron and the guys went out to to sea in the rough stuff, but to be
honest that was way out of my league.
I'm quite happy to have a go at anything on dry land, but the wet
stuff, that's a different story. If it goes as well this weekend as
he does in the kayaking, he will definitely be up there.
A few years ago, I helped introduce you to the North West 200. You have
given me a totally new experience in life today. It has been a role
reversal. I remember you taking me around the north west course and
showing me the ropes. You didn't tell me that you were
that experienced before we started? I live on the river outside of
Melbourne and I try to get out in the boat a couple of times a week,
but that's white water kayaking. This is a different experience.
I believe you are living in Portstewart now, you are even
considering moving here full time? I don't know about full time yet,
but I enjoy the summer. If I'm going to be based in the UK, I may
as well be based here, near the ocean and go for a jog along the
beach and a paddle. You're all fired up at the moment.
You have had second places, third places and is this your year for
the win? I ended up on the podium, but not on that top step. A lot of
other riders have the same idea, so it is going to be tough.
Well the weather on the north coast left the racing circuit very wet
for this opening race. It is time this around and start the day with
Johnson came off the the third role. Cameron Donald, number eight
critics went backwards. This brave stuff as well! Gary Johnson, that
Number Number 77 is on the inside and gets in there nicely.
He just tickled it through. We are back with Cameron Donald. He
has got the strange tyre choice that guy Martin.
He went for the more road thread pattern. Farquhar had the
intermediate on. He has the drive out of that
roundabout. That could pay off for him later in
the race depending on how the tyres wear. Look at the pass out of the
slipstream. He through it past him and shut the door on him.
Four abreast. How much do you like this? Who is the bravest into the
chicane here at Mather's Cross. Ryan Farquhar is being chased by
another local man, Alistair Seeley. These high speed trains are just
like that. Just when you think you have it done and dusted everyone
else comes up alongside you. They go over the chicane and we are
back at the front, Seeley, Farquhar and Gary Johnson and they go side
by side. Farquhar is trying to outbrake Seeley. Seeley has it done
and dusted, hadn't he? This exact machine is the machine he rides in
the British Supersport series. He knows all about it. We are back on
board with William Dunlop heading down towards the the Metropole.
He was top of the time sheets on Tuesday night. Bruce Anstey...
is going to be tricky. Johnson gets in there first. It is extraordinary
stuff. They seem to have huge amounts of gross. The number 86 bus
comes around here in the mornings. We are almost a lap down. We have
got a classic. Bruce had a good look there. Underneath the railway
lines. Charging through here. On board board again still with
Cameron Donald who is really making up a lot of time. Johnson gets a
bit of a lead. This is Dunlop again. We tip it in
as the Coast Road train gets up into another gear. It is Alistair
Seeley. Yes, and that's Bruce Anstey on the
white line there. Look at this, again three abreast as they come to
the braking zone at the Juniper Hill chicane.
Michael Dunlop is making up time, isn't he? Gary Johnson dare not
look over his shoulder! Cameron Donald made a lot of ground
up. He is going to try and catch up. We are on board with William Dunlop
again. We will be over the line to finish the first lap.
Johnson, with Seeley behind him. This is Seeley's chicane. Is he
going to do it? Yes, he is, Alistair Seeley. We saw him doing
his move last year, but that was in dry conditions. Trickier here today.
Did you see that, Farquhar, spun up on that height line, but kept it.
They are going towards Primrose Hill. This is some of the best
racing. They keep swapping places. It is
Bruce from Gary Johnson, from Alistair Seeley and Ryan Farquhar
and behind behind. I was about to say it is a five man
race, Cameron Donald has come through to join the party! He is
behind Ryan Farquhar. Here he goes, look at this!
Relentless riders, relentless riders did lead this race. Cameron
Donald got past Ryan Farquhar. Another one coming through. All
trying to prove a point and definitely finish ahead of Alistair
Seeley and win it if they can. What about Bruce Anstey? The most laid
back man you have ever seen. He is He is there in front. The track is
getting dry. You would think that would play into the hands of Ryan
Farquhar. How can a man dressed in a quilt
race like this? I don't know. He has kept himself warm. William
Dunlop, on board, look at the suspension movement there.
Look at Ryan Farquhar. He was so close.
Right out to that white line. Started spinning. Kept it pinned.
Cameron Donald, who is he chasing now? He is in the thick of it.
Cameron Donald had an awful start. He was dead last as they left the
line and now he is up there contesting this battle. Ryan
Farquhar dropping off a bit. He lost a lot of ground along that
far strait there. Seeley, number 34. A lot of people said Cameron Donald
only went past in practise, but he is proving he is as fast as anyone
in these conditions. Alistair Seeley looks very much, he
is so neaty and tidy, isn't he? Seeley, he just looks as if he and
the machine are one. Through the magic Roundabout, up over the hill
towards Mather's Cross. Look at the bike at the back of these four,
that's Cameron Donald on the Honda and the power and slipstream. We
are on board with Cameron Donald. There is the Honda. Let's see who
is the latest on the brakes here. It all changes in the length of a
strait, you go from first to fourth. Gary Johnson, up the slip road. He
is back in front. But he lost momentum.
He will lose a place here for sure, would he not, Steve? I would have
thought so. There it is. He loses that second place. Gary Johnson
loses his second place. Cameron Donald. How close is that!
Not a lot of room. That was a little bit rude, "I'm coming
through.". Gary Johnson thinks he will have another stab at that as
they go through the final chicane. The track is drying. The wets will
be up to temperature. That track is drying out now. The heat from the
tyres and the bikes going past it. They will be thinking, "Maybe a few
showers would help these rear tyres." I would have thought that
Ryan Farquhar's rear tyre would be getting good.
I don't know happened to Guy Martin. Room for two!
Not quite. That was Gary Johnson trying to make that move back into
second place. It is about the boys that qualified first and second and
it was Cameron Donald who was quickest from Seeley, but at the
moment it is the opposite way around. Under the railway bridge.
Up towards Black Hill. This is resurfaced. It is smoother than
last year. It is proper short circuit stuff. It is a lovely
swooping bit of racecourse. Expect Seeley to excel here. Cameron
Donald looks all around him. Seeley rides that bike all the time and he
owns the final chicane at this racetrack at the moment.
It does seem so, lovely to see Cameron Donald back on form. That
nasty accident he had a cup of    couple of years ago. Gary Johnson,
all but out on the white line. Donald on form again. With William
Dunlop through the chicane through untouchable here. Using all the
body movement there, look at the concentration that these guys have
to shift their weight around I huge amount. And Cameron Donald leads
Alastair Seeley. Alastair Seeley is the king of the late breakers, the
all. They all but touched. Alastair Scilly was doing everything he
could but he nearly ran into the back of Cameron Donald. Nothing to
be gained or lost here. You have to come out if you well. Although
every the ideas, using up all the wrote, they will be up to 50 year
and still accelerating.    50 year. If anybody can do this it would be
Alastair silly. It is dry, you can see what or taking up.    water.
There are still that of spray on this part of the circuit. We talk
about the straight, but there are lots of drinks.    Kinks. Alastair
series generally fast in these parts. it is trying out. There is a
fairly stiff breeze. The weather conditions are improving. What that
the gap their! We have this roundabout coming up here. Alastair
Seeley closes him down, being very careful. On the link road here with
William Dunlop. Got to be patient there. Too much too soon and it
could all end nastily. One of the opera thing is because of their
track trying, you cannot let the tyres get too hot. Rear wheel up in
the air there from Cameron Donald. He wants to stay in the slipstream,
he needs to be half a dozen by clients at most behind Cameron
Donald. He wants to stay with them up until the chicane. Lockett are
whetted is there. That is a vast difference to earlier. Alastair
Seeley leads this race. He already has four wins, he is going to make
it five. Here comes Cameron Donald will, straight back on it all my
goodness me, he was on the back of the bike. How close delight that?
That was all for one another. Alastair Seeley has been living
with this kind of behaviour week in and week out in British Superbike.
Cameron Donald looks as though he has the measure of them, but you
never know with Alastair Seeley. Gary Johnson went through this be
trapped the fastest. That was impressive at nearly 170 miles an
hour and a wet on a Super Sport bike. This has got so intense that
they had pulled clear of everybody else. Here is everybody else. That
was nearly is to have the seat, Lee Johnston. These two are still
battling it out. The machine sounds good, handling well. Huge amounts
of performance and the grip. You can hear the traction controls
working there. It is cutting in and out, just helping him. Helps save
the tiger, not only helps the rider. Through the chicane over the line,
this is a two man race now. Cameron Donald using his body weight.
is the shot from the helicopter. They are very close as they head to
York Corner. The helicopter cannot keep up with these machines the
high speed they are running at. Look at Cameron Donald, almost out
of the seed. He works the big through the chicane and did so grit
over, wet roads, I know they have the tyres, but that his confidence.
   that his confidence. That is Ryan Farquhar in orange. He has a
slightly different rear tower    higher. He might be struggling in
the damp patches. In theory, at endurance Wise, that should be
better. Ryan Farquhar has dropped red backed from the battle at the
front. Michael Dunlop there with Gary Johnson. We're back at the
front. They get so close. You have to do that. There is not a lot in
it. I think that Honda has a bit more power. The Alastair Seeley at,
three laps, two to goal. All their races that the shortage from six to
five laps because of the weather. We forget the speed, the wet tyres
will not last at this distance. Even in wet conditions, the tyres
get hot. The tyres looked in good shape at the moment. This looks
like a fairly distant    decent gap. Gary Johnson looks a lot closer.
The it is always easier to close the gap on breaks. You get a better
indication of what the other guy is doing. But this what happens as
they come up to the chicane. Cameron Donald picking up. Alastair
Seeley has just ridden past him for. Absolutely annihilated him there.
That is about being at match fit.     that is about being a race fit.
All racers want to be leading all races all the time, no matter what
lap it is. If you get the opportunity, that is the way to go.
You can see the track is trying there. This is the dryer part of
the course. Still a few spots on the camera, it is that    not
completely stopped raining. This is this would bring in racing part of
their circuit. We were with the William Dunlop there. They are at
it again. Absolutely nothing in it. Cameron but will    Cameron Donald
has a lovely style. He can hear that traction control to his biting
little but as it starts spinning. It has a system that monitors front
to rear wheel speed. Through the chicane to start the next lap.
Cameron Donald behind Alastair Seeley. You can see their the
different style. Alastair Scilly is all PUP up and Cameron Donald is
jumping all over the place. There he goes again. That could be the
fact that his traction controls working that little bit better.
Here he comes again. You can see the bikes moving around a little
bit. The wet tyres move around. They have enormous amount of clap  
  grip. They have less ADL on their track because of all the cuts. If
the track it tries too much, they want to be careful not to overheat
these tyres. Alastair Seeley is a long signed Alastair Donald as they
come into the trees.    Cameron Donald. He should have the speed
now. The nearly touch there. Now he is on the brakes and the House the
inside line and he should be through. Alastair Seeley, late on
the brakes. He has all the confidence. Cameron Donald from
Melbourne Australia has never won here. He has added to podiums. Will
he get his first win here, in 2011? It is a long, long straight, a mile
to the next chicane. Cameron Donald is tucking in. Here is Michael
Dunlop. He is on his own now. can see the fox is going on. In wet
conditions, you have to be so smooth. You have to keep yourself a
nice and tidy. It is Cameron Donald's turn. He it looks as if
the Honda has that little bit more. We had seen Alastair Seeley get
alongside, but very rarely get through. Cameron Donald using the
defensive line, but no chance. the worrying thing from Cameron
Donald is that whatever happens is that... The whoever does that
engine does a very good job. This is the last lap. Cameron Donald is
doing everything we can to get to the outside. This is the race to
the line, there is ennui to perhaps one more opportunity. This is the
crucial point now. On this two mile stretch, this is Alastair Seeley's
bit of a racetrack. Cameron Donald has his work cut out. The best
chance he has now is it tiring it out here. Sealey is hugging that
outside line. It looks as if Alastair Seeley has it, it looks
like Alastair Seeley's first    that one. Cameron Donald made a
mistake and has lost some ground. That has given us Stassoulli summer
breathing space. Alastair Seeley all over the hill. Banking it left
there. There is another chicane to man from Carrickfergus. Five wins
at the north west. Seeley had to do that or he would have lost it. Here
comes Bruce Anstey over the line to take his third place and get on the
podium. He will be delighted about that. The kiwi had another good
rise. This goes Michael Dunlop, Gary Johnson in fifth.
Dunlop missing out on the podium here at the opening race of the
2007 North West 200. Alistair Seeley wins his first race of the
day by less than a second from day by less than a second from
Cameron Donald. Alistair, that is quite a start to
the day? Yes, it is what we hoped for and now we have got it, but it
for and now we have got it, but it was a tough race.
Cameron was with me the whole way. All of a sudden he shot by me down
in the Primrose. I heard his traction control working. In these
conditions traction is a help. We dug in and got the slipstream and
the last two laps we were trying to figure each other out.
What was your strategy? I was planning on following Cameron. I
came early and had to change to Plan B and we got him. He tried to
go by me in the Coast Road. I saw his front wheel and moved over.
There was no elbow bashing or anything. A good race. A big thank
you to the team and a great win. I felt calm under the helmet
considering I blew the start. We had a problem getting off the line.
From dead last to come through. I felt calm and comfortable on the
bike and I thought I had Alistair's measure in a couple of spots. He
saved that little bit of push to the last. We took it to the wire.
To run with the likes of someone like that, I'm happy.
Bruce, third place for you. You saw the last few laps out there on your
own? I saw the rest got in with a battle. We held the rest up for a
bit. I don't know when I broke him. It was a lonely race in third, but
The most famous name in Irish motorcycle road racing is Dunlop.
The rivalry started between Joey and Robert Dunlop. The new
generation is Michael and William Is there a lot of rivalry at the
household? Who is the one? Is it a fight for the cornflakes?
It is not so bad. It is not too bad? It is not as bad
as as people think. Do you swap information about the
bike? Michael would be secretive anyway so would I as well. But we
are on different makes of machines. They are different. It is quite, it
is sneaky that way! It is just like anyone else. I'm riding for my team
and I want to win and William is riding for his team and he wants to
win. There is a lot of rivalry. It is the same for me. Once I put my
helmet on, everybody is a rival. The worst person to beat you, would
be your brother, isn't it? At the end of the day he is one of the
main boys. How much pressure is there on you
you being a Dunlop and representing that name? Being a Dunlop you've
got to win. Obviously the name, winners is what we are. A lot of
sponsor pressure can come into it, but lucky enough I have no sponsors
that are worried. It is my own self inflicted pressure. They know they
don't need to put pressure on me because I put it on myself to win.
How does your mother feel? It seems she enjoys those side of things.
She She seems to like it, but at the same time I'm sure she does get
nervous when we are out and about with her being through it all, she
knows what it is all about and what it takes to win and stuff.
If you can win that blue ribbon race as a Dunlop in particular at
the north west it would really roll back the years? It would be nice.
My sponsors have put a lot of money into getting me a good bike.
Hopefully if I can win a race it would be the icing on the cake.
What about your bike? It is really good. The Honda has got such a good
chassis. I really enjoy riding it. How proud are you to be
representing the Dunlop name and following in the food steps of her
father and your uncle, Joey? Everybody wants to be a Dunlop. Any
racer, they were the kings, you know. For me to win, that's crucial,
you know. So it is not much pressure. If I win, I win. If I
don't, ah, well, another day we'll have another go at it.
I think these guys are after us, speed up a little bit.
You two can sort it out on the track on Saturday. Let's sort your
brother out here! These two can sort it out on the
track on Saturday. As for today, my One man who enjoys racing in the
rain is Dungannon's Ryan Farquhar. He is hoping to add to his three
North West 200 wins in a year when Hi Ryan.
How are you, Phil? This is the empire, where all the magic happens.
I heard about the new workshop, you have built. I have now seen it, it
is a superb bit of kit. Will you give me a tour around the place?
Not a problem. Come on ahead. Have a look in here.
This is a bit of a mess at the moment.
It is a tidy mess to me. Sometimes you can be working on a
bike late at night and there is some wee thing that you need turned
or mild or weldedment you can't go there and then. You just have to
have everything on site. Take us around the rest of your
work workshop now. No problem!
You saw my workshop, Philip and my machine shop. Here is a few of my
trophies that I've gathered up over the years. No workshop is complete
without a trophy collection. This is a superb collection. They
are from everywhere. It is like, what's your most prized tro trophy
here? The first time I stood on the podium with Joey Dunlop was the
1997 Ulster Grand Preand it is pretty special to me. Joey was a
hero of mine and to stand beside him, you know, on the podium on an
international race was something pretty special.
Zbluf had a good year this year, you have had six wins at the
Scarborough road races and five wins at the Cookstown road races.
Let's talk about you. Are you going to stop racing? I don't know. I
don't know. There is is times, that you know, I I think that I
condition get away from    can't get away from it and other times I
would like to get a rest from racing. It is hard to say. I want
to see how this year goes. I want to get to the North West and see
how we get on and what we learn from that and take it from there
really. I think you have all the makings to
run a good team, Ryan? Maybe. You never know. Your five North Wests
in one day could go. As long as an Irishman gets it, I
will be happy. There is a lot of people eyeing up that position. I
think with your set up this year and your bikes, you know, it might
happen sooner than you think. I'll give it a go.
Good luck at the North West 200. Cheers.
Ryan Farquhar starts on the fourth row of the grid for the Superbike
race. He is one of only three riders who have actually won a
North West 200 race including Michael Rutter, a 12 time winner at
the north west. How are you feeling about the conditions and the race
ahead? I can't wait until the end of the day to be honest.
I don't like these conditions. It is great when I am at home and you
know what is around the next corner. It is not so bad at the moment
because it is constant wet and when it starts drying up and gets heavy
or whatever, so. We'll dot best we can.
You have had success in the rain before? I have had good rides and
that, but it is not my favourite. Well, with detier rating   
deteriorating conditions, Rutter decided not to run on the decatties.
I said I would share my brolly if I could share your quilt. What do you
make of the worsening conditions make of the worsening conditions
now? I prefer one or the other. Totally wet or totally dry. Once it
starts drying and it is in between, it is hard to choose the tyre. Wet
tyres or dry tyres. If it is cold, how much does that
If it is cold, how much does that affect you and the machinery?
I have only got one set of leathers. That doesn't help either. You try
and keep as warm as possible and see how we go.
So confirmation of that controversial decision then by
Michael Rutter and and Martin Jessopp not to take place.
Jessopp not to take place. It is fairly horrendous conditions.
There is the grid. Michael Rutter will not be there nor Martin
Jessopp. Alistair Seeley who had a poor
qualifying. Bruce Anstey, William Dunlop.
It is a busy field. There is lots of talent there. The rain could
change the game. What do we think now as this depleted front row gets
ready to go? Trying to get the power down, we are talking 200
horsepower. Bruce Anstey gets a good start. There was Alistair
Seeley, but it is Michael Dunlop, followed by the number 12 machine
there... That's Gary Johnson. That's on board with Bruce now.
that Ryan Farquhar going around the outside of everybody? It is. He is
on a super stock machine. Lots of spray already. Look at this.
Michael Dunlop from Ryan Farquhar. That's the view from Michael
Dunlop's rear wheel. Yes, and that's number 77. Ryan
Farquhar, but we are climbing the hill and the water getting moved.
Look at the the spray off the back of those big wets. Michael Dunlop
tips in into the little, slow roundabout.
It was an all action there. Now we start getting up high speed. We are
still on board with Bruce Anstey. They head off towards Station
Corner. This is where you have to be brave. Michael Dunlop leads this
field. Bruce Anstey in third and Gary Johnson, over the top and
there you can see number 34 there, he is still going good and that's
Alistair Seeley. Alistair Seeley and Cameron Donald
on his tail. Watch the slipstream coming into play as they reach
180mph. You could see number 77 Ryan Farquhar is gaining and
closing. He is in the slipstream. That shows because in the
slipstream if he had been on a full Superbike he would have been
through to the front. He is just eating the spray off the
back end of that that bike. Seeley, has he made up a place or two?
think he has. There is no chance of the tyres overheating. Bruce Anstey
in third place. Looking forward. Over the Link Road it is.
Dunlop, from Ryan Farquhar, right behind him. There is Bruce Anstey.
I think that's Alistair Seeley. It is Alistair Seeley on the move.
Yeah, look at the focus and concentration. It looked like Ryan
Farquhar's advisor was starting to    vicer was starting to fog up
there. If Ryan Farquhar is going to do anything, it will have to be on
the brakes. He doesn't have to have the outright speed. We are on the
inside here with wrust Bruce. Are we going to get a pass? Yes, we
are! Alistair Seeley. Where did he come
from, says Bruce! He is good on the brakes. We have seen that in the
previous race. There he is in third place. Number 34 goes up there.
Here comes Ryan. Alongside and past. That was
tremendous stuff. Michael Dunlop is back at him and
Alistair Seeley coming up towards the chicane. How late on the brakes
is he going to be? The water is everywhere, but Seeley used the
pour we are. Down    power. There he is leading the race again. He
just won one race and now back at the front. Again starting seventh
on the grid. Seeley is something else here today. There is number 86,
Cameron Donald. He was hot in the 600 race earlier.
Salster Seeley is    Alistair Seeley is the man that we look back.
Alistair Seeley is the one who could take away the record this
weekend and win every race on the card. It looks like it from here,
doesn't he? Look at the angle from Ryan Farquhar. We have got good wet
tyres on, but incredible, the conditions getting the bikes really
cranked over. Through they go, through Church Corner on board with
Bruce Anstey. Heading up the hill. The smoke,... That must be Ryan
Farquhar. That was a big moment for Bruce Anstey.
Look at the smoke trailing behind. Ryan Farquhar has a problem. He is
dropping oil. There must be oil pouring out of that.
There is oil on the track. This is horrendous in wet conditions having
oil on the track. Alistair Seeley won't know anything about it. Ryan
Farquhar doesn't know. Look at bike snaking into the corner. That is
horrendous. Oil in these conditions will be over the track. On board
with Michael Dunlop. They were in front and won't know anything about
. They are away into lap lap two. Alistair Seeley in the seat and
well in charge. Surely they are going to have to
stop this race. And they are still going for it.
Over the line, so leading at the end of the first lap is Alistair
Seeley. Everybody says Seeley will win five.
Nobody has told Michael Dunlop. The hole in the screen, a stone has
gone through it. We have a red flag. There must be
oil on the circuit. This was the moment, want it?
the helicopter, they are starting to see smoke coming out of number
66 of Ryan Farquhar    77 of Ryan Farquhar. Oh my goodness that was
side ways at 100 mph. He might have thought he was on
standing water. On board with Michael Dunlop m here
we are. We will see if we can see that big moment. There it goes
again. That was a massive slide. Ryan Farquhar looking for,
consolation, inspiration, I don't know what, it is all over him for.
Ryan Farquhar, his lift to the pad OK arrived,    paddock arrived.
Everyone is doing all they can. Guy Martin is pointing out where the
sight and and let's hope they can do something about it.
It is all very well pointing out where it is, oil oil spreads on
water, I think this is a big ask to get it cleaned off.
We could see how far the oil went because we could see the smoke.
Ryan Farquhar didn't know. He thought he had hit standing water.
A brave decision? Sadly that's the end of the racing today.
A disastrous day for the North West A disastrous day for the North West
200. Weather conditions, you can do nothing about. An oil spill, we
have we have worked and and worked at it. We have spent two hours
trying to get it cleanment it is a massive area. It is difficult when
they are out there racing on it where it can be so, so slippy.
A disappointing end to the North West 200. Is it fair to say the
organisers did everything they could to get as much racing as
possible? The organiser did do do everything. They worked their butts
off, even Mervyn Whyte was out with the brurks. The brushes. They have
had a real unfortunate, sad day. What's the key to to keeping the
motivation to make sure we come back next year with a bigger and
better North West? The support from the riders, the support from the
press and the support from the fans and Mervin will be back, bigger,
