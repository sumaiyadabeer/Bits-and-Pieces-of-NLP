Millvina Dean was the youngest survivor of the Titanic.
Amazingly, 96 years later she was the oldest.
Millvina escaped the sinking ship at just ten weeks old,
but her father never made it.
After being rescued from the Atlantic, the Titanic Relief Fund
offered three shillings and sixpence a week to support Millvina.
It sounds like a pittance, but it paid for her schooling.
The letter sustained her later in life too.
She auctioned it off to help pay for her nursing home.
She had this celebrity star status about her.
To be honest, I was a wee bit in awe of her.
The money from the Titanic Relief Fund
was certainly a leg up
so that Millvina could prosper in life.
