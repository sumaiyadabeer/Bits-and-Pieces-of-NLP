decision of its social services department to remove three children
from their foster parents because the couple were members of UKIP. We
will be talking to a former Children's Minister in our top
story. This week marks the 70th
anniversary of the Beveridge Report, which gave us the welfare state.
But is it now time to build a new welfare state? Liam Byrne, Labour's
Work and Pensions spokesman, joins us for the Sunday Interview.
burning question the Prime Minister will have to answer this week, when
Leveson reports on Thursday. The two sides go head to head.
And on Sunday Politics Scotland... Could you afford to pay for your
defence if you are charged with a crime? Holyrood wants to cut the
Legal Aid budget. So who picks up What ever plan is sketched out, it
10 us never forget, you cannot really talk about a free press and
the situation. I a lot of this was to do with the behaviour of the
newspaper group with which you were involved. There are plenty of laws
already in place. Except the press still behaves disgracefully the way,
for instance, it has treated the McCann family. Why does it deserve
another chance in the last chance saloon, when you have been drinking
in there for 60 years and nothing has changed? Their recent cases,
but not instantly recent. The newspaper industry is not going to
miscreants and cases of bad conduct. There could be a system of press
That they said, we are going to behave ourselves, everyone would
say that is OK. But the lesson is that that that does not get a deer
to. When it comes to the lock, you can only make use of the lot if you
are incredibly rich. But what about people who are attacked to do not
have any money. That has to be stopped. They will lose conditional
fee arrangements, which was the only way that people who had no
money could get redress. The E East have access, the swift response and
guaranteed action by the newspapers are to act upon what they were told,
in you lot would not force the police to do anything we did not do
in the past. To suggest that the rules put forward will work is just
nonsense. It is just a contract between the press which the press
will not enforce. The is no barrier to entry at all. He is there is.
Every newspaper war have an ombudsman. There will be forced to
act swiftly. But they will be hired by the press. The law. Is it will
not be. The proposals which have been put forward to say that. If
you have not seen them, I will give you a copy of them. The full thing
is actually quite a long report. Thank you for that. It is all there.
But this is the Mafia getting together. It is not the Mafia.
when we talk about the disgraceful treatment of the McCann family by
some British tabloids, will that not happen again. Mr X will always
be made.    mistakes will always be made. But there will never be a
case like that of the McCann family ever again. Their report is
Good morning and welcome to Sunday Politics Scotland. Coming up on the
programme... If you ended up in a criminal court,
could you afford a lawyer? Changes set to come in will mean fewer
people will qualify for legal aid. The Justice Secretary says the
small not undermine access to justice. And I will be finding out
how a skills shortage in the renewables sector threatens
Scotland's energy targets. And will Spain and Catalonia live
happily ever after? We will be live in Barcelona, the day they go to
the polls. Could you afford to pay for your
defence if you are charged with a crime? The government wants to make
more people stump up, but critics say they are targeting those who
can least afford it. So is this a simple tweak in the Legal Aid Bill
or a dangerous challenge to access to justice? Hayley Jarvis is at
Glasgow Sheriff Court. If you end up in here, will you be
able to afford to pay for a lawyer? The criminal legal aid bill last
year was �98 million. The Scottish government says this has to change
and more people will have to come up with the cash.
Under their plans people who, at the moment, would get their defence
costs paid will face bills of hundreds of pounds. And if you have
a disposable income of more than �68 a week, you are in the frame
here. Lawyers are threatening to strike
over the plans, but those who support the bill say the Justice
Secretary has to balance the books somehow. He has made the policy
choice that he wants to provide civic legal aid. I personally think
it is the decent thing to do. We are any recession.
So who will have to pay? Not those on benefits would fall below the
threshold and not middle income families, who would not qualify for
criminal legal aid anyway. Critics of the plans say it is
those who can least afford it   people who are working, but do not
make much money. Now is is about access to justice. It is about the
21 year old on the minimum wage who would be represented in court, but
who might not be. It is not a contribution, it is the removal of
legal aid. The government wants to save �3.9
million on the criminal legal aid budget, saying the system must
become more efficient. They insist the changes will widen access to
justice. But their critics say they will have the opposite effect. They
are predicting chaos in the courts with more people defending
themselves and innocent people pleading guilty because they cannot
afford a defence. Very often, people do not have sympathy for a
solicitor's. But there is the case that a fair trial could be
interfered with and this is a test of the Scottish legal system.
Everyone in Scotland has a legal right to a fair trial. For a
government hoping to save money, the cost of denying people an
adequate defence could prove extremely expensive in the appeal
courts. Just before we came on air, I spoke to Justice Secretary Kenny
MacAskill, who was in our Edinburgh studio, and suggested to him there
was an obvious danger that access to justice would be compromised.
do not believe so. What we have got to remember is that the legal aid
budget was the second highest on record. Two thirds of that was
spent on criminal legal aid. We have been faced with massive cuts
from London and we have to look at the role of every organisation. We
need to preserve the integrity of the legal system   not go down the
road of south of the border where you cannot get legal aid for a
whole range of things   and that is why we support the principle of
contributions to the victims of domestic violence, there should be
contributions from the alleged perpetrators. These contributions
would be the same. There is obviously a legal obligation on you
to run a system which guarantees a fair trial. If we look at the
potential consequences of what you are proposing, if people plead
guilty because they feel they cannot afford legal aid, that is
one issue. Another one is that if people defend themselves and come
up against a professional prosecutor and a thrill weight of
the government prosecuting machine, you are saying you have no concerns
about this would breaching fair trial considerations? Nor, I do not.
I do not want to be where we are, but we have the huge legal aid
budget and we are facing huge cuts. We need to have a shared burden. 82
% of people who apply for work legal aid do not have to make a
contribution. After that, the contributions would be fairly minor.
This has been made clear by Parliament, why should the victim
of domestic violence have to pay for getting a protection order when
the alleged perpetrator does not have to pay? That has been a
manifest injustice in Scottish legal aid. We are going to change
that. We want to create a level playing field. As I said, the vast
majority will not have the contribution to pay and others will,
but it will be assessed on their ability to pay and, in most cases,
the contributions will be modest. That way, we protect the integrity
of the system and there is no evidence that similar systems which
operate elsewhere that justice is interfere with. It is the 20 % that
you are talking about who will be called on to contribute. It could
be argued that people who are regularly in court to not have jobs
and a guaranteed to fall below this threshold. It is low income
families who will be most affected by this. For example, someone with
an income of �160 a week will pay �473 as the contribution to the a
legal aid. That is just a few pounds short of the entire fixed
fee. That is not a contribution figure which is known to me. Back
interior of someone who earns more than �200 who will have nothing to
pay. The figures you for what are not recognisable to me. It does
seem to me that there has to be some parity. At the moment, we're
getting children who have to be taken into care should have to pay
a contribution. Victims of domestic violence should not have to pay
when the alleged perpetrator does not. They should have to pay. It is
wrong that they should not be in the victim should have to. What
about the expenses park? We are never had that system in Scotland.
He faced the sanction that the court pits upon you. It is not a
question of expenses. For instance, someone who is privately paying
would not get any costs back. someone defends himself in court
and Barnes really expensive court time and if it turns out you have
to then go to the Appeal Court, this amount in savings will be a
drop in the ocean? That is right. If the scenario panned out that way,
but the evidence from elsewhere is that there are not many more people
appealing. There are always some people who choose to appear
unrepresented in Scotland. But evidence from elsewhere suggests
that people do not become more unrepresented. Are you reviewing
the threshold? He yes, they are. This threshold is the same
threshold for a similar legal aid. I have made it clear I would like
to see an increase in the threshold. It would be manifestly unfair if
the victim of domestic violence should have to pay a higher
contribution than the alleged perpetrator. I am prepared to
increase that threshold. We will have discussions with the loss
society on that. But we have no more money for that, so it will
have to come out of the legal aid budget. Her which she described
you're relationship with Scotland's solicitors, who are threatening to
go on strike again. I do not like to see us and the situation. But we
are having to cope with cuts from Westminster. I do not like to see
injustice anywhere. But we have to come to terms with the consequences
of cuts from Westminster and we have to look at that budget. The
budget from my office says that legal aid will have to be cut by
seven % in its budget. But that compares with a cut of 17 % south
of the border. The but it will mean that we retain all the situations
where back people will still be able to get legal redress. He know
that in civil actions you can get expenses and you can get damages
from that. Do you accept that you where it defence solicitor that you
will be astonishing them with this proposal? You can have your
children taken from year by the powers that are available and the
consequences that up apply to civil matters. I have never
underestimated the amount of trauma in relation to the likes of
domestic violence. There is a manifest injustice there. A work
legal aid budget is the highest ever. 14 legal firms received over
�1 million from legal aid. But it is their own fixed fees and this
idea that they are all making money hand over fist is not right. If
they are learning that, they are doing it the requisite number of
cases. I have not seen the are a earning money hand over fist.
suggesting we are in difficult times and the need to take a share
of that band that burden. We will protect those who need to be
protected. That goes for the victims as well as the perpetrators.
Thing to very much.    thank you very much.
A leading engineering company has called on the Scottish government
for help to bridge a skills gap in the renewables sector. This comes
as a report from Holyrood's energy committee says that gap and other
key areas are hurdles to ambitious green energy targets. It is hoped
the equivalent of 100% of Scotland's electricity needs will
be generated from renewable sources by 2020. There are some flashing
images at the beginning of this report. Degree is a bright future
in a growing industry for these apprentices. But training from this
college courses not enough to get people up to scratch. We would like
them to be here for the remainder of the week that there is no
funding mechanism for that to happen. We need to do more tough
bridge that gap. It is agreed that the skills gap could hurt the
industry. Some environmental groups say that the targets are to
bureaucrat of too bureaucratic and counter productive. We want to be
good places for communities and to his arm. There is adequate space
for us to be developing an infrastructure. That was not a few
shared by everybody. The committee took the view that the independence
debate was not having a negative The Scottish government see the
report as a vindication of their green policy. It is about
generating income for communities, jobs for many people in the nation.
Not 18,000 as the First Minister stated, then corrected this week.
Of those jobs will be subsidised by households across the UK.
Westminster makes clear how much that bill will be in the future.
are investing into cream    green energy. At the moment it is 2% of
people's bills by 2020 it will be 7%. Infighting has made the
decision about setting green targets has been delayed until
after the next election. Ed Davey has been diminished and his
defensive about this delay. Opposition parties have been angry
that targets have not been made. Crucial hurdles need to be met
before they can be achieved. Joining me from our Dundee studio
is Mike Weir and the MSP Tavish Scott. Mike, if we look at the
subsidy structure, how much is a problem is to secured long term
investment if there is not a certainty about the subsidy
structure coming out of Westminster. Investors want to know the long 
term structure because these investments are for the long term.
The energy bill has put forward a new structure, we have yet to see
the detail. There are already worries about how which will work
and whether the price for Nuclear will be higher than for offshore
wind. We need to detail this to see how we go forward. We need    we
are keen to build up renewable energy. But we need to have the
structure correct. Tavish Scott, access to the grade is being called
for, but it looks as if the islanders will not get reduced
costs at this stage? Yes, that issue needs to be resolved. But
Shetland has agreed to set up a working group to tackle the
island's issues. The two governments should work together on
this vitally important thing, that renewables coming into Scotland can
feed into the grid. The regulator is right to roll up    to insist
that happens at a cost which does not put this projects in jeopardy.
De you feel that the independence to pay    debate is itself creating
controversy and putting off investors? That is the view of
Scottish and Southern Electricity, one of the biggest players in the
industry. Their views, the industry views, are more cautious than the
political ones. It means that there is uncertain future simply because
why could England rely on this, they could purchaser from anywhere.
Is there evidence that the debate in itself, or where energy would be
bought from in the future, would be a problem? No, there is none. If
you look at a Viva, who invested in Scotland to build wind turbines.
England will still need energy. Maybe    Tavish Scott Scott says
maybe they won't buy it from Scotland, who knows. But Scotland
has a huge black    potential for renewable energy. The capability
gap between what is produced and what is needed within Great Britain
is producing. But Scotland can continue to sell energy to the rest
of the UK. It is not unusual to sell energy across Borders. Tavish
Scott, let me ask you about the other potential hurdles, is the
planning or training? The crucial issue is training. We have had a
discussion over college funding in recent weeks. Your report
illustrated the need for funding of colleges. It has been cut in
government    in Scotland by the Scottish government. I want the
government to get their ducks in a row. I think it is right to have
these desirable long term targets but they also have the    have to
have the other building blocks in place, the skills. The college
sector is under pressure from the government and they need to be
given the flexibility to get on. Mike comedy next accept that there
is a problem with training at this point?    Mike, do you accept.
should look at what the oil and gas industry are doing. They have their
own training bodies. People in my constituency are getting
apprentices. It is a competitive industry and there are crossovers
between it the renewable industry and oil and gas. It is not only the
government, the industry itself also should look at how it trains
up the skills that it needs. What about construction and generation,
what you think the picture is at the moment at the moment? In
different parts of Scotland, is there enough of a spread? Projects
are delivered by individual companies making assessments of the
best capabilities. In other words, where it is best to put wave and
tidal energy. The West Coast and the Northern Isles of Scotland are
important in terms of the ways and tides. In terms of the construction
contracts, would that have to be a these localised places, or could
there be a better spread? I don't think it is for the government to
start laying down will wear Industry decides where it wants to
build wind turbines Towers or other infrastructure that they need for
these projects. We didn't tell Aberdeen to become the offshore
centre of Europe. The industry did that. That's the way it should be.
Mike, we are out of time but do you think you'll meet your electricity
target by 2020. We will, in a way we have already exceeded our
interim target and there is a bright future for renewal energy in
Scotland. Coming up after the news, we visit
the Spanish region of Catalonia as voters go to the polls as the
governing party seek a mandate to hold their own referendum. Let's
cross now for the news with Maxine Good afternoon. One woman has died
and hundreds have been driven from their homes in storms. Scotland has
form    has borne the brunt of the weather.    the South West.
The rain has stopped but the market town of Malmesbury is under three
feet of water. People had to be rescued from the worst floods in
decades. We had around eight or nine inches on Wednesday night.
Everybody has said they had never seen anything like this before.
Dozens of businesses have been    homes have been left under water.
All we could do was mark the position of the flood water. At the
height of the storm, high winds brought down the streets in Exeter.
A woman had been camped in the tent underneath. Two men were also
injured. It was the south west which bore the west of the
overnight rain. At one point there were four severe flood warnings in
this county. There are still more than 200 alerts in place. In Devon,
hundreds of homes were deluged by the floodwaters, with the residents
using any means to keep the flood waters down. It is coming in all
the rooms. The flood waters may have begun to recede for now, but
there is more to come. Another band of heavy rain is expected.
Our correspondent is in Cornwall where the river burst its bank   
its banks. More bad weather on the way?
Yes, and things were pretty bad last night in the whole of Cornwall.
Overnight, the river levels here rose dramatically, resulting in a
severe flood warning, the most severe that the Environment Agency
give. That has been downgraded in the last hour. The skies are still
looking pretty leaden. The rain it may have stopped but we know that
more bad weather is on the way. A fresh weather system is due to come
through bringing more rain to the south west and heavy and persistent
rain to the north west of England and the north of Wales this
afternoon. A new law criminalising stalking
has come into effect in England and Wales today. Those convicted will
face up to six months in jail. The change followed a parliamentary
inquiry which showed that 120,000 people, mostly women, are stalked
every year. People have died in a clothing
factory fire in Bangladesh. People jump from windows to escape the
blaze. It was in the capital. Good afternoon. BAE Systems could
decide to close one of their major shipyards next month. The future of
Govan, Scotstoun and Portsmouth are in doubt after the completion of
two new aircraft carriers. The chief executive has warned
manufacturing may stop at one of the sites. BAE are in discussions
with ministers about the future   union leaders say they're
apprehensive. We have had talks with the company and that has been
the suggestion. In reality, the sooner the decision is made, the
better. It is just fuelling speculation.
Scottish Women's Aid is launching a campaign to highlight why women do
not leave violent homes when they're being abused. It's called
Together We Can Stop It and looks at ways the public can stop abuse.
Victims' real stories have been recorded and released on the
charity's website. Rugby   and Andy Robinson has
stepped down as Scotland coach. The Scottish Rugby Union made the
announcement in the last hour. Yesterday's defeat to Tonga was the
19th in Robinson's 35 matches in charge and comes at the end of a
calendar year which began with the RBS Six Nations wooden spoon.
After all the fine weather yesterday, a rather dull affair. A
lot of rain around central Scotland and eastern Scotland. That will go
into the North Sea. It would turn to snow near Aberdeen. A trying
picture from the West. It will fill rather cold today under all that
cloud temperatures will go to about six Celsius. We are picking up a
fresh northerly wind across the Now it is that time of the day
where we take a look back at the highlights of the Week in 60
Seconds. It was a wet start to the week for
many people across Scotland, with flooding causing major disruption
to roads and towns. The further education saga
continued, when Education Secretary Mike Russell apologised to MSPs for
giving wrong information on college budgets.
MSPs from Scotland's three largest opposition parties launched their A
New Union plan, to find agreement on further powers for Holyrood if
Scots vote no to independence. Labour's Michael McMahon was banned
from the chamber for a day after heckling the Speaker, Tricia
Marwick. Mr McMahon said he felt the punishment did not fit the
crime. Order! Order! I would ask you to withdraw it that remark.
And no agreement on the European Union's budget. Prime Minister
David Cameron insisted the deal on offer "was not good enough".
The people of Catalonia vote today after a bitter and hard fought
campaign dominated by the issue of independence from Spain. The
elections were called by Catalan president Artur Mas, in a bid to
get a mandate for a referendum, something the government in Madrid
has ruled out. But there has been a furious response, with one Spanish
newspaper accusing Mr Mas of corruption just a week before the
poll. Our political correspondent is in Barcelona. Sealed with a kiss.
A happy couple celebrate their wedding day. Modern Spain was
united. Their political successors have fallen out. President Artur
Mas called for a referendum to get the mandate on independence. It was
demanding a new place within the country. Even if he does get
support at the ballot box, it does not mean it is going to happen. The
Spanish constitution blocks the road to independence. Independence
campaigners say they need to have their say. We need to
be given the chance. Things got rather messy after a leading
newspaper accused Artur Mas of corruption. Companies are come here
because what it is like and have people find that the government is
putting up walls around the region, it would be catastrophic. Those in
favour of independence hope that the vote goes their way and the
force Spain to give them a fort on independence few. What kind of
result is expected? What are the early indications? It is clear
enough that there will be a majority in favour of independence.
The real question is whether Artur Mas gets the out right majority he
needs. He is having to deal with these corruption allegations. He is
accusing the Spanish President of been behind these allegations. But
of course, there are also having to deal with their share of the
mentioned in this? Yeah, it is very interesting. Artur Mas has called
for an Alex Salmond style push for independence. Now, at regarding the
NATO situation, they have become very clear on this, as opposed to
Scotland, when Alex Salmond became very defensive when asked on the
issue. Thank you for that. Sorry that we were slightly off sink on
that report. We will have to leave it there. We will get early polling
and L indications of their results later this evening.
