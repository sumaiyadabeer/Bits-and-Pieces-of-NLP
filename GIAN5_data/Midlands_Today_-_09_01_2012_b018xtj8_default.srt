Good evening, welcome to Monday's Midlands Today from the BBC.
Tonight: the missing hours in the hunt for the killer of a retired
schoolteacher. I am determined to identify the person responsible for
this. We know when we had floods and when we've had roadworks that
people go and shop somewhere else. There are other small towns not
very far away. They don't come back. As we are told to have two alcohol 
free days a week, how easy is it to go on the wagon?
And another page in the story of a village library, shut because of
cuts. It has reopened because of Good evening and welcome to the
programme. Tonight, they're missing hours in
the hunt for a killer of a missing school teacher.
There are at least 12 hours that can't be accounted for from when
77 year old Betty Yates was last known to be alive until when her
body was found. She was killed in her cottage close to the River
Severn at Bewdley in Worcestershire possibly after disturbing a burglar.
It's been confirmed she was killed with a knife.
More tributes have been paid today to Mrs Yates after candlelit vigils
were held at the weekend. Forensics officers again at work at
Betty Yates's riverside home. She was stabbed to death but police now
say she had other injuries besides, though they wont specify what.
had suffered an horrendous attack. The officer leading the inquiry
says she was last seen a week ago today but there are missing hours
yet to be accounted for and he's appealed for more help from the
public. I am keen to appeal to anybody that has information or saw
anything suspicious that evening, the evening of Monday 2nd January
until Tuesday 3rd January. I would say that we've had an excellent
response so far from the public, which is not surprising because of
former pupils who held a vigil last night near the driveway leading to
her secluded home. She taught for many years at what used to be St
John's middle school in Kidderminster. She was a fantastic
teacher, absolutely superb. I am ready saddened by this, I cannot
believe somebody would do that to somebody like Betty. Police have
traced a woman who posted a message on Facebook implying this was a
burglary that went wrong. They say it's just one in a number of
theories. But another former colleague is in no doubt how Mrs
Yates would have reacted when confronted by an intruder. If this
is true, I think she would have tried to reason with them first of
all and I am not sure after that. But I should not imagine she has
changed much over the intervening years. Yes, I think she would have
a go. As the floral tributes mount, the police are continuing to search
the woodland attached to Betty Yates's cottage. That surge will
take some time to complete.    search. Police took 80 phone calls
over the weekend but a breakthrough remains elusive.
And police want anyone with information that could help in
their search for the killer of Betty Yates to call them.
Coming up later: a former soldier's mission to conquer Everest to raise
money for fellow wounded ex  Tributes have been paid to a 13 
year old boy from Staffordshire who died while playing in a junior
league football match. Liam Wood had just scored a goal for his team
AFC Saints when he collapsed yesterday.
Flowers have been laid on the pitch at Knutton, near Newcastle under 
Lyme. Hundreds of tributes have also been left on social networking
sites. The phones have not stopped. The e mails are coming through. The
team members are on show strong network sites doing different thing.
   social networking sides. There were dozens and dozens of kids
buying flowers this morning. Traders in a Worcestershire town
fear their businesses will be hit hard by the closure of a major
bridge. It comes at a time when some shops still haven't recovered
from the effects of the worst floods in living memory.
The Teme bridge at Tenbury, which is a designated historic monument,
will be shut for ten weeks for major repair work. Drivers could
face diversions of up to six miles. More on how the town plans to cope
This bridge was first built in 1390. It has been going for quite a long
time Munton is in need of serious refurbishment.
For traders, the repair work could damage them. A lot of that traders
are apprehensive and concerned because that is the main route into
our one st town. Essential works are being done. It is worrying
because when we've had floods or roadworks, people go and shop
somewhere else. There are other small towns not very far away. They
don't come back. The bridge is open to pedestrians and cyclists with a
temporary car park. But by 9 o'clock this morning it was already
full. Now I have to take a six mile trip to get into the town.
Tenbury's been forced to try and keep its head above water before.
The devastating flood of 2007 saw some businesses sink but then as
now, the town is still most definitely open to shoppers. There
are incentives in place to try to persuade people to shop in Tenbury
including this shuttle bus service. It stops at the end of the bridge
and goes into town every 15 minutes and there's a loyalty scheme for
shoppers with a thousand pound prize every month. Will it stop you
coming into the town? I cannot walk very far, this is about as far as I
can get. I hardly use my car. is any consolation, the repair work,
once it is done, should last for It's expected the government will
give the official go ahead tomorrow to the controversial High Speed
rail link that will shorten journey times significantly between London
and Birmingham. Ultimately the scheme's to be extended further
north at a total cost of ï¿½32 billion. The scheme's aroused
strong opposition because of the damage to homes, businesses and the
environment. Our Transport Correspondent is in Curzon Street
in Birmingham now where HS2, as it's known, will arrive in the city.
Are we pretty sure the decision will be tomorrow?
There is little doubt we will see an announcement tomorrow. The
Transport Secretary is expected to that    issue a written statement
tomorrow morning and that will then face MPs in the Commons has around
3:30pm. They have been delays to this announcement. It was due to be
made before Christmas. It seems unlikely we will see further delays.
And is it just about certain that the Government will be supporting
HS2? Again, there is little doubt the
scheme will get the green light. When they delayed before Christmas,
they said they needed to do more work. It seems unlikely that they
will now scrap the scheme. I gather there is already talk of a
legal challenge from protesters. It is a controversial scheme. It's
not surprising that we will see legal action. Cast your mind back
to when the M six toll was given the go ahead by the government six
years ago.    M6. We may see a judicial review which may delay the
scheme. It depends on what sort of review was launched. The government,
I guess, will be ready for that. A charity has stepped in to help
people get rid of unwanted cardboard after a local authority
stopped door to door collections. Shropshire Council says it can no
longer collect cardboard as it can't be recycled as green waste
and composted. Several other local authorities are considering similar
action. As many as 90 cars per hour turned up at this cardboard
collection point at the Red Barn Pub in Shrewsbury. It's one of
three set up by a charity who want to ensure cardboard is recycled
properly, any money raised goes to local charities. It is needed. Look
at the people here. Until recently, in Shropshire people have been able
to put their cardboard in their green recycling bin. But now it's
been discovered that the inks and the coatings on the cardboard can
have a detrimental affect. Ink and other contaminants are class stars
potentially toxic. If you put plants in there, it could kill off
plants. So the council is asking residents to take cardboard to the
main recycling centre in Shrewsbury and numerous other collection
points. But the charity behind the temporary collections says it's not
enough. If you do not have a car, you cannot recycle cardboard at the
moment in Shrewsbury. This is giving people an option in the
short term. They can do something about it. Go over to the
battlefield recycling centre. There is    There are long queues. This
is a perfect opportunity. It's a good idea. It's a community event
but not something I could commit to every weekend. First should be
reinstated. Shropshire Council say they're exploring other ways to
make cardboard collections. In the meantime it seems the people of
Shrewsbury at least are keen to keep green.
New advice suggests we should all have a couple of alcohol free days
every week for the sake of our health. But if you're thinking of
cutting back on alcohol, how difficult would it be to give up
for a whole month? Our sister programme Inside Out set
that challenge in December. The brave volunteer who gave up
drinking for the month was BBC Shropshire's Adam Green.
During the day Adam Green is a presenter at BBC Radio Shopshire.
In the evening the chances are you'll find him down his local pub.
By Adam's own admission he likes a drink, so the challenge of giving
up alcohol for the whole of December won't be easy. I'm not a
heavy drinker but I am someone who will not turn down the offer of
having a pride, if there is one going. The majority of people, when
I've told them what I'm doing, have all said that is ridiculous! On the
first day, to find out how his drinking rates, Adam travelled to
West Bromwich to meet Dr Martyn Hull, a GP who's an expert in
substance misuse. 16 could sue him to a harm for all higher risk
category of drinking. Having come in here, thinking my drinking was
sociable, every now and again, and to be told that it is potentially
harmful is a real eye opener. It's quite shocking. Throughout December
Adam kept a video diary, which showed the highs and lows of his
teetotal challenge. I could really do with the drink drive now    a
drink right now. This is the past it's been.    hardest it's been.
Here in the West Midlands, over the last ten years, hospital related
alcohol admissions have nearly trebled. So after 29 days without a
drink, Adam returned to West Bromwich to see if his health had
improved. Over all, it's been a hugely positive experience. It's
made me have a rethink on drinking. Adam says he'll still go to the pub,
but the alcohol free challenge will make him think about just how much
he now has to drink. Well, let's go live now to Adam,
who's currently in the middle of his radio show but we can speak to
him now. Adam, what was it like giving up over Christmas a time
when most people are partying and usually drink a bit more? Yeah, it
was tough. It is also the month of my birthday so it made it doubly
difficult. Office parties, social gatherings, things like that that
testy when you're offered that first drink. That was almost the
hardest moment of any night out. it got easier at the time when Tom,
did it? It's definitely got easier as he got on. By Christmas Day, and
almost forgotten that this was something I was undertaking. It had
become the norm. It wasn't that I was not drinking, it had become
easy and it was not something I was struggling with by that stage.
everybody wants to know is did you achieve the target? Did you have a
whole month without alcohol? suppose you'll have to watch the
programme to watch    to find out! Did you? It was what some people
describe as a glorious failure or, close enough!
Thank you for taking part in our experiment. And you can see more
about Adam's challenge and beating the booze on Inside Out here on
BBC1 at 7.30pm tonight. Still ahead tonight: a big rugby
upset, as Worcester turn the tables on near neighbours Gloucester.
And a new week but are we going to see a repeat of the same old stormy
weather? Catch up with all the The first public library run by
volunteers opened in Warwickshire today to replace one being shut
because of cuts. It was in February last year that Warwickshire County
Council said it had to save around ï¿½33 million. Among the savings,
reducing the number of libraries from 34 to just 18. But thanks to
unpaid volunteers, the 16 libraries that were to shut will now stay
open. The first of those new community
libraries began operating today and our reporter has been to see how it
will all work in practice. Villagers in Kineton were on a
crash course this morning, learning to scan and stamp books. Without
volunteers, there'd be no library, and no collection of childrens'
books for these eager readers. is good for the village and local
people. It makes local people feel more involved in the community
which can only be a good thing. But it nearly didn't happen.
Warwickshire County Council withdrew funding, and the library
moved from this feature property to a small room in the village hall.
This village has had a library since 1877. This is one of around
16 in the counter that will be staffed by volunteers. There will
help to save the county council around ï¿½2 million. There might be
some people who will say you are not bothered about a library
service for this county if you're washing your hands of it. That
actually isn't true. We are keeping our major libraries are open. There
are 18 for libraries across Warwickshire that we are keeping
going. They account for over 90 % of the original for four.
County Council will continue to stock the libraries but it's also
pushing the concept of downloading books from home. Volunteers say
they'll strive to keep this building going. This is a nice
village and we have lost the police and fire stations. Those other
things we cannot replace as ordinary citizens. Of course,
something like a library we can. We can make our contribution on that
and try to keep it going. Kineton library's open for just two days a
week, for a few hours thanks to volunteers. Meanwhile, many of the
larger libraries with paid council staff are seeing their hours
reduced under their budget cuts. We'll have a round up of the FA Cup
action in a moment but first an excellent win for Worcester in the
big rugby derby at the weekend Dan. A season defining moment, wasn't
it? Worcester Rugby Club say they can now target a place in the top
six of the Premiership after beating rivals Gloucester.
Worcester came from behind to beat Gloucester 21 15 at Sixways on
Saturday. And they hope a high league finish will convince some of
their star players to sign new contracts at the club.
Don't think the hard work has suddenly stopped. Worcester might
have secured a memorable derby over victory over Gloucester on Saturday
but Monday morning means a weights session for some. For Andy Goode a
stroll on the Sixways pitch was a chance to relive his match turning
moment. A penalty right on half  time. He is straight through!
Goode's try put Worcester in front and there they stayed. He hopes
they can now forget about relegation from the Premiership and
target a top half finish. Everyone outside of Worcester has said all
year that it would be Newcastle to go down. Everyone in Worcester has
bigger plans. Things are moving nicely and and the mice    right
direction. We need to continue to build on the last few weeks. Back 
to back wins means that lunch at Sixways will be a relaxed affair
this week. But although the fear of relegation is receding, head coach
Richard Hill's next worry is contracts. Winger Marcel Garvey,
who scored a sensational try in Saturday's win, is among several
high profile players who've yet to commit to Worcester for next season.
Ind off form at those two wingers are in, we would love to keep them
but when they are playing like that and Marcella scoring tries like he
did against Gloucester, they are going to be a target for Keane's
further up the league.    Marcel. But many more days like Saturday
and Worcester's prize assets might find leaving Sixways becomes harder
and harder. Robbie Keane went training for the
first time with Aston Villa this morning. The Republic of Ireland
striker is hoping to make his debut at home to Everton on Saturday.
Keane, who's 31, scored against Villa for West Ham back in April.
He's the tenth highest goalscorer in Premier league history. And his
loan move from the LA Galaxy should be completed in the next couple of
days. In the FA Cup, Wolves and
Birmingham will replay at Molineux a week tomorrow, after their no 
score bore at St Andrews. Tamworth and Cheltenham couldn't topple a
Premier league giant. But there was a hat trick hero at the Hawthorns.
And a noisy demonstration at the Ricoh Arena. It's exactly 25 years
since Coventry won the FA Cup. How times change. On Saturday, the fans
brought a coffin to highlight the dramatic decline of a club that's
now facing relegation from the championship. And hundreds voiced
their anger against the owners, SISU. Sell up, get out, and let us
get all the supporting our club. the moment there is only one day,
down. I've got family who I would normally going with the time it
going in and that is how strongly I feel about it. Those who waited
outside for the first 15 minutes missed Gary McSheffrey's opening
goal for Coventry. But they did see Southampton score twice to win 2 1.
No FA Cup joy either for non league Tamworth, who lost 2 0 at Everton.
Or for Cheltenham Town from League two who lost 3 0 at Spurs. Or for
Shrewsbury who went down 1 0 at Middlesbrough. But all our Premier
League teams avoided any banana skins. The Albion striker Simon Cox
staked his claim for Premier League football by scoring a hat trick
against Cardiff. They'll be at home to Norwich in round four. Ciaran
Clarke scored the pick of the bunch for Aston Villa, as they beat
Bristol Rovers 3 1. They'll travel to either Arsenal or Leeds who play
tonight. And Stoke City face a short hop to Derby, after coming
from behind to beat Gillingham 3 1. And there'll be more on the crisis
at Coventry City including an exclusive interview with former
manager Chris Coleman in the first edition of Late Kick off which
returns at 11.05pm next Monday night here on BBC One.
Tamworth and Cheltenham can hold their heads up high, can't they?
There are massive outsiders and did very well.
Now the latest in what's becoming an incredible story of achievement
for one wounded ex soldier from Tipton in the Black Country.
You may remember Karl Hinett's amazing achievement of running a
marathon a week during 2012 for charity but let's just recap for a
moment on how he first found himself in the public eye.
It was September 2005 when Private Karl Hinett, just 18 at the time,
was severely burned when his Warrior tank was attacked with
petrol bombs in Basra. The former Staffordshire Regiment soldier
endured five years of surgery and physiotherapy. But he was
determined to get fit again. And at the start of last year he set
himself the target of running 52 marathons in a year to raise money
for the Queen Elizabeth burns unit. He completed his first in Zurich on
January 1st 2011 and he successfully completed his last
marathon of the year in Liverpool on New Year's Eve. But now even
tougher challenges lie ahead. Which sounds ridiculous! Karl's
with us now. What an achievement! How do you do 52 marathons in the
year? Mentally and physically it is challenging but a good foundation
of fitness and from    fitness from the armed forces got me through it.
I've raised about ï¿½20,000. The marathon is a perfect training for
that Everest which is coming next. That's next, isn't it? But you are
doing more marathons. Another 48. That will take you to around 100.
They are perfect training for Everest which I will be doing with
walking with the wounded, the charity. You have been training in
the Himalayas. We went off as a team. This is how difficult it is
going to be. Tell us what you are going through physically there,
what it feels like. Up at altitude, because our team is a bunch of
wounded soldiers, we need to contend with our injuries. Every
single one of the was injured. What sort of things are you facing
with your injuries? I will be prone to frost bite because must begin   
my skin has been damaged from the burns. What is the timescale? When
are you going to do all this? year. Everest is 10 weeks long. We
leave at the end of March. You'll have done a few marathons before
then? Hopefully another 15 also. think it is remarkable. Lots and
lots of luck. Talking about incredible
achievements ex soldier and fireman turned explorer Mark Wood is due to
complete his challenge of trekking 680 miles across the South Pole
this evening. Mark, who's from Coventry, was due to have finished
around now, but has got stuck in deep snow this afternoon. He's been
battling temperatures as low as minus 50 Celsius.
And we'll be speaking to Mark about his achievement in our late
programme at 10.25pm tonight. Luckily not minus 50 Celsius here.
week but the main difference this week will be the dominating
presence of this area of high pressure to the South and that'll
help to stabilise the winds, the direction is milder for a time and
kill of the effects of these incoming fronts from the north. So
in summary this is what the week looks like. Mostly dry, calmer and
mild till Thursday night. Now earlier on, we had some clearer
spells over us but those are going to fill in as more low cloud starts
to filter in from the West. So that may make it mistier in places
tonight and help to hold those temperatures up to around six to

is thicker that there could be some stray bits and pieces of rain. So

above average of 12 Celsius. The south westerly winds still light to
moderate. And then again very little in it between tonight and
tomorrow night   a bit of light patchy rain to the West, a lot of
cloud and reasonably mild for a night at this time of year. But

ministers hit back at David Cameron, accusing him of meddling in the
independence referendum. And here police try to fill in the
missing hours from when retired teacher Betty Yates was last seen

of your summer holidays this year but have you considered Birmingham
as a destination? The second city has been listed as 19th in a New
York Times list of 45 places to visit this year.
