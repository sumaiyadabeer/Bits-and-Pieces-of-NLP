headlines: A Greek tragedy in the making. Antonis Samaras has only
days to prevent his country from running out of money.
Japan's last ditch attempt to push through its finance bill.
The head of the European Central Bank has supported German plans for
a new currency commissioner, which would have the power to veto
guidelines.    that violate street spending guidelines.
   strict. Thank you for joining us.
The working group meeting today   what is going to be top of the
agenda? Greece. We are coming close to decision time again. Greece is
running out of money and they require this next tranche of the
bail out very soon. The Troika in Athens has found that Greece is
very far along the way on its reform promises and fiscal cuts but
there are still some serious issues remaining. First, labour market
reforms in particular. Second, how to finance a potential two year
extension of the programme, which would cost extra money which would
have to come from somewhere. When will we see some deals done
and announced regarding this two  year time frame? Last week, the
Greek Finance Minister told parliament that the two extra years
group meeting today is probably not high ranking enough to announce
major decisions. Eurozone finance ministers will meet on Wednesday
and that might be when the announcement is made. It still
might not be in the final decision. That will be up to the leaders. In
terms of running out of money, we now understand that this is a
flexible matter. But November is definitely when they must make a
decision. We will receive a decision some time... There is also
talk about restructuring the debt, which Germany is not keen on.
questioning about how to finance these next two years... There are
different ways to provide the money. One would be lower interest rates.
One would be to provide more money. The Troika would prefer to cut the
official public sector debt. It is likely that they will find
some compromise were the official sector will have some of its debt
forgiven, some interest rates will be cut and more additional money
found. Thank you.
From one debt crisis to another, Japan's national debt as a
proportion of its income is nearly twice the size of Greece's.
Spending has ballooned to cover reconstruction of areas devastated
by last year's tsunami and the shutdown of most of the country's
nuclear facilities. There has been political infighting,
delaying any possible solution to the problem.
Thank you for joining us. First, or explain how critical this
is and what it means for the Japanese economy.
On the one hand, this is irregular procedure in the Japanese
government. It runs out of tax money every fiscal year.    this is
a usual, regular procedure in the Japanese government. The problem is
that they need new legislation to make arrangements and they need a
parliamentary agreement for that legislation. At this point in time,
with political tensions as they are, this is a difficult issue. How will
politicians find any middle ground? The opposition party is trying to
use the opportunity to finally put out the government. The
government's approval rating is at its lowest point in history. The
opposition certainly has the opportunity to ask for fresh
elections. The government is trying to stick to its plans. Further
financing is desperately required. The economy is already heading to
recession. We have low demand from China and the rest of the world
economy. Also problems internally. Domestic support from the
government is very critical. All eyes are on the Bank of Japan
because the government has not been able to get its act together.
is your outlook for the economy? How will the eurozone debt crisis
affect matters? Will China's growth also affect
matters? We were also hoping that domestic demand would be stronger
this year, particularly on government spending for
Reconstruction and trying to keep the economy together. The problem
now is because of the political situation this is extremely
unlikely. The Bank of Japan will meet tomorrow and basically, the
situation is the same as in Europe and the US. Quantitative easing.
Hopefully this will have a good effect on the economy.
Staying with Japan, shares in Honda fell 6% today after it warned of
lower profits due to anti Japanese protests. The company made just
over $1 billion in the three months to the end of September. Sales in
China fell 40% because of violent protests sparked by a territorial
dispute. Honda says it expects the anti Japanese sentiment to continue
for some months. Heathrow Airport is Europe's
busiest, handling 17 million passengers per year. But its
operators are struggling to make a profit. In a few hours, Heathrow
Airport will release its latest quarterly results and it is
expected to be posting serious losses.
Heathrow Airport's operators used to be called the British Airport
Authority. They have been told to take control of so many UK airports
  Gatwick, Edinburgh and Stansted   they have decided to call
themselves simply Heathrow. Can they pull themselves back into
profit? In the first half of this year, they made a loss of $110
million. Debt accrued to $17.7 billion. The interest paid on that
debt was $600 million. Heathrow is not increasing revenue from
passengers fast enough to keep up with the interest charges.
Passenger numbers have tended to grow at 2.5% per year, roughly in
line with growth in real GDP. He from hopes that growth will
continue and increase.    Heathrow hopes. How can the company ramp up
activity at the airport? At peak times, aircraft land once every 45
seconds. It is already operating to the limit of its capacity. Heathrow
Airport's directors want to build a third runway but the UK government
has deferred a decision on this contentious issue until after the
next election. In the meantime, City, Gatwick and Birmingham have
been offering their plans to the government on how they can take the
future increase in air traffic, which Heathrow Airport will
seemingly be unable to handle. But Heathrow hopes it can expand its
capacity just a little bit more. Heathrow group's a grand plan is to
reconfigure the output's layout so that its terminals are lined up
neatly, sitting at right angles to the runway. This will make more
efficient and profitable use of the space available but the rebuild
will require yet another issue chunk of borrowing from its
creditors.    huge chunk. These are the markets at the moment.
There is absolutely no trading today later in the New York Stock
Exchange, which is closed because of Hurricane Sandy.
The government has announced it was spent another �315 million for work
on a new series of nuclear armed submarines. The new submarines are
supposed to maintain Britain's policy of nuclear deterrence but
not everyone is happy with the decision.
The British submarine firing a Trident missile in the Atlantic
last week   just a test, the first in three years. This is one of four
ageing submarines based on the Clyde, which maintain the UK's
nuclear deterrent. They will be replaced over the next decade at a
cost of between �10,000,000,000.  1474760187 pounds. The Ministry of
Defence    a cost between �10 billion... And �20 billion. �3
billion has been set aside for their design.... Kicks the Liberal
Democrats and the coalition are keen on cheaper alternatives. The
Scottish government is keen on removing the system if Scotland
votes for independence. One in five people working in the UK are paid
less than the living wage, the amount needed for a basic standard
of living. These findings also suggest that low paid workers are
feeling the worst effects of a harsh economic climate.
Coming up: Breakfast. Taking a look at what is happening across the
Atlantic with Hurricane Sandy. That is from six o'clock this
morning. This is BBC News. The headlines:
President Obama has told Americans to take Hurricane Sandy very
seriously as it approaches the east coast of the US. Michael Bloomberg
has ordered the evacuation of thousands of people from low lying
areas in New York City. This is a serious storm. My first
messages to all the people across the eastern seaboard, the mid 
Atlantic going north   take this very seriously and follow the
instructions of your state and local officials because they are
going to be providing you with the best advice in terms of how to deal
with this storm over the coming days.
In Ukraine, the governing party of President Viktor Yanukovych has
claimed victory in parliamentary elections. His party has received
25% of the rate   are not enough to take the overall majority.
A Greek magazine editor is due in court in a few hours, charged with
violating privacy laws after publishing the names of around
2,000 people who were allegedly hold private bank accounts in
Switzerland. San Francisco has won the World
Now it is time for our newspaper review where Sally and I look at
the stories making headlines around the world. Hurricane Sandy is on
the front page of the China Daily. Thousands of flights have been
suspended as America prepares for one of the worst storms in years.
With just over a week to go before the US presidential election, the
Times reports on key battleground states for the two candidates.
Lloyds reform bid to axe sales incentives is the headline in the
Financial Times. The Moscow Times reports on Aeroflot's plans to
start a low cost airline. The head of the European Central Bank, Mario
Draghi, has said he would support proposals to give the EU the power
to veto the budgets of member countries. That story in the South
China Morning Post. The Guardian reports American television network
NBC has bought the rights to show English Premier League football in
the United States for three years. To discuss these, Sally and I are
joined by Michael Hewson, a senior market analyst from CMC Markets.
Welcome to the programme. The China Daily, Hurricane Sandy, someone
describing it as once in a century weather phenomenon. Of course we
can look at the financial implications, but it is a reminder
of how powerless we are in the face of Mother Nature. One of the things
about this year, the huge weather events we have seen. You look at
Spain, you look at the drought. The weather seems to be getting an
awful lot worse. This one is closing the New York Stock Exchange.
It could be interesting. intruded a conversation about
climate change? That has kind of died down.    has it triggered.
it also brings up nuclear power. That is Brom    probably the
cheapest option. Japan has bandit, Germany has.    banned it. Where
are our energy needs going to come from? I would mention the US
presidential election. It could work in President Obama's favour.
It could make him look presidential. Commander In Chief. That the 18th
is in the Times as well.    in the Times. This remote state of Ohio is
very important. No presidential candidate has taken the race
without Ohio. All the networks are covering it. It is going to go to
the wire. The weather problems could impact of voting. Are you
surprised how quickly this race has changed? Five weeks ago people were
saying this is Obama's Toulouse. It is now neck and neck.    to lose.
Yes, it has surprised me. A lot of people in the financial markets did
not rate Mitt Romney. Despite the fact on Friday we saw a very good
GDP number. What is key is the latest jobs report out on Friday.
If that is a good number it could swing it to Obama. Is there a
candidate that the financial markets would prefer? Would they
prefer another four years of an Obama Administration? Mitt Romney
has gone on record as saying he wants to replace Ben Bernanke. That
could have impacts on the Fed's monetary policy. If the Fed decides
it wants to hold back, it could adversely affect equity markets. I
think the status quo is the preferable option rather than the
unknown of Mitt Romney. Let's be honest, he is a bit gaffe prone. I
recall the comments he made in London about the Olympics. That did
not go down too well. We will have DC. Not long to wait now. The
Financial Times, Lloyds Bank and the reforms.    have to see.. It
has cost the banks dearly, they are looking to mitigate that. They have
set aside �4 billion at Lloyd's. Replacing the practice of selling
and rewarding customer service. How are they going to do that? This PPI
thing, they estimate the final bill will be �15 billion. Three times
the original estimates. I think Barclays is due to report later
this week it will have to increase its provisions as well. It is not
just addressing this problem, it is a PR exercise. The banks are really
suffering at the moment on a multitude of fronts. LIBOR as well.
Let's look at the Moscow Times. Aeroflot will unveil a plan to have
a carrier between London and Moscow. Budget carriers could be going neck
and neck? Yes, Easyjet were looking to open a Moscow route from around
�125 return. It is a competitive market. Aeroflot, it has got a bit
of a reputation. I am not sure I would like to fly with them. Can I
say that? You just did. Before Aeroflot can become a low cost
carrier, there needs to be a change in the laws in Russia. They have to
change the requirement to feed passengers and four baggage.
think you have to pay for baggage on Easyjet. I do not think that is
an issue. Most of them are doing it. Let's look at what Mario Draghi has
been saying. He did an interview with a German magazine. I was
looking at 20 yesterday and there were dozens of comments about this.
   at Twitter. He agrees with Germany on the idea that European
officials will be able to veto it national government budgets if they
are not sticking to the rules. Very controversial. Hugely controversial.
There is a massive democratic deficit already. You are already
seeing polarisation in Spain in respects to EU demands. You have
got an election in Catalonia next month. That could be a vote on
succession. That is a key thing. They are going to have to change
the treaty. Germany wants it. will ask you very quickly, for
someone who travels back and forth across the Atlantic, are you
pleased you can watch the English Premier League on the NBC? Let's
hope they do a better job than the Olympics. There was a lot of
negative feedback about that. $250 million. Absolutely. Good stuff.
That's it. That is the newspaper That's it. That is the newspaper
review. After a bit of a mixed weekend, this week promises some
pretty typical autumnal weather. We see some rain, especially in the
south. It is breezy as well. Brighter towards the northern half
of the UK. The satellite image shows the cloud moving further
southwards overnight. Clearer skies in the north and the west. That
will continue on Monday. In the morning it is a fairly damp and
mild in the south. 4 6 degrees. It is cooler further north. A touch of
frost. It is rather mild and rather grey as we begin in the south east.
A few spots of drizzly rain. 8 9 degrees. The rain quite persistent
across the southern counties of England. One or two light showers
for the Channel Islands and some heavy rain across Devon and
