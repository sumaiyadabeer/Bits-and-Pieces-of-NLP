Good evening, Newsrounders   Hayley and Joe here taking you into the
weekend in style. Here's what we've got for you today. The universal
pictures that are out of this world. And I take on the nation's tape
ball cricket champions. But first, a new report says not
enough is being done to help children who come to the UK as
asylum seekers. Thousands of kids flee countries like Syria, Sudan
and Afghanistan to escape war and famine, and last year more than
1,200 came to the UK without their parents. The Children's Society
the way they were treated. So I've been to see what support is out
there for the kids once they arrive in Britain.
We don't know exactly how many kids come to the UK seeking asylum, but
we do know that the numbers are in the thousands. Seeking asylum means
looking for a safe place in the UK that they could call home, and
they've often come from dangerous places and travelled for months to
get here. As you can imagine, arriving in a strange country alone
where they try and help kids who arrive in the UK alone. Let's go
and meet some of the people that help. Do you think some people feel
very traumatised? Yes, absolutely. When they first arrive here, for
the children, it is very dispersing. When they came to us, we try to do
what we can.    distressing. We tried to help them as much as we
can. Sadly, we cannot help everybody. It is hoped that after
they leave this centre, the kids will feel more settled into their
life in Britain. What do you do at this school to help the kids?
have a special assembly. I think it is really good for us to get to
know them, so they are not scared, so they can settle into a our
lifestyle. It can take a while for the Government to decide where a
child will be placed permanently, and that can be stressful. In the
meantime there are community centres and schools like this to
help them settle in. Well today I spoke to the UK Border Agency  
they're the people who first meet the children arriving here. They
say they take their responsibility of care for children very seriously,
and they're already working on ways to improve the things. One group of
refugees who have certainly embraced life in the UK is the
Manchester Lightning tape ball cricket team. They're made up
entirely of asylum seekers from Afghanistan and have ended up UK
Champions. So on the day when England's pro cricket team take on
Afghanistan in their first match of the T20 World Cup, you went along
to have a chat with them, didn't you? And see who they'll be
supporting! Their bowling is fast, their batting skills are top class
and their fielding isn't bad, either. But that's what you'd
expect from the Manchester Lightening   the national tape ball
cricket champions. And for these Afghan refugees, the game has
helped them settle in to British life. This special version of
cricket is part of StreetChance   a campaign which works with the
police in urban areas lacking in green spaces, and allows young
people to concentrate on cricket and their studies rather than
joining gangs and getting involved in anti social behaviour. The game
uses a tennis ball wrapped in tape and it can be played anywhere These
players say its made a difference to their lives. The first time I
came here, I did not know anyone. When I started playing cricket, I
made friends. From playing cricket, I learnt English. I will play
anywhere, it does not matter where it is. Over the past four years,
25,000 people have been introduced to the game in seven cities. The
coach here says he has noticed the change in his players. Now, because
of StreetChance, we have lads from all over, so they're making friends
that they have never made before. Over the next three years,
StreetChance aims to get more than 16,000 young people involved. But
which team will these guys be supporting this afternoon, England
or Afghanistan? Afghanistan! that game is happening right now.
The man charged with killing two female police officers in Greater
Manchester has appeared in court for the first time. Dale Cregan was
escorted by lots of police officers this morning. He's accused of
murdering PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone and two others. Today,
Prime Minister David Cameron visited the police officers'
families. There have been more violent protests against an anti 
Islamic film made in America. One man has been killed in rioting
across cities in Pakistan. To try to stop the violence, the American
President, Barack Obama, has condemned the film in an advert
being broadcast on Pakistani TV. Now take a look at these amazing
pictures. These aren't sent by NASA from
space. These are photos taken right here on earth for the Astronomy
Photographer of the Year competition. Photo experts say the
reason the images are so striking this time is because snappers are
getting much cleverer and more creative with the shots they take.
You can see more of the pictures on the news round website. Am When we
talk about conservation projects, that often means looking at animals
like rhinos and tigers. But there are some much smaller creatures
that also need help from humans   like spiders. Nearly 2,500 fen raft
spiderlings are being hand reared at zoos around the UK, so I went to
take a closer look. For some people, coming across one spider is enough
to bring them out in a cold sweat. But what about finding yourself in
a nursery of hundreds of hungry spiderlings? This manmade spiders'
nest at Chester Zoo is one of 11 such projects across the country
right now helping to save the endangered fen raft spider. Fen
raft spiders are the largest spider native to Britain, with a 10cm leg
span! They get their name because they can float on water in the fens
and wetlands where they live. But their numbers have fallen to
seriously low levels due to their natural habitat being destroyed.
That's where Chester Zoo steps in. They've taken hundreds of eggs and
are rearing them to be released into the wild. Karan has got 372
sets of fans to feed, which means she needs thousands of fruit flies.
Why does this Biden need saving? They are a very important part of
the ecology. They will feed on and midges and mosquitoes. How bad are
things in the wild? There are only three known or pockets of wild
spiders left. Slowly it is improving, as we are releasing them
back into the wild. Last year was the first time we actually saw
these spiders breeding for themselves in the environment.
couple of weeks' time, this lot will be big enough to be released
is good news for the fen rafts. I was a bit scared, actually. Funnily
enough, she was scared of spiders One Direction have released their
new single early after an unofficial version was leaked on
the Internet. It was supposed to be released next week but got its
first official radio play last night. Live While We're Young is
the first single from One Direction's new album, Take Me Home,
which comes out in November. And here's a pop performance giving the
boys a run for their money. Gangnam Style has got over 200
million hits on the Internet and counting. It's already at number 16
in the charts here and if it keeps climbing it could be the first ever
UK number one for a Korean artist. Psy's freaky moves are so
infectious, they've even got pop princess Britney Spears busting it
