Oi!
If you leave them out too long
Full stops and exclamation marks
My words stumble before I start.
I am really proud of you, Rob Hollins, you know that?
I'm just not so sure that the panel will see it that way.
Don't care what the panel says. Whatever they throw at you,
  just remember, you did the right thing.
  I put my career on the line,
  that's what I did.
  For this family.
OK. How do I look?
Courageous and handsome.
I definitely think that this tie is going to swing it.
Have either of you seen my bag?
It's under the table.
Good luck, Dad.
What are we going to do about Immie?
It's just a phase.
  Sorry!
  Take a seat.
You OK?
It's Immie.
She's a lesbian.
She told you this?
More like shouted it from the rooftops.
See, she's met a girl at college, who, apparently, is "the one".
Karen, she's 16. It's probably just a phase.
That's what Rob says, "Just a phase." But you can't say that to Immie.
  I mean, gay people find that sort of thing very patronising.
  Yeah.
I just, I want to do this right, for her sake.
And if...she wants to be...
Then, well, you've got to let your kids get on with it, haven't you?
Yeah. I mean, that's her choice.
Mind you, I have to admit I wouldn't have been unduly worried
  if any of my three turned out to be gay.
  No?
  No.
Apart from the fact there wouldn't be any grandchildren, of course.
  It's supposed to be the consolation of growing old.
  Well, there's always Jack.
Anyway, anyone can have children these days. Even gay people.
  Michelle?
  Sorry I'm late. I got held up at the bus station.
You go away for the weekend?
  Yeah, Manchester.
  Get the bus this morning?
Er, yeah, it's a long story.
I had to give a statement to the police. Someone broke into my case.
  What? On the bus?
  Anything taken?
  No, just some jewellery.
It was in the hold. They think somebody went through the cases before it left.
No! Is there anything I can do?
No, thanks.
I'll just give a statement to the insurance company later.
Oh!
  Look, if you're worried about Imogen...
  It's not just that.
  Today's the hearing.
  Oh, sorry, I forgot. How's Rob?
He's playing it down for my sake, but if he were to lose his job...
Oh, it's not going to come to that, Karen!
And now there's all this stuff with Immie...
Listen, there's a danger of getting things out of proportion.
There's no point in you worrying about something that you can't change.
Come on, you stallion! You know it's what you want!
No, no. Oh, I think I may have been misunderstood!
Please! Please! I must go!
  Hiya!
  Hi.
  You all right?
  Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit tired, that's all.
So what did he say when you let him go?
Um, nothing, he didn't say a word.
  What, nothing at all?
  No. Which is just as well, actually.
  Cos it took me 20 minutes to get him out of those.
  Eh?
Oh, don't worry. Come here. There's a knack.
Thanks.
Here you are. Where is it?
OK. Like this, and then like that.
  Thank you.
  Anytime.
  No, really. Thank you...both.
I really appreciate what you did.
Well, hopefully Charlie will start behaving like a gentleman.
Hopefully he'll take a running jump!
We'll see.
Is it a dull ache, or does your chest feel tight?
It hurts across here.
And the, er, coughing?
Like an express train. It won't stop.
Sounds like it's bronchitis.
  Is that bad?
  Well, it's not good.
  I mean, for someone this size.
  Oh, no, not especially.
Having bronchitis does mean that you're more vulnerable to pneumonia.
But you can treat it?
Well, I can prescribe some antibiotics.
But what you really need is a thorough rest and recuperation.
Can I... ask about the bruises?
  Bruises?
  On your torso.
Want to tell me how you got those?
Are you, er, thinking of changing sides?
Paintballing?
I took quite a battering.
Look, I'm a little geezer with a big mouth. That makes me fair game.
Besides, I bruise easily.
  What is it you do for a living?
  Why?
Well, breathing in polluted air is a possible trigger of bronchitis.
Do you smoke?
Live with somebody who does?
I hear Snow White's shacked up with some other bloke these days(!)
Do you work in a factory?
Garage? The underground?
I'm out of work at the minute.
Right, well, look, it's my not business to pry.
The bottom line is that you need to look after yourself.
And that means staying away from any kind of polluted atmosphere.
This will help with the bronchitis.
And as for the rest of you...
try and stay away from any other dangerous activities.
MOBILE PLAYS "The Sweeney" THEME
What's up?
I've been on the internet and we can join a support group.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Rewind a second.
For parents with gay children.
We need to show Immie that we're supportive parents.
When she comes home wearing a pair of dungarees
then you can sign me up. Until then, stop worrying!
Rob, this is not a phase. You saw how defiant she was.
  Do we have to do this now?
  Oh, I am sorry.
Oh, I meant to ask, how's it going?
I've got to go.
Oh, you must be freezing!
  How was your morning?
  I couldn't concentrate.
  Are you free next?
  Media Studies.
  Look, why don't we go somewhere more private?
  Now?
  Lunchtime. In the park?
  It's a date.
I'll put it in my diary.
Have you got a minute?
Not a social call, then?
I have now had more than one complaint about your behaviour.
I'm not aware of having upset any of my patients.
Behaving in a sexist and intimidating manner
to any member of staff at the Mill is not tolerated.
Whatever may or may not have happened last week,
  I need your assurance...
  Is this an official complaint?
Your position here is conditional, Charlie.
So either you improve your working relationships
or you find another surgery.
Have I made myself clear?
You have my word.
And...I apologise.
Right.
Well, that's what I needed to hear.
I'll let you get on.
Course we're still on. Just went to see the doctor, that's all.
No, I'm tiptop.
He's given me some stuff.
Why don't you let me be the judge of that?
Sweet. I'll see you later.
Hello?
Alfie, it's Eugene.
  Three ladies in one night?
  He should be so lucky.
  You should be so lucky!
You should have seen the expression on his face,
  like a bunny caught in headlights!
  No more than he deserved.
Coming from a red blooded male?
A reconstructed red blooded male.
Even this ladies' man denounces chauvinism in all its forms.
Daniel Granger, a new man?
In whose universe?
OK, I will do. Thanks.
  Any news?
  I think I won't see my jewellery again.
But at least the insurance company are going to pay out.
A few months back you treated a patient of mine. Eugene Prudente?
  Who?
  He's a little person. He mentioned he'd seen you.
Oh, the dwarf? I remember him.
Did you happen to notice any physical injuries?
Any bruises, that kind of thing?
Er...yeah, he needed treatment for a dislocated shoulder.
  Did he say what had happened?
  No, it was a drop in clinic
so he was in and out. I just told him to go to A&E.
He was in again this morning, covered in cuts and bruises.
He tried to pass it off as a paintball injury, but...
Well, maybe he's into extreme sports.
  I hear dwarf tossing is all the craze.
  Dwarf...?
It's like an underground sport, but instead of you throwing
Wellingtons or phones... you throw dwarfs.
And people pay to watch that?
Apparently.
I'm so sorry. I got cornered.
Mrs Davies wanted these exhibition posters done by, like, yesterday.
It's OK. Old MacDonald collared me on the way out.
Wanted to see how I was bearing up. Since when did he care?
Maybe he kept you behind because he fancies you.
What? The guy's got a train set in his attic.
I don't think girls are his thing.
His loss. My gain.
We're not making a very good job of this, are we?
Same place? After college?
I'll be there.
  Imogen.
  What?
  So much for the R and R!
  They don't iron themselves.
You're supposed to be taking it easy.
HE COUGHS I appreciate the visit, Doctor, but I am on the mend.
  Yeah, you sound it(!)
  I'm a busy man. Can't just sit on my backside all day.
I beg to differ. Anyway, I thought you were out of work.
  Unless there's something you've not told me.
  I don't follow.
No one's coerced you into...
  What?
  Those bruises weren't caused by a few paintballs.
I'd say your injury's more consistent with being thrown about.
  And who do suppose is doing the throwing?
  You tell me.
  What did you have in mind, dwarf tossing?
  One possibility.
Being chucked about for the amusement of big guys?
Why would I involve myself
in something so demeaning to little people?
This must have cost a bit.
I wouldn't know. Look, you've done your good citizen bit.
  How long have you known Alfie Horton?
  Who?
  The man that left your building.
  Don't know what you're talking about.
He's a small time fence, well known to the police.
  What's this got to do with me?
  I wouldn't put it past him to be
involved in some kind of dubious activity if it involved money.
You mean like chucking little guys through the air? I can assure you
I've never met the man, nor am I prostituting myself for money.
Like I said, I appreciate your concern.
  Are you, um, going somewhere?
  Yeah, I'm going away for a few days.
A holiday. To rest, like you said.
Where are you headed? I could maybe give you a lift.
That must be the cabbie now. But thanks, anyway.
I'll be with you in just a minute.
Take it easy.
  Is everything all right?
  I just thought I might have heard from Rob.
I promised myself I wouldn't worry.
You don't know any lesbians, do you?
Immie thinks... SAYS she's gay and I just can't imagine what that must be like.
Really? I thought every woman experiments.
I remember I used to fancy what's her name from S Club 7.
Come on, Karen. You never fancied any girls at school?
Well, there was Stephanie Sullivan in primary school.
You remembered her name so it must've been serious!
She was just a very pretty girl. Beautiful, in fact.
MICHELLE CLEARS HER THROAT What? Nothing happened.
Anyway, I mean, I thought you knew if you were that way inclined?
Not always.
My mother would have disowned me.
  Is that how you feel about Immie?
  No! I just want her to be happy.
I'm sure that lesbian couples
  are just as miserable as heterosexual ones!
  They're probably happier.
  Men steal the remote controls...
  Leave the toilet seat up.
  Who leaves the loo seat up?
  Men. Like you.
Oh, um, apparently Daniel is "reconstructed".
We're just sharing our homosexual experiences.
Great. Can anyone join in?
What do you know about homosexuality?
You'd be surprised. And as a reconstructed man,
it'd be remiss of me not to be honest and open about it.
  Seriously?
  Yeah, it was Jason who opened my eyes to a whole new world.
  Jason?
  Yeah. We spent a whole summer together.
Used to play on the beach all day, hold hands, watch the sun go down.
This has got to be a wind up!
Course it's a wind up. Imagine me with someone called Jason?
You heard what I said on the phone. You're turning it around again.
No, I'm not.
Whichever way you want to hear it.
  You're ill, yes.
  I spoke to you...
  I don't want to know.
On your own?
Yes.
Is this about the business with the three ladies?
"Ladies" is not what I'd call them.
You can't avoid them forever.
The world has changed, my friend.
The modern workplace is full of strong minded women.
And that's not going to change anytime soon.
Division of labour worked for centuries.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. There's something wrong about
a girl who can't cope with the occasional saucy joke.
You see, that's something else you can't say.
  These are "women", not "girls".
  Margie doesn't mind the word.
Yes, but Margie was born in the 1950S.
And to be fair, she knows how to put you in your place.
All the more reason not to have to suffer
opinionated women when I'm at work.
Yeah, I can see your logic, but that won't wash here.
Have you come to reprimand me?
No. But if you can't start living in the 21st century, Charlie...
I promise to be a good boy.
  Hey.
  Hey.
  So did you get a full confession?
Er, no. Whatever caused the injuries, he's not telling.
(Um, Mrs Hobson and Laura?) So what are you going to do?
Nothing. He's going on holiday.
  Yeah, so he says.
  Yeah, I know. That's why I followed him.
  You followed him?
  Yeah, only to the coach station.
So he's telling the truth about something.
Except I didn't actually see him get on the coach.
Maybe you missed him. He is little.
Um, do you want to come through?
Can you open the hold, please?
Eugene!
Call an ambulance.
Eugene, it's Dr Clay.
Ambulance required.
No dwarf tossing, then?
I really like you.
You listen,
you understand.
You're like...the best friend I could ever have.
I hope we're a bit more than that.
Sorry.
No, it's my fault.
This is new to me.
I understand if you're not ready. We don't have to do this.
Are you going to speak in a language I understand?
  "Consolidation this, consolidation that"?
  Consolidation of the lung. It means you've got pneumonia.
You're not going to say, "I told you so"?
  You're in bed. That's all I care about.
  You couldn't let it go? Don't think you've done me a favour!
Rolling around in a suitcase at 70 miles an hour?
Breathing in dangerous fumes? You're lucky to be in one piece.
How long have you been zipping yourself into suitcases?
  Long enough to earn a decent living.
  You and the tall guy?
  Big Dave.
He travels in the bus, you in the hold?
You'd be surprised how few people lock their suitcases.
  I notice he didn't hang around too long.
  You scared him.
He's not well blessed in the brains department.
And you are? Where does Alfie Horton fit into this?
We do the stealing. He fences the goods. Everyone's a winner.
Not from where you're sitting,
do you know how many people die of pneumonia?
  Look, if you're being coerced in some way...
  Coerced?
Well, Alfie Horton, we all thought he was small time.
Alfie? The brains? Even Big Dave can give him a run for his money.
So this is all your doing?
How much longer?
How did you get into all this?
Do you know the worst thing about being small?
Not the physical effects. It's the social stigma.
And no one wants to give you a decent job.
Is that why you took the, er, alternative career path?
I figured, I can either be an angry little victim
or put my size to good use. In my world you've got to rely on yourself
and try to avoid the do gooders.
You know you're going to be charged?
If you co operate fully, you'll be doing yourself a favour.
Maybe you could do me one, too.
A favour?
A colleague of mine was on the Manchester bus this morning.
A nurse from the Mill,
the one who looked at your shoulder.
She lost some jewellery.
I'll call Alfie.
Thanks. You know there are people who can help you find a job,
  offer you social support?
  Been there, done that.
Met some people just like you. I'll get by with this.
On the outside, maybe. But what happens if you end up in prison?
If. That's up to the jury. When you're my size you can always play the sympathy card.
Thought you didn't like playing the victim?
Call it putting my size to good use.
Listen, do me a favour. When all this is over, find yourself something less dangerous to do.
  Preferably on the right side of the law.
  What do you suggest?
  Find a shovel and six other dwarves?
  You're a smart guy.
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Hey!
Hiya, love.
Just in time for cake.
Did we win the lottery or something?
Your dad has been reinstated as a sergeant.
Congratulations.
We won't mention the official warning.
Which means I won't make inspector any time soon.
Well, we can deal with that.
Let's think of it as a new start for all of us.
Right, erm, I just want to say a few words...
Only a few?
It has been a difficult time for all of us, but we stuck together,
we pulled through. So I would like to propose a toast to
Team Hollins.
Team Hollins!
Don't drink it... Do not drink it all at once!
I know I have had my misgivings about you coming out,
but I've given it a lot of thought and, the fact is,
  me and your dad are here to support you.
  So have you snogged her yet?
Jack. Stop being so insensitive!
  Will you just shut up?
  Oi!
  And you can stick your support!
  Immie?
  Don't talk to your mum like that.
  Oh!
  Can't you see she's upset?
  Karen!
And you can wipe that smile off your face as well!
Team Hollins!
Mi amor!
What?
David Hockney, Andy Warhol...
who are both gay.
  You're leaving, time to move on!
  Get off me!
I will fight you for him.
I've missed you.
