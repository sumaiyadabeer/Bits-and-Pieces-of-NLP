Welcome to South East Today. I'm Rob Smith.
And I'm Polly Evans. Tonight's top stories: A senior Pfizer scientist
says the company and the Government aren't doing enough to keep staff
and skills in the South East. The parents of a teenager who drowned
in the River Medway talk of their "living nightmare" as they help
launch a safety campaign. It has left us with this huge, huge hole
in our lives. The migrants risking their lives to
get into Britain and the officers sworn to keep them out of the South
East. We'll be talking to our reporter live in Dover as an
undercover investigation into people smuggling is screened
tonight. Passing advice on. We meet five
generations of women in Kent. Can you picture me in a cardigan?
He's still the king of cool and now an author, Henry Winkler, aka the
Fonz, passes on his unique Good evening.
A senior scientist at the pharmaceutical company Pfizer has
accused bosses at the firm of not doing enough to keep the workforce
and the skills they offer in the South East. Speaking exclusively to
Mark Norman, the scientist who works at the Sandwich Research
the Government should all put their money where their mouth is and help
Pfizer staff set up new firms in Kent. We've agreed to hide his
identity and his words are spoken To all parties, get a move on. To
Pfizer, put your money where your mouth is and help these people who
want to set up locally. Blunt words from one of Pfizer's
leading scientist. When the company leaves next year, over 4,000 jobs
will be lost, the Government and the taskforce and the company said
they want to support highly skilled staff to stay in the region, but
this man says the response from all three has been oweful.
They are slow. They are far too slow. People accepted offers abroad
and everybody knows it is over. I feel that sob needs    somebody
needs to step forward and rattle a few wages.
What evidence have you seen that people are trying to keep you here?
We have had two or three days of people visiting and giving
presentations about how to set up your own business, but when it
comes to start talking numbers, they haven't come forward.
Coming forward is what was promise bd I the politicians. This is the
the Prime Minister when Pfizer announced they were quitting.
They have brilliant employees and the Government will do everything
we can to make the best of what yes, is a depressing piece of news.
Trying to manage the problem appears to be more deusmt
Difficult. President's Pfizer is creating redundancies too quickly
for us to secure that investment. Pfizer staff appear to have lost
all confidence in that process. There is pain among people with
families, children. And mortgages and houses which have devalued.
Pfizer refused to comment to. They will close the site by the end of
20 strks but everyone agrees if we are going to retain the talented
people who work there, something When Pfizer, which is best known
for producing Viagra, announced the closure of its plant with the loss
of 2,400 east Kent politicians and trade organisations formed a
taskforce to create a post Pfizer economy in east Kent.
The Force claims without significant action from the
Government job losses from Pfizer and the knock on effects could cost
the local economy �380 million. That is nearly 9% of the region's
total output. Well, I can assure your listeners
and I can assure the workforce that we are leaving no stone unturned.
They have got to accept that Pfizer controls that site, no the public
sector or national Government. We have got to work with Pfizer to
finds solutions and fast. As pressure mounts on Pfizer bosses
to safeguard jobs and skills at the site, many local politicians fear
that the closure could affect other local businesses. Earlier this year
the taskforce presented a report to the Government on the way best way
to move forward. The authors called for Pfizer to attract new
businesses to the site. They suggested create ago new enterprise
zone. Well, let's speak to our business
correspondent, Mark Norman. These are serious allegations that have
have been levelled by the senior scientist? They are clearly only
the views of one man. The other staff have been told not to talk to
the media and many will be worried about being able to work elsewhere
in the industry and worried about their generous redundancies
packsages from Pfizer. What next then for Pfizer and the
taskforce and for the people people working at the site? The next few
weeks are critical. The taskforce hinted that the Government are not
doing enough. We have had an insight into the mood around the
water cooler so to speak at Pfizer. Many of the workers there are
already looking for other jobs. Unless things happen in the next
few weeks we will find many of the staff have left and many of the
buildings will be empty and what will see of a pharmaceutical
research and development site in Kent.
There will be more on this story on tomorrow's Radio Kent programme
with John and Clare. The family of a teenager who died
when his canoe capsized on the River Medway say they are
devastated there have been two more deaths on the same river in the two
months since their son died. Cameron Sandell's parents from
Hunton near Maidstone are now helping launch a water safety
campaign to highlight the dangers. Simon Jones joins us live from
Teston Park. Simon, I understand there was another rescue from the
river last night? That's right, at around 11am, a man in his 40s had
to be pulled from the water. It is clear despite the deaths the safety
message isn't getting through to some. It looks calm here, but just
up river is the Weir where Cameron got into trouble. He was an
experienced ka noonist, and had the right safety equipment, but when
his canoe rolled, he couldn't be saved.
Devastating consequences of the water experienced by the family of
Cameron Sandell. He was just 14. You just never imagine that you are
going to lose your child especially to something that he loved doing so
much. It has left us with this huge, huge hole in our lives and, at the
moment, it isn't getting any easier. Just six weeks after Cameron's
death, 12 year old Alex Chapel from Maidstone who had been playing oen
a rope swing fell into the water and drowned. On Tuesday, Keith
Brooke, who was 42, became the third person to die in the river in
as many months. We just know what the other
families are going through. That horrible, empty feeling that you
get when these things happen to families, you know. It is just a
living nightmare. The family is now backing a new
water safety campaign. It wasn't until recently I realised how deep
the River Medway is. It is in excess of three meters deep and it
is incredibly cold. There is the shock factor if you fall in, there
is always debris in rivers that you can't see more than a few feet
below the surface and it is easy to get tangled up in.
We just just need to make people aware that water may look inviting,
but underneath we don't know what's going on.
Saturday would have been Cameron's 15th birthday. The safety advice is
avoid areas like weirs where there are strong currents. Don't jump
into the water because you never know what is going to be below. If
someone gets into trouble and you are on the shore look for one of
these to help out. Cameron's parents say they can't believe this
A warm welcome in Crawley for soldiers from the Princess of
Wales's Royal Regiment on their A BBC Documentary will tonight show
the hardship and risks people from countries like Nigeria and
Afghanistan are prepared to take to get themselves smuggled into the UK.
Panorama's reporters also filmed with the UK's border officials in
Calais where they find on average a stowaway every day. Earlier this

John Hunt is live in Dover now. It is one of the UK's key border
crossings. John, how does the Government intend to keep the
border border secure? Well, Theresa May, the Home Secretary visited the
UK and French border authorities in Calais this month and saw the kind
of techniques they are using there, sniffer dogs and x ray machines and
carbon dioxide and movement detectors and those things appear
to be having an affect. Migrants are saying it is becoming
increasingly hard to get across the channel. In some cases, impossible
as we saw in that report. UK Border Authorities are saying they are
catching 50 stowaways a week. With plans to set up a new crime crime
agency to tackle people smuggling, that's going to get harder.
And you can see the full Panorama Kent police is plan to go join it's
IT services with three other police forces as part of a cost cutting
drive. The force is combining its computer network with Essex,
Suffolk and Norfolk police. Kent Police hope the move will save
between �3 and �4 million over four years. The upgrade of the
Thameslink line from Brighton to Bedford has taken a step forward
with the announcement that German company, Siemens has won the
contract to build new trains, the first of which will arrive in 2015.
It is believed up to 600 jobs could be created at a depot planned for
Three Bridges near Crawley. Hundreds of soldiers from the
Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment marched through Crawley today as
part of a series of Homecoming parades. It's the first time the
regiment which has been fighting in Afghanistan has marched through the
town, which is one of seven in the south east they're visiting. The
march comes on the day the funeral of a Kent Royal Marine killed in
Afghanistan took place. Sara Smith reports. Nearly two years since
these troops returned from Afghanistan, this wasn't the parade
to mark coming home from overseas, rather a celebration of their links
to the south east. Most of these soldiers are recruited from Sussex,
Surrey and Kent. So this was a chance to march in front of family
and friends. Everyone likes to show off,
especially a soldier and they are getting the opportunity to show off
in their home towns. It is the opportunity to put their shoulders
back and say, "Hey, I volunteered.". Despite the rain, crawly turned out
to welcome them. You may not agree with what is
going on war wise, but they have done a good job. You are really
proud to be British when you come to something like this.
I was in the Army myself and I knew what they had to go through. It is
great to see the British public pay their respects. It is a great
feeling. I find it an honour. People respect
us and they are behind us. While the people of Crawley turned
out in celebration, in in in Kent, the village came together for a
different reason, to say goodbye. A 25 year old Royal Marine was
killed in Helmand province last month. He was buried today with
full military honours. It is two years since these troops
returned from the war. They are on ceremonial duties at the moment,
but in the next year or so and they don't know when yet, they will
A group of women whose loved ones were left severely brain damaged
have set up a website to help other families in the same situation. Sue
Organ's husband was left in a vegetative state after a crash
taking part in the London to Brighton bike ride. Judy Taylor's
husband suffered his brain damage after a fall. Together they've
collaborated, along with three other women, to start Brain Injury
Group.org.uk to provide mutual support to others. Ria Chatterjee
reports. Charles had always been very active,' keen sportsman. Four
years ago, during a bike race, he sustained a head injury.
Complications led to a bleed on the brain. Part of his skull skull was
removed and he spent two years in hospital. Charles is totally
immobile now. He could move his right thigh, his right arm and his
leg and his head. He can't speak to us anymore. He tries.
During her time at the Royal Hospital for neuro disability, Sue
met other women suffering similar tragedies. And from their
experiences came the brain injury group. Judy Taylor's husband was
left in a investigative state after falling from the back of a van.
He had come home after being in intensive care and you look on the
internet and I just couldn't find anything from a human angle. It was
all medical terminology and I didn't understand it and so there
was no one to share it with. We didn't know anybody else. We had,
you know, the family, we could support each other, but we didn't
know anybody else who was in that situation.
This degree of integration with the loved one and by the family and
also between support groups, it makes their life so much bearable
and it has a very positive impact. It makes people feel better and
that way you are better. Sue and Charles' lives have changed.
He used to run a business. Now he needs 24 hour care. My life with
Charles before, but we had a joint social life together, now it is
Charles and me and we are going to go a long way together because you

A senior scientist working for the pharmaceuticals company Pfizer has
spoken exclusively to South East Today and said that not enough is
being done, by the company or the Government, to keep skills and jobs
in the area. The company announced that it would be closing its
Sandwich site next year. This is Henry Winkler. Please join

spent here. Where has our summer gone? Well, I
hope to shed some sunshine on that A 500 year old stately home in Kent
is using hi tech x ray machine to delve into the secrets of some of
its exhibits. Knole Park near Sevenoaks is using a machine more
often used in counter terrorism than historic restoration, using x 
rays to examine the construction of some of its valuable and fragile
furniture, and tracing the tunnels caused by woodworm and other pests.
Yvette Austin has tonight's special The treasures revealing their
secrets. Some of Britain's oldest and most valuable pieces of
furniture, plain to see from the inside out and all down to methods
used by security experts. This is a piece of kit which is normally used
for inspecting suspect bomb packages, but it can tell us a lot
about antique furniture. Round the back, I have placed a piece of kit.
It is called the detector panel. What we want to do is to take a
picture that goes through this cross frame which is covered in
cloth and it will tell us a lot about the construction of the chair.
It is the country's most important collection of furniture from the
1600s, but the x rays are showing how some items are falling apart at
the seems and others are under attack.
We have a pair of 17th century chairs. We know that these have a
history of common furniture beetle damage. You might know it as
woodworm and we can see the external exit holes. We want to see
the damage inside and also if there has been any repairs done on these
in the past. The truth is exposed in the x ray
image. We can see there has been pins put
in to help support some of the damage and also what is really
exciting, we can see some of the tunnels made by the the larva of
the common furniture beetle. Internal damage, materials used and
past repair jobs, all vital information for today's restoration
experts who hope to begin soon a 15 year, �15 million project to stop
the decay, the house itself will be worked on too.
If we aren't able to introduce environmental control and have
better light levels in the house then the current rate of
deterioration will continue to accelerate and the collection will
become beyond any conservational repair.
There is a clear determination to preserve this historic landmark in
If you grew up in the 70's, the undisputed king of cool was the
leather jacketed, motorbike riding Fonz in Happy Days. He could even
turn the jukebox on with a click of his fingers. These days, the man
behind the character Henry Winkler, is a children's author and can be
found entertaining younger generations who have no idea who
Fonzie was, but can relate to his struggle at school with dyslexia.
He has been talking to students with learning difficulties at
Valence School in Kent. Lynda Hardy He was the king of cool in the hit
TV series, Happy Days. Mary, how are you?
You never heard of me! The Fonz or Henry Winkler still oozes that
charisma. Today, he was the coolest person at school. School was very
hard for me. Spelling was hard. Reading was hard. English was hard.
Now I was great at lunch! Now a successful children's author,
Henry Winkler is touring schools, sharing his childhood struggles
with dyslexia. What do you think about him coming
to the to the school and explaining he had problems in school? It is
really good to have Henry come to the school and he inspires me in so
many ways. I want to carry on reading his books.
It is interesting to learn about the fact that how he coped with his
dyslexia. Listen, I am learning challenged.
Reading was really hard for me. I just had to to work a little harder,
that's all. For me it was getting the scripts early. Reading them
over and over again and being comfortable with them by the time

For most new mums, getting to grips with a newborn baby, the support of
their own mothers is invaluable. But one woman in Herne Bay can
count on her mother, grandmother and great grandmother for help and
advice. Carlie Ann Iddenden gave birth to baby Morgan last week. Her
birth marks the start of the fifth generation of women in the family.
Katherine Downes reports. This is 95 year old Freda. Her daughter
Beryl is 70. She is known as nanny. Then comes 44 year old Rachel,
known as nanna, her daughter 26 and she has just given birth it to
Morgan. Five generations of women in one family.
. It is really nice because there is less pressure and you have got
advice. We have all had children now. They can give you words of
wisdom as well. It is nice to have that.
Do you think it will be a nice environment for her to grow up
in surrounded by all these women? Definitely. It is a woman's world.
It is in this family, Carly's mum has four daughters, she is chief
baby sitter to her grandchildren which has taken the pressure off
the older generations. It is nice to see she is a grandma
now and got her grandchildren. It is lovely.
Does it make you feel old or keep you young? No, I think it keeps me
young. I don't feel old, but it keeps me young, I think.
I am at the    I am the last of my generation that came from the war.
But you are here to welcome the fifth generation?
and I'm glad I'm I'm here to do it. Yes, very much so, aren't we?

Friday is ever going to be remembered as fabulous Friday. I
know the ground needs a top up with rainwater, but to have 5, 10, 15
millimetres of rain falling tomorrow, it is not going to be a
pleasant day. There is your Friday afternoon. Some really heavy
showers. Heavy rain throughout the day and into the evening as well
and gusty around the South Coast. The temperatures aren't going to be
brilliant because of that. 15 or 16 at best. As we go into tomorrow
evening, we have still got that wet weather with us and for Saturday,
this is how Saturday shapes up. Sunshine and showers again. Some
sunny spells, but there will be quite a few showers and those winds
about 15 or 20mph so a breezy day. So possibly a relief that Sunday
will be the better day of the weekend. We should get lovely sunny
spells and and temperatures back where they should be at this time
of year, 19 or 20C. What about the shy summer weather we may want back
again. Well, Monday mopes in with more rain. Tuesday, is still quite
breezy. The lines at the bottom, that could be a develop high
