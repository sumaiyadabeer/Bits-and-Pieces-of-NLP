Good evening. Welcome to Have I Got News For You.
I'm Lee Mack. In the news this week  
at a training camp in London, hopes are high for a record medal haul as
Britain's elite athletes prepare for 2012.
At an Al Qaeda training camp for terrorists,
And at a conference in Geneva,
two delegates give their answer to the age old question,
He's going to lead us into the future!
On Ian Hislop's team is a young Glaswegian comedian
who recently appeared on the BBC radio show Fighting Talk,
or, as it's known in Glasgow, Talk.
Please welcome Kevin Bridges.
And with Paul Merton tonight is a former broker, Thatcher supporter
and leader of UKIP who likes his name to be pronounced "Nigel Farage",
so please welcome "Nigle Fairage".
And we start with the biggest stories of the week.
Paul and Nigel, take a look at this.
The Shadow Chancellor's debate   David Cameron on a poster.
That's Nick Clegg on the beach.
That's a very starey man in the background.Kilroy is back, look.
The suntan's back.Oh, yeah. Gosh, the future is orange.
Tony Blair made a speech the other day in which he sort of said,
"I'm back briefly. I'm not Prime Minister anymore,
"but I'm back to have a go at the Tories, and then I'm disappearing again", and that was it, wasn't it?
He appeared long enough to say the Tories are opportunistic and inconsistent   from Blair!
Then he flew off to work for a Korean oil company.
Shall we have a look at him with his opening words of his speech?
Now is it me, or is he sounding like he's spent too much time in America?
It's a wonderful pleasure to be back here at the Trimdon Labour Club
in the Sedgefield constituency...
Oh, that's a bit horrible, isn't it?
Do you think it's a good idea that Tony Blair's returned?No!
It's a ghastly nightmare.
The idea that Brown was thinking, "I'm not doing very well.
"I wonder what'll help? Oh, get Blair back!
"He's popular. Iraq went down well!"
Did anyone see the debate about Blair's speech on Newsnight?
If it was televised, yes, several people, I should imagine.
I'll rephrase the question.
Did anyone here see the debate about Blair's speech on Newsnight?
Well, we should start with the front row. Let's see...
Did anybody, not including the audience or people that work on the show apart from us five  
not including me, because I know the answer   see the debate about Blair's speech on Newsnight?No.
Not a surprise that he's coming back to try to defend his position.
It's obviously important...
A man who took us into an illegal invasion in Iraq and who has left this country less...
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.
He actually put up taxes on the poor in order to cut taxes on the middle class.
Gentlemen!
If that's all fairness, all I can say is you'd better keep him.
It's all yack, yack, yack!
Prescott really objecting to anyone who can talk properly...
He looked like Rod Hull after he'd lost his luggage.
An incredible advert for democracy, wasn't it? Three men just shouting at each other!
The big event of the week was the Shadow Chancellor's debate,
wasn't it? And a 66 year old pensioner
knocked sparks off boy George Osborne, and our dull Chancellor, so it just goes to show...
But you're coming out from the Lib Dems.
You're trying to ruin their chances!
But I tell you what   the others were desperately dull, weren't they?
It was the bland leading the bland.
Well done, Vince Cable, I think.
Well...I was going to say I thought he'd done very well,
but I'd hate to agree with you!
How come the UKIP chancellor didn't turn up?
We weren't invited.It's a scandal. It is extraordinary, isn't it?
Prejudice, bias in the media.Have you changed address recently?
Could it have gone missing?It might have done. I don't know,
but we did come second last year in the Euro elections, you know.
So we should have been invited. That'll teach you to win next time.
Does anyone know what the Tories complained about after the debate?
Yes! They said Vince Cable was standing in the middle,
and that was unfair because it made him look reasonable.
They didn't like the amount of applause he was getting.
That is correct.
So if you're in the middle, you get the most applause   is that the way it works?Not so far!
Well, you say that, Ian...
They're just trying to ruin my jokes!
Do you think that Robert Kilroy Silk,
should return to the UKIP throng?
No, I don't. I think he was...he was ghastly.Robert Kilroy Silk?
Ghastly. Sorry. Was he a mate of yours?
Yes!I apologise, but no, he was awful.
You can say what you want about Kilroy, but he knows how to present a game show.
Their fate will be in
each other's hands as they decide whether to share   or to shaft.
It's not nice, is it?
The last thing you want to hear on your honeymoon.
When he came on this show, we had some footage of someone throwing fertilizer at him,
which was followed by the immortal joke of "the shit hitting the tan!"
The election is imminent. The main parties have chosen their slogans. Let's have a look.
In a future that is fair for all...
Let us make this the year for change.
That's obviously not very fair. Does anyone know what the Lib Dems' slogan is?
Does it combine fair and change?
Have you got change for your fare?
It's  
Could it be that they had two slogans
and they couldn't work out which was the best, so being the Lib Dems they thought,
it would be a shame to exclude anybody?
Does anybody know which famous double act the Tories have brought back to help them win?
Saatchi & Saatchi.
They're famous for the advertising campaign in 1979,
with Thatcher's 79 election win, with this one  
Here is the new campaign  
That's him secured 80,000 votes.
If that wasn't enough, they have also brought out a series of posters featuring real people
and a slogan that begins, "I've never voted Tory before, but..."
Here are some examples.
Obviously, within minutes this was on the internet in a number of forms including  
Meanwhile, Labour has published a list of pledges. What have they promised?
He did one about community fairness. He's going to secure the economy.
Can't tell the difference between the two parties.
What are UKIP's five pledges?
Straight talking, straight talking. That's two.That's two.
I think we can all guess the other three.
You probably can. What are they?
Let's cut. Let's cut. Let's get rid of all the quangos and bureaucrats.
What country are the quangos from? I'm not sure. Were they a pop group at some point?
I thought you were going to say they were Belgian.
No, I am not very popular in Belgium. Why?
I seem to have upset the former Prime Minister.
It was straight talking, but they didn't like it very much.
It was more rude, wasn't it?
I thought it was normal parliamentary banter really.
You said one of UKIP's promises was you would restore British things like politeness to debate,
and then you calledhim adamp rag. Yeah.
Then said Belgium was a non country. That is true. It is a non country.
What? Compared to Britain at the moment?
Shall we have a little clip of you addressing the Belgian in question?
Er...If we don't, we have wasted the last ten minutes, haven't we?
You know, really, you have the charisma of a damp rag
and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk, and the question that I want to ask...
the question that I want to ask that we're all going to ask is, who are you?
I've never heard of you. Nobody in Europe had ever heard of you, and I can say with
confidence that I can speak on behalf of the majority of the British people in saying,
we don't know you, we don't want you, and the sooner you're put out to grass, the better.
Can I just ask, have you ever done a best man's speech before?
I thought it was quite moderate and reasonable. I don't know what the audience thinks.
How can you speak on behalf of the British people on the size of your vote?
I can say with confidence nobody in Britain knew who he was.
I knew who he was! Did you know who he was?
Yeah, that's Sven Goran Eriksson!
No, you mustn't assume the general population is as ignorant as you are.
I'll remember that then!
You're standing for election, aren't you?I am.No. Oh, sorry!
Sorry. I thought you were trying to bring me in.
Why?
Do you know anybody who is standing for election...?I think Nigel is.
There you are!
Where will you be standing for election?
I'm going to stand against the speaker John Bercow.
Isn't that against protocol in Parliament?
Only a modern protocol. I don't even know if it was. I couldn't care less.
I think it's time we told our politicians what we think.
To be fair we have seen you acting a bit bonkers in the last clip
and for partiality we have to show him acting a bit bonkers as well.
'We were out of time, but there was one more point he wanted to make.
I haven't had eight minutes. Well you have. You've had rather more.
About four times.Let me finish. Briefly.
Can we have a question from somebody else?
Briefly, If you want to ask about the Second Homes Allowance you are welcome.
The answer is simple. Do you want to go? Yes or no?
What...? Sorry?
Do you want to ask the question? Yes.Please, go ahead.
What is your intention as regards the Second Home Allowance?
I have no intention of claiming Second Home Allowance.
So, it's Nigel Farage and John Bercow is your choice in Buckingham.
Or, as it's recently been named, Hobson's.
This week saw the start of the nail biting contest,
which will end with the British public casting their vote
for the person they want to be Dorothy in The Wizard Of Oz.
And, of course, the election kicked off as well.
Tony Blair gave a speech in support of Gordon Brown.
Many commentators remarked on Tony's orange tan.
It's nothing to do with his jet set lifestyle,
it's a set up of mirrors that catch the glare of the sun as it shines out of his own backside.
All three leaders have been interviewed on national television.
When Nick Clegg turned up for an ITV interview with Mary Nightingale, he was grilled for 20 minutes,
but eventually the security guard believed his story and let him in.
Ian and Kevin, here's yours.
Oh, it's a cab.
Is Stephen Byers in it?
Yes, he is!
Hello. Five grand to go south of the river.
Butterfill.Hoon!
And that's Sir Ian Kennedy.
This is a story about the Labour MPs who got caught by a sting.
To be fair, not just Labour MPs.
It was four Labour MPs and one Tory MP, so how fair do you want me to be?
By saying four Labour MPs and one Tory MP!
I thought that was fair.
No Lib Dems.No Lib Dems.
No members of UKIP.
They weren't asked.
Asked or recognised?
But, I mean, it was an incredibly good sting.
Channel 4   Dispatches   set up a fake company
that literally said, "We're a lobbying company.
"If we give you a lot of money, will you introduce us to famous people and get the law changed?"
A parade of Labour MPs came in and said yes   starting with Stephen Byers   said, "I'll be five grand."
And then an elderly Tory MP, who I think was called Butterfill  
a terrific name for a man who's filling his boots!
What did they claim they could do for this five grand?
Basically, they said, "We can get the law changed. We'll introduce you to Tony Blair or Peter Mandelson.
"I'll get you inside the cabinet. You give us your money, as a company, we'll change the law."
Which technically is corruption.
Five grand?Five grand a day!
I know a guy in Glasgow that can do it for 40 quid.
Actually, that's NO questions asked!
Exact opposite.
Would we like to hear some of the edifying comments?Would we?OK.
That's not fair. The subtitles came up before he spoke, so he's obviously reading them.
The great thing about that is Byers having been caught.
The producer of the programme said, "We couldn't believe how stupid they were."
The office looked rubbish   there was one plant, there was a girl sitting there
with a bag with a hidden camera in it.
A sign saying, "Hidden camera."
The cameraman in the next bag, hidden.
Sound guy hanging from the ceiling.
But when Byers got caught, he immediately recanted and said,
"I was just boasting. I wasn't being corrupt."
What he was doing was lying in order to deceive people into giving him money...
..which is much better.
Byers said he'd had a word with Peter Mandelson over some food labelling for Tesco's,
but what did Mandelson say about this?
"I don't work at Tesco's. Nothing to do with me!"
Byers does get these introductions.
He does work for a lobbying company. He has got people to meet Blair.
So it wasn't all spin. I mean, these people are genuinely corrupt.
Geoff Hoon and Hewitt tried to topple Gordon Brown.
Not only do they believe democracy can be bought and sold,
but that they should determine who's Prime Minister.
Not that this should influence how any of you vote.
There's strict BBC rules about this stuff, so...
Just look at the corruption and...take it in.
That's the campaign slogan, isn't it?
What exactly Mandelson said about this   he said...
Byers later retracted everything he said after looking into Mandelson's eyes and feeling...very...sleepy...
What's the Tories' own secret weapon been up to this week?
They've got a secret weapon? By its very nature, we know nothing about it!
Ridiculous question to be asked!
"Is that the invisible man over there?" I don't know.
I think... Is it right that the Tories' secret weapon got pregnant?
I hope not!
It's Boris Johnson we're talking about!
As if that man wasn't off putting enough... Let's not think about him pregnant!
More little Boris Johnsons running around!
In what sense is he a secret?
Being the Mayor Of London and a prominent Tory.
Boris isn't a secret weapon!
Well, he's a weapon.
Unless he's one of the ones that fires and then turns around and comes and blows you up.
Here he is talking about how the Olympics will turn London into Woodstock.
Then you've got Jubilee Gardens
and right here where we are in Potter's Field, which will be slightly smaller...areas.
And we think that those will be fantastic kind of Woodstock, carnival atmosphere,
all sorts of entertainments, you know   fire eaters,
people standing around painted silver like robots...
You know the whole kind of thing!
Uh, a good few hamburgers.
He knows about as much about it as I do!
What other parts of the news have we been missing, about the MPs cracking down on something?
You had Sir Ian Kennedy. He prepared a report cracking down on allowances.
His thing said they can't have second mortgages any more and...
But they can employ members of their family? You can only have one member of your family.
You can only have one member of a family, full stop.
The others get killed   new rules.
What about twins? You have to flip a coin.
Flip the twin. Which one lands head first.
The big thing is they can't travel first class anymore, MPs.
Is there any way the MPs could buy a first class ticket,
is there any system that would allow them to do that...
Go to a railway station
where someone might be in a position to offer them   kind of thing.
Yeah, it was Nicholas Winterton who said that   MP for Macclesfield.
Sorry, who was particularly annoyed about it?
I've given you the answer. Nicholas Winterton.
MP for?Macclesfield.Well done,
You're good at this! I'm very good, yeah.
I'm going to make it difficult now, I'm going to ask the questions before I give the answer.
OK, you'll be on your own from now on.Yep, DangerMouse?
Yes.
Who was Penfold's friend... My god!
How do you do it?
It's bound to come up one day.
What Nicholas Winterton actually said was that
the people in second class were:
He said that if he had to sit with people in second class:
And saying things like, bloody hell, how much are you claiming?
This is the return of parliamentary sleaze which continues to hang around like a bad smell.
Which is what you get if no one cleans your moat for you.
Former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoone
was caught on camera offering his services for £3,000 a day.
His lawyer later said:
Yeah, using that underhand TV trick
of recording exactly what someone says.
There was controversy over the tax status
of Conservative Party donor, Lord Ashcroft.
Over recent years he has given the Tories
four million pounds of his earnings  
which, after tax, is four million pounds.
UKIP MEP Nigel Farage admitted that he has taken two million of tax payer's money in expenses,
employs his wife to run his office, paid from his allowances
and is hoping to become an MP at the next election.
Well, he certainly ticks all the boxes.
Do we get right of reply here? Yes, yes.
The money didn't go to me.
Wasn't it for your party and your offices?It didn't go to me,
it went to employees. All right, you nicked it.
So, at the end of that round...
Like to reply?
No, OK, it's fair, I accept it.
You wouldn't stand up very long in court, would you?
I didn't kill them! Didn't you? All right, I did. Go on then.
I didn't actually get the money.
And so to Round Two, the picture spin quiz.
Fingers on buzzers, teams.
Paul and Nigel?
Um... Well, I'm surprised...
I thought it was something else altogether.
They've realised that, um,
Hollywood isn't actually in America at all,
it's in Essex.
The signs are up on the A127. Are they?Yeah.
Big signs saying Basildon.
Twinned with Hollywood?
That's what they're saying. Is that what it is?
It's exactly what it is. This is news that Basildon in Essex has
put up a sign to welcome visitors
in the style of the Hollywood sign.
Let's have a look at the Hollywood sign again.
It's made of 45ft high letters and
towers over tinseltown as a symbol of the American Dream, meanwhile, here's the Basildon sign.
It's difficult to judge the scale,
but some of those letters are upwards of five feel tall.
The Sun compared the two towns. What did they say they had in common?
They've got the Basildon walk of fame  
if you've paid your Council Tax in Basildon
they put a star on the pavement.
I've got no idea!
No idea!
It's outside the Chinese restaurant. Exactly!
It's actually that each town hosts major entertainment events.
Hollywood stages the Oscars and Basildon hosts:
Speaking of grim towns, in Romania what did the mayor of Pecica
recently advise motorists to look out for?
I think that's how you pronounce it. P E C I C A.
Pecica? "Let's call the whole thing off!"
has this turned into one of those Lloyd Webber shows?
Lee Mack is Dorothy.
You said it was your turn to be Dorothy tonight.
Just be careful how you go up the yellow brick road.
Can I just ask you about this here?
The mayor of Pecica erected road signs
which warned drivers to look out for something.
Oh, for people being drunk!
Exactly right.
Cos everyone's drunk all the time.
And there was also a helpful picture to illustrate the problem:
Fingers on buzzers, teams.
The Queen's been knocked horizontal.
Um, this is, I think, despite the unusual angle,
this is the Queen wanted to visit somewhere that had stairs
and they said, "Oh, health and safety,
"you're too old to go that way."
I was going to give you the actual event  
The Royal Nova Scotia International Festival.
The owners of the festival said the ascent and descent of the steps
for someone so old, could be a potential disaster.
A tsunami, an earthquake is a disaster.
An 83 year old woman falling down the stairs is a Youtube clip.
Probably get a million for every step.I reckon.
A million hits.
I don't think that's worth a claim, you don't mean that, do you?
"Have you fallen over? Have you had an accident at work?"
The Canadians had good reasons
for banning her from climbing the stairs.
It was the Canadian military. Just shows you how bored they must be.
The 17 Steps is their Vietnam.
I mean, to make it more tricky
they could grease the handlebars, couldn't they?
I think she was genuinely offended cos every time she flies anywhere,
she actually climbs, deliberately,
the stairs into the aeroplane and out of the aeroplane.
They weren't happy at the angles.
The Canadians said that the angle was 60 degrees
and she couldn't do 60 degrees.
What are those aeroplane steps?
Oh, they're 48 degrees, don't be a fool(!)
How did a Tattoo spokeswoman
try to lesson the insult to our fully mobile monarch?
She installed a stairlift.
She claimed that it wasn't the Queen's age that was the problem,
but more that she...
On the subject of people treating pensioners like idiots,
would you like to see how Newsnight recently conducted a poll
on how to fund care for the elderly? Yes!
So if you prefer the option of paying a tax on your estate after your death
to fund social care, please start doing star jumps now.
OK, second question in our straw poll,
if you prefer to pay a voluntary insurance premium on your retirement
to fund social care, start running on the spot.
If you think you should get a bigger heating allowance, turn blue now!
In other Royal news, which part of which Royal
was recently compared to a loaf of bread?
Oh, Princess Anne's hair.
Absolutely right.
Somebody said to her, "That looks like a loaf of bread,
"and your earrings look like baps."
Or was it, "Your baps look like earrings," I can't remember.
Order!
It was one or the other.Yes, it's Princess Anne's hairdo.
A woman described as New Zealand's
foremost international fashion designer
met the princess at a party and afterwards said:
Seems a bit harsh, doesn't it? Let's see what she means.
OK, fair point.
They've even got Princess Anne's teeth on that bread, look.
Could you point out which is which? I'm a bit confused.
This is the safety obsessed Canadian officials who have...
Sorry, can I just ask, can we just spin it a bit quicker? Sorry.
I'm a very fast reader, I read ahead of myself,
that's probably the problem!
This is the safety... Slow down, you silly cow!
Sorry!
This is the safety obsessed Canadian officials who have banned the Queen
from climbing a set of stairs at the Nova Scotia International Tattoo.
The event organiser argued that 17 steps is too much for the Queen,
even though she can easily manage the Grand Staircase
at Buckingham Palace which has 47 steps.
Each with one of Charles' roller skates 'accidentally' left on it.
Fingers on buzzers, teams.
Just this hyena, and it got its photograph taken.
And, eh, put it up on his facebook.
Something about the hyena's laughter, isn't it?
That the laughter is a sort of coded...
they send messages to each other through the laughter?
They can communicate things like, "Ooh, zebra here,"
or, "Waterhole found nearby."
"Rooney doubt for World Cup."
Frustration, to summon help and organise food gathering activities.
Food gathering activities. They just strip a carcass, don't they, hyenas?
That's what they do. Get a zebra down on the ground and, whoosh!
I saw that once, happen once.
Did you?Tooting Broadway, it was.
Frightened the life out of the bus conductor.
When they see a lion, what do they actually do?"Lion!"
"Ha ha ha ha!"
Is that it?
High pitched laugh, sarcastic laugh. "Lion? Ha ha(!)"
That's not a sarcastic laugh.
I don't think hyenas do sarcasm, do they?
No, they do a laugh where they pretend they've got the joke
but they haven't really. "Ha ha..."
Like that one?
They actually giggle.
Giggle? They giggle when they see a lion.
A story of this magnitude has inevitably set internet message boards alight, of course.
What did Chris from France write on The Daily Mailwebsite?
How the hell do we know what Chris from France wrote?
I gave you a clue, I said he's from France.
Something like that?
You can't even have an imaginary cigarette on television anymore.
Can't you?No, it's banned. Really? It wasn't lit.
In other animal news, how did a goldfish make the front page of The Mail?
It's this poor woman, isn't it? Joan Higgins, her name is.
Oh, yes, you got the name right.
She sells pets, kids come in and buy pets.
That's all fine, but there's a new law that you can't sell pets to under 16 year olds, including goldfish.
She's been fined £1,000 and tagged. Tagged?
Thought it was pretty lenient, to be honest.
I don't know how many times I've been stopped on the street corners
wi' kids asking me to go in the pet shop and buy them goldfish.
She runs a pet shop, so they'll know where she is from nine till five,
five days a week, presumably.
It's that night time thing
when she's out in the pond with a big net.
To be fair though, inside the goldfish was grade A heroin.
That's not true, is it?
Well, you know, all I'll say is if you've got a goldfish, try it out.
Try smoking it?
No, you're thinking of mackerels.
Mackerels?
Time now, for the Odd One Out Round, just one between you this week.
Here's your four, they are...
Adolf Hitler,
Jonathan Ross and Jane Goldman's Victorian skeleton,
Nana Mouskouri,
and Theodore Roosevelt's pet rooster.
Do we buzz in?
BUZZ I suppose we do, don't we?
I hope somebody sold you that before the election.
Only one of them's got two heads.
Which one?
The one with two heads.
Oh, THAT one.
Is it, they're all members of the European parliament?
You're on the right track...
She was definitely an MEP.
She was.
Hitler was very keen on a greater Europe...
united in many ways   one currency, one leader.
That's a Victorian freak.
Rather sad, it's a real skeleton of someone born with two heads.
Or, two people with one body, depends which way you look at it.
Exactly.
Metaphysics now, Lee, this is much better.
Don't worry, there'll be a cock gag in a minute.
Is it about parting your hair?
Because Hitler had it there, she's in the middle,
with two heads you could get into an argument,
the cock's got a cock's comb so he doesn't have to comb his own.
The words "clutching at straws" spring to mind. It's not, no.
Well, all right, what is the answer, then?
If that was "clutching at straws" it'll be something like
they all had a butterfly called Simon.
I think I know where you're going with this,
they've all got the wrong number of certain things
that normally you would have a different number of.
Oh, surely not Hitler's testicles!Yes.
We're going into Hitler having only...
Well, being mono testicular.
I reckon there was a popular song at the time.
Can I say, "mono testicular" doesn't rhyme with Albert Hall.
Nana Mouskouri's also only got one testicle?
No, this is a magic one that foretells the future.
It sleeps in a jar by the door.
She has only got one of something though.
Liver! No, lung!
Kidney!
Heart?
You're taking that Doctor Who thing too seriously.Yeah, very.
It's to do with her profession before she was an MEP.
She was a singer, she's only got one vocal chord?
Do we know how many we're supposed to have? Two.
I've got her one.
You've only got what?I've got three, I've got an extra one.
What's the rooster got?
He is supposed to have two of something that he's only got one of.
He's only got one leg!Is correct.
So, they've all got one short
apart from the heads that have got one extra!
Exactly right.
No idea how we got that.
Do you know where they got their two headed skeleton from?
Two Heads R Us?
I'll tell you, shall I? It was a shop in Hackney.
Guess how much it cost.
Well, what would you normally pay for a two headed skeleton?
Um, do you buy one get one free?
That would cost about £850.
No, £2,000.No, don't be ridiculous. Nonsense.
It's like a freak show version of Cash In The Attic.
It's actually £1,500.
£1,500.And Adolf Hitler is commonly rumoured to have had only one testicle,
can anyone tell me what happened to the other one?
It was shot off in the war. He was wounded in the First World War.
Medics gave him a nickname. What was it?
It was Screamer.
Oh, that German sense of humour.
What, cos he was screaming in agony?
Yeah.Oh, great. No wonder he started the next war!
Who wants to see the one legged rooster?
No.We do.
It could be just sideways on, couldn't it, I suppose?
Or the floor could be really hot.
The answer is they all have only one of something
they should have two of, apart from Jonathan Ross
and Jane Goldman's victorian skeleton, which has two heads
but should only have one.
It's official   Hitler only had one ball. This is according to a German army medic who saved the Fuhrer's
life during the First World War.
Though there is as yet no evidence to support the claim
that Hitler's mother, the dirty bugger, chopped it off when he was small.
The medic claimed that Hitler lost his...Any news on Goebbels?
Did he have none? Second verse.I don't know.
I know someone had something similar but I can't remember...Himmler.
..rhymes with "similar".
Well, you probably knew that. I did know that, yes.
The medic claimed Hitler lost his testicle as a result of an explosion
during the First World War. And then he joined UKIP.
I'm joking! I'm joking.
The medic claimed that Hitler lost his testicle as a result of an explosion during WWI.
Presumably the same explosion that blew the ends off his moustache...off.
It's a very hard sentence to say, that.
"Blew the ends off his moustache." The moustache should be the last word.
That would be better. But now we're all very familiar with the concept...
it may be a bit tricky to get it across as a gag.
Hey. Watch this.
I like a challenge.Yeah.
Knock knock.
Please yourself.
Theodore Roosevelt famously lent his name to the teddy after refusing to shoot a bear while hunting.
He opted instead to discharge his gun harmlessly to one side...
and shot the leg off a passing chicken.
The Missing Words round this week has as its guest publication...
Taxi Talk, a magazine which even Daily Mail readers look at and go, "Steady on."
And we start with...
Not taking illegal immigrants,
cos there's too many of them in this country
and it's about time some of us made a stand and said,
they shouldn't be here, they've got to go back.
It's got to fit into that bit there. Oh, sorry.
I just got a bit carried away.
It's...
This is a magazine...
If YOU don't know I'm not sure how the message is getting across.
I must be a bit out of touch, mustn't I?
UKIP? Surely not.
This is a magazine advert for UKIP's own range
of Keep The Pound dressing gowns.
Perfect for those special times when you want to rant about Europe AND relax.
They look terrific.
But only the person you go to bed with sees this  
if you had a normal jacket you could walk down the street... and get attacked.
Most people that vote for UKIP are walking down the street in their dressing gown.
Are there "For Her"? Are there not an equivalent...?
Do UKIP allow women to vote(?)Oh...
We're terribly modern and liberal about that sort of thing.
It's also ideal for that hotel trip when you've been upgraded to a room with extreme views.
Oh...!
Next...
Ipswich.
Ricky Martin?Ricky Martin...
It's actually...
Next...
Gives Anne Boleyn a tan.
Has Blair as new client.
Was there some story about Jordan moving out of her house...?
God, I'm so embarrassed to have read this.Of all the people...
Of all the people I wasn't expecting to get this answer!
She's moved out of her house, apparently,
because "it's haunted".
This story's totally untrue, and it's filled up four pages of the Star.
Is the sunbed haunted? Or the house is haunted?
If you're moving out because the sunbed's haunted, just get rid of the sunbed.
You did hear the bit where I said "Jordan", didn't you?Oh...
Could have been worse   "Haunted Sunbed Forces Jordan To Invade Israel."
Now, that WOULD be a story, wouldn't it?Yeah.
And is that right?
Yes. It's exactly right.
This is the story that Jordan's sunbed is haunted.
..said the ghost.
Next up...
Dalmatian.
This gecko is so well camouflaged that no one's ever seen it before.
It's a very rare creature. Or there could be billions of them.
So, the final scores are
Ian and Kevin have 5 points, Paul and Nigel have 7 points.
Before we go, the Caption Competition. Ian and Kevin have this...
"Massive dog."
Erm...
We'll go for "Massive dog."Yeah.
OK. Paul and Nigel get that...
"Invisible gecko claims first victim."
Is it him saying, "Her Majesty can't possibly step over HIM"?
The Queen could move diagonally on the floor, couldn't she?
On which note, we say thank you to Ian Hislop and Kevin Bridges,
Paul Merton and "Niggel Farridge".
Nigel Far AAGE.
And I leave you with news that despite the success of Sport Relief,
next year they won't be doing a skip a thon with James Corden.
After the success of BBC's Inside John Lewis, a new documentary goes behind the scenes at Dixons.
And as Google Street View extends to rural Britain, a local resident asks for his identity to be obscured.
Good night.
Some people in the audience are watching a football match!
Does anyone know the Arsenal score?
One nil.
One nil? To...? Arsenal?
Barcelona.
Cheers.
It's obviously one of our top recordings(!)
Cos otherwise... Two nil to Barcelona.
Even YOU'RE bloody watching it, you're working here!
Actually it IS two, I've got it on here.
There's only Ian not watching it, we're we're all watching it.
