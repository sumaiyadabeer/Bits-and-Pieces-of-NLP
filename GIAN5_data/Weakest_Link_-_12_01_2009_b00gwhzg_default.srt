Here are the nine contestants preparing for today's show.
Only one of them will win up to £10,000.
The others will leave with nothing when voted off as the weakest link.
Welcome to The Weakest Link.
Any of the nine people in the studio today could win up to £10,000.
They've only just met,
but to get the prize money, they'll have to work together.
However, eight will leave with nothing...
Let's meet the team.
My name is Antony, I'm 29, I'm from Solihull
and I'm opening a teashop.
I'm Vonny, I'm 62, I'm from Oxfordshire
and I'm an ambulance driver.
I'm Simon, I'm 41, from Sunderland and I'm a cable jointer.
I'm Valerie, I'm 59, I'm from Leamington Spa
and I'm retired.
I'm Nigel, 36, from Whitchurch in Hampshire
and I'm an RAF helicopter pilot.
I'm Claire, I'm 42, I'm from Stillington, North Yorkshire
and I'm a quality auditor.
I'm Peter, I'm 61, I'm from Dunoon, Argyll,
and I'm a contact centre team manager.
I'm Holly, I'm 20, I'm from Wakefield and I'm a student.
I'm Stephen, I'm 54, I'm from Leicester
and I'm a cathedral canon precentor.
OK, just to remind you, in each round, there's £1,000 to be won.
The fastest way is to create a chain of nine correct answers.
Break the chain and you lose all the money in that chain.
Say "bank" before the question is asked and the money is safe.
Round One, three minutes on the clock,
we start with the person whose name is first alphabetically,
that's you, Antony. Let's play the Weakest Link.

That money will go through to the next round,
but one of you will not.
Whose disk may go floppy?
Whose study partner is, perhaps, Jordan?
One of you is about to leave with nothing.
It's time to vote off the weakest link.
In an impressive first round, Antony is the strongest link.
The weakest link statistically is Vonny,
but who will the players vote off at this early stage of the game?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.

No, I've got quite far. I'm signing the lease this week, hopefully.

I used to live in Taiwan, Republic of China.
I'm hoping to bring Chinese tea to the people of the Midlands.
What sort of tea do they drink at the moment?
I'm guessing mainly tea bags.
Describe your teashop.
It's contemporary, stylish, it's in the middle of a mall  
or it's going to be.
Big?
Seats about 40 people.
Have you got a wife to help you?
  No, I have a business partner.
  Oh.
  Who's that?
  My good friend, Steven.
  Steven?
  He's out in Taiwan.
  Do you live with Steven?
  I don't.
  Do you like musicals?
  Not particularly.
  Don't you?
Do you have lots of girlfriends?
  I wouldn't like to say.
  Why not?
  Cos I'm on air.
  Do you make your own tea at home?
  I do.
You live on your own then, do you?
I'm back living with my parents at the moment.
  Oh, so this is Antony   how old?
Antony, 29, who lives with Mummy and Daddy
  and doesn't have a girlfriend?
  That's right.
Why do you want to get rid of Claire?
Is it her dazzling smile?
I have no reason for picking Claire, other than she was next alphabetically.
I told myself if I had to make an arbitrary decision, I would do it next alphabetically.
  Where are you from, Simon?
  Sunderland, Anne.
  You don't sound as if you're from Sunderland.
  Not originally.
I spent the first 20 years of my life in Birmingham.
I'm sorry about that.
  What do you do in Sunderland?
  I'm a cable jointer, Anne.
What does that involve?
Er, I join electric cables together, to fix them when they're broken.
Oh, I see. You lay cables. How many cables do you lay a day?
  No, I don't lay them, Anne.
  You never lay a cable?
  I used to.
  I've progressed now, to joining them together.
  How long is it since you laid a cable?
  It must be 15 years, Anne.
  Oh, dear!
  Why Claire?
  No reason at all, Anne. I just had to pick somebody and unfortunately, I picked Claire.
What do you do, Holly?
I'm a student.
  Are you?
  Yep.
Where did you learn to have that squeaky voice?
  Wakefield.
  Did you?
  Yep, born and bred.
  That's what they teach us there.
  What university are you at?
Loughborough.
  Oh! That's that thick university for sports types.
  That's about right, yeah.
So, are you doing sport?
No, I'm doing Publishing with English.
  So, you're going to be a publisher.
  No.
No, of course not(!)
I don't know what I want to do. I'd like to present the Weakest Link when you retire.
  But your voice is too squeaky.
  I know. I'm sorry.
  You have to stop smiling.
  All right.
  You can't possibly say things like, "I'm sorry".
  OK. I'll be mean.
  You can teach me how to be mean.
  I'm sorry?
Will you teach me how to be mean?
You know how you were born with a squeaky voice? I was born mean.
Fair enough.
Stop smiling if you're going to be the presenter of the Weakest Link.
  Now, say, "You are the weakest link, goodbye".
  You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
That didn't scare me, Holly.
Have another go.
You are the weakest link, goodbye.
  That's a bit better, but I think you'd have to practise.
  Can you do it in a lower voice?
  No!
Just try lowering your voice.
  You are the weakest link, goodbye.
  Much better!
Why Claire?
No reason, I just thought of someone. No one got a question wrong.
Claire, you are the weakest link, goodbye.
Realistically, I think I would've made it into the final two
and I am upset that I haven't made it today.
I was really annoyed at Antony's reason for voting me off,
which was that I was next alphabetically.
I'm unfortunate my name begins with the letter C.
Round Two,

We're taking ten seconds off the time. We start with the strongest link   that's Antony.

Who thinks Peking duck is an Olympic sport?
Who thinks American Express is a fast train?
It's time to vote off the weakest link.
Simon is the weakest link as he gave the most wrong answers.
Statistically, the strongest link is Antony.
But will the voting reflect reality?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Simon.
Simon.
Holly.

  Yes, I do.
What does your job involve?
I organise... I'm head of department of all the worship and music.
  Does that mean you can sing in your job?
  I can.
Really? How well can you sing?
I'm an opera singer by past profession.
A lot of people come on this show and say they're opera singers.
  I'm sure.
  Quite a lot of them aren't.
  Oh, right.
  So, we need to think of something for you to sing.
I can sing some opera for you, a duet.
Are you going to sing both parts?
No, I thought I'd just lead you in.
No. No, no. You do the singing and I'll do the criticising.
  That's how it works on here.
  That's fine.
Can we have an opera with a tune?
Er, yes.
OK, what is it?
  Don Giovanni.
Do you want it now?
When were you thinking of?
  That's fine.
  OK. Crack on.
La ci darem la mano La mi dirai di si
Vedi, non e lontano Partiam ben mio, da qui.
That's very nice.
What did that say?
Well, it's about taking a young lady up to a shack on the hill.
Oh, no, that might be too dirty. Why Simon?
Well, he got two questions wrong, Anne, I'm afraid.
What do you do, Vonny?
I'm a part time, non emergency ambulance driver.
So a not very important ambulance driver?
I'm quite important to the people that I carry around.
  Where do you do your job?
  In Oxfordshire.
Do you have people being sick in the back of your ambulance?
Um...
It has happened in the past and unfortunately, I had to give them my lunchbox,
  which was on the seat by my side.
  What was in your lunchbox?
Fortunately, I'd already eaten my lunch.
Oh, so you weren't giving them something to eat?
No, but after he'd...
Here's a tip.
What if you... No, no, Vonny, this will be helpful to you.
What if you took two lunchboxes, one with your lunch in...
..And one for people to be sick in?
Well, yes.
Why Simon?
  I'm afraid Simon did get two questions wrong.
  He did.
But he used to come from Birmingham.
Simon, you are the weakest link, goodbye!
I definitely expected to get further than Round Two,
but obviously you've got to get the questions right to get further than Round Two and I didn't.

Oh. Big helicopters?
  Very big, Anne, yeah.
  Hmm. Put your board down.
  So, have they got any wings, these helicopters?
  No, Anne. It's a helicopter.
  Oh!
So how does it go?
It's two rotors on top, Anne.
  OK. Show me. Pretend you're the helicopter.
  You want me to be a helicopter?

So, in Dunoon, you put a dot on the top of your Ls, do you?
It was just to decorate the plate.
I hope everyone at your call centre is looking at that, and you're their boss.
Why Valerie?
  Because she got a couple of questions wrong.
  Valerie, you are the weakest link. Goodbye!
The question about the bird, I'd actually stopped listening by that stage
and all I heard was the W, and I'd gone on another planet.
I wasn't there at all, really, but... Hey, ho.

  Vonny, why Holly?
Unfortunately, I think she was the weakest in that round.
She didn't answer a single question correctly.
Holly, you are the weakest link. Goodbye!

  OK. So why Stephen?
  He got a couple of questions wrong, I think.
  You don't like singing vicars?

When the vote's tied, the strongest link has to cast the deciding vote.
  Little teashop Antony. Why have you voted for Stephen?

Stephen, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
My wife will be really annoyed at me getting the Jingle Bells question wrong,
