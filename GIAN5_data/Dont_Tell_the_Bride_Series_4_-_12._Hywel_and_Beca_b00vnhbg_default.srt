This programme contains some strong language
Hold on to your hats. This is Don't Tell The Bride.
  What do you think?
  You look really nice.
  Do I?
  Only the bravest of brides...
  I'm really scared.
..would let their groom organise the biggest day of their life...
  ..alone.
  She's going to love it, I know she is. But she'll probably kill me.
The grooms get Â£12,000.
And the brides get no say in how it's spent.
With a million ways to splash the cash...
I got married on a battleship.
..and a million things to organise...
  I don't know what she wants.
  He's well stressing me out.
... can the guys pull it off in just three weeks?
I can't do it.
And will it be for better...
Or for worse?
After 10 minutes, I want to get it off.
This is hell on earth.
  Tonight...
  Rock and roll.
Indie boy Hywel goes all out to rock his bride to be Beca's world.
Oh, my God!
Will he cock up her hen night?
I'm going to kill him!
Will he remember it's a wedding, not a rock festival, he's planning?
Tables named after bands, tickets for invites.
Glastonbury, welcome to South Wales.
Or will all his efforts be laid to waste...
Really heavy downpours.
..by the wet Welsh weather?
Not good. Not good at all.
Can this man give this woman the wedding of her dreams?
I just don't feel comfortable in a wedding dress.
It's only rock and roll, but I like it.
Today, 28 year old trainee social worker Hywel is moving out of the house he shares
with his 29 year old fiancee Beca, who's a civil servant.
Can't forget my Batman pyjamas.
No, mustn't forget those.
Beca and Hywel live near Bridgend in South Wales.
They went to the same school, but met again 10 years later.
'We met in a night club locally.'
Beca gave me a false name and said I didn't earn enough money to keep her in the luxury she's accustomed to!
I was only joking, though. Don't make me look shallow!
Despite the rocky start, they quickly became an item.
We went on a couple of dates, and it was like the big romance, really, wasn't it?
  Yeah, it was quite whirlwind, wasn't it?
  It was a whirlwind, yeah.
After just 11 months together, Hywel popped the question at a Blur gig.
I looked at Beca, I just thought the moment was right and I got down on one knee.
I said, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you, will you marry me?"
And she just started laughing and said, "Get up, you idiot!"
I just thought he was drunk, but when we spoke about it later we did decide we love each other,
we want to be together forever, so why not get married?
Deciding to get hitched to Hywel is a big decision for Beca.
She was married before at just 19.
'We didn't last very long, it didn't go very well.'
I was young and silly and thought I knew it all, and everybody was telling me not to do it,
so that made me want to do it even more.
'I don't really regret it, cos I've got my son, and he's the best little boy ever.'
Ready? That's a good one.
Alex is now seven and the apple of his mother's eye.
He's just the most amazing, special little man, and he loves Hywel and Hywel loves him,
and they get on so well, which is lovely.
The pressure is on for Hywel to make things perfect this time round.
And the bride's got very clear ideas of what she expects.
We're both jeans and T shirt people,
so I think our wedding should be really classy,
really chic and elegant.
But unfortunately for Beca, Hywel's style is more Britpop than classy.
My personal style is formed, I suppose, by the musicians who I like,
the sort of style they base themselves on as well.
And his idol is the former Verve frontman.
He worships Richard Ashcroft.
He has been known to wear big beads around his neck and a big crucifix,
and a black shirt undone to the chest, just like Richard Ashcroft, so he can look like him.
I totally want it to be perfect for her second time around.
I'm going to do everything in my power to make it the best wedding ever.
'I've got a feeling there are some things he will slip upon, which I'm dreading,'
but it is quite important because we're only going to do this once, so I really want him to get it spot on.
It's time for the couple to say goodbye.
Do a good job.
  I'm going to miss you.
  I'll miss you, too.
I'll see you in three weeks, we'll be husband and wife.
  OK, go now before I change my mind.
  OK! Ta ra.
  Bye.
The next time they meet will be at the altar.
Hywel's moving back in with his mum.
  You all right?
  How are you? Here we go, then.
Very rock and roll.
Fortunately for this frontman,
back up is on the way in the shape of best men Tom and Spencer.
Spence!
Unfortunately, Spencer's speciality is waste, not wedding planning.
Believe it or not, I had Binman of the Year 2009, 2010,
so I'm a brilliant binman, but crap at organising weddings.
Tom works for an online beauty store, and is convinced he's going to be more help.
Whether it's beauty creams or dreams, I think I'm Hywel's man.
With his band in position, it's time for Hywel to talk them through the gig.
Big idea, really, for the wedding is it to be a rock festival wedding, right?
'Live music, for me, is amazing,'
particularly Glastonbury festival,
which I make my pilgrimage to every year, and have done for the last three years.
Tables named after bands, tickets for invites.
I want to bring Glastonbury to South Wales and have music, laughter, life, fireworks.
'That's the idea I'm looking to pull off, really.'
I hope he doesn't really go for a themed wedding.
I just want to keep things simple yet classy.
So we want to be big, bold, spectacular, legendary, right?
Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have some fun.
Yeah!
And, on that, ahem, note, it's time to celebrate  
in true rock and roll style, of course.
Radio ga ga!
In your head, in your head They are dying
In your head...
But what goes up must come down.
I'm feeling fragile, to say the least. Bonkers.
One Chardonnay too many.
I fell asleep last night with my contact lens in, so my eye is really, like, poo.
My hay fever's playing hell with me, as well, so, all in all, I ain't tip top.
It's the worst possible start for the boys.
They're nursing hangovers when they should be finding a venue.
I feel like death warmed up.
Revived by a strong brew,
the lads head off to Cardiff in search of a stadium to rock.
And there's only one venue that this Cardiff City fan will consider.
Can't you just picture the adoring crowds?
  Awesome, isn't it?
  You can have pictures in the dugouts, and in the stands.
It's a nice photograph to have on the pitch with all your guests up there, cheering.
How many wedding guests is he expecting? 26,000?
Have you got a band in mind for your evening?
Yeah, well, we'll see if we can get the Stereophonics, Manic Street Preachers!
Hywel's clearly in la la land.
The bride and her chief bridesmaid, Rayner, are doing some dreaming of their own.
Hello, welcome to the Great Western.
Pleased to meet you. Let me show you around.
'My dream wedding would take place in a country mansion,
'rolling green lawns outside for lovely photographs.'
All the men in tux and the women in cocktail y gowns.
A vintage style, Breakfast At Tiffany's kind of look.
Just simple, classy, elegant, stylish. That's what I want.
The boys head off to check out a marginally more modest venue.
Rock and roll!
A marquee on a farm could be just the ticket for Hywel's rock festival concept.
Have you got any idea of what sort of theme you want?
  I want a festival theme, a music, rock and roll theme.
So it's perfect with the grounds being on a farm similar to Glastonbury.
It's a cool venue. I like the marquee, it falls in line with what we're looking for.
Yeah, just like the Pyramid Stage(!)
That's fitting in very well.
  Right.
  It's a cool venue, I'm liking it.
It's really classy, it's just the kind of thing that I want.
  It's lovely, isn't it, Rayner?
  It's beautiful.
This is our poolside lawn area,
where we serve arrival drinks after the civil ceremony, so it's a chance for your guests to all chat together.
Yeah, I'd like the staff to be carrying round trays of champagne.
I think it'd be stunning.
That's no swimming pool, it's a muddy trout lake.
Get bales of hay around the place as well.
Bales of hay outside is absolutely fine.
And obviously the farmer, you could ship them over?
  Sort that out? That'd be wicked.
  What do you think, how does it look?
Stunning. Simply stunning.
  Marvellous.
  Did he ask you, or me?
How would it make you feel if Hywel chose a place like this?
I'd be absolutely over the moon.
It would just be everything that I want, I would be so happy if he chose a place like this.
I just hope he has!
I think this venue could be the ticket.
It falls in line with the theme, and the surroundings are stunning. This could be it.
Onwards and upwards.
There's just one small problem.
The marquee doesn't have a marriage licence, so Hywel still needs somewhere to get married.
And he's only got an afternoon to find it.
Fortunately, Dyffryn Gardens is just down the road.
It's an ornamental garden based on a Roman design.
This is where the ceremony is held.
That's lovely.
So, you get exclusive use for 45 minutes for the ceremony,
  so it's blocked off for about half an hour before that.
  Right, yeah. Stunning.
It is beautiful. You could decorate it and dress it how you like.
OK, amazing.
What happens if it rains?
If it rains, I'm sorry, it's an open air venue, that's one of the things,
  you have to come prepared that it could potentially rain.
  Right.
Even festival lover Hywel won't gamble on the Welsh weather without taking a rain check.
But, later that evening, he decides to take the plunge.
All the best, cheers, mate.
Congratulations, boy!
The plunge! The plunge!
Hywel splashes out over six grand on an outdoor ceremony and a marquee on a farm.
Hywel, it's a great choice, I'm telling you, pal.
It's going to be awesome. We're going to make it a day to remember.
Glastonbury, welcome to South Wales!
Let's hope Beca remembers her wellies.
Today, the bride to be and bridesmaid Rayner
are in Cardiff on the hunt for Beca's dream wedding dress.
It's an emotional moment for Beca, whose mother passed away five years ago.
My mum and dad were still together when my mum died.
They had a very happy marriage, they were together since they were 17,
and they loved each other very, very much.
So I wouldn't want to settle for anything less than what my mum and dad had.
  Hiya.
  Hiya, nice to meet you.
Let me show you some dresses, then.
Beca wants an elegant Breakfast At Tiffany's wedding, with a Holly Golightly dress to match.
  What do you think about that one, then?
  No.
  No?
Too much skirt and too much detail, and too much bows.
No, don't like that one.
What I had in mind was sort of like
just really classy and chic and sophisticated.
The boys are in Swansea, and Hywel's on a mission to prove that he can pick the dress of Beca's dreams.
Things are moving fast and furiously now into the third day of things.
Looking sharp is my forte, let's put it that way. Woo hoo!
  So it's all down to you, Hywel?
  It is, it's all on my shoulders.
  Have you got a theme for the wedding?
  I have got a theme for the wedding, yeah.
I'm looking to do like a rock festival wedding.
I could have just the dress, then.
It's called "rock and roll".
  You're joking?
  No!
And those are the magic words.
This is the rock and roll dress.
That looks wicked.
We've got some more Ian Stuart gowns here.
  That's...quite a dress.
  I don't get that.
I don't want all the glitz and glamour and all of that.
She'd be like the marshmallow man on the Ghostbusters film with that on!
And the marshmallow look isn't one his 5'0" bride can get away with.
How does it make you feel?
Is it not you?
I don't really know!
  I don't think it is.
  Turn and face me.
It's everything I thought I wanted for the wedding
but now I have got it on, it's just not me.
SHE GASPS That looks beautiful on you.
A bit weird, isn't it?
I'm really worried about Hywel choosing my dress now,
because I thought I knew what would look good on me
and I've tried it on, and they don't look good at all.
Beca is trying to channel her inner Audrey Hepburn.
Do you feel comfortable in something so fitted, Bec? No?
I just don't think I feel comfortable in a wedding dress.
Now this, I love.
This is the rock and roll one.
Yeah, it's wicked, it's an absolutely beautiful dress.
It's only rock and roll, but I like it!
This is the third dress.
As good as it is, it's not rock and roll, know what I mean?
Blinded by his rock festival theme, Hywel is refusing to consider any alternatives.
I think the gown for my girl is rock and roll.
  Absolutely.
  So let's rock and roll!
And if you can give me a rock bottom price, including their hair flower, the dress and the shoes,
yeah, we could be in business?
I could probably do a 50% deal on that.
  Is that a deal?
  Deal.
Let's shake hands.
It is an impulsive move from the indie rocker.
Hywel has spent Â£700 on the first dress he saw,
on the basis of its name.
It might be rock and roll, but will she like it?
It's Beca's hen night.
  Hi!
  Hello!
But as Hywel has spent seven grand in under seven days,
he's got to economise somewhere.
So he blags a favour from stepdad, Steve, who runs a business providing an unusual kind of pampering.
There will be screams going on everywhere, it will be bonkers.
Surprise, surprise!
Let's Go, Batman!
  Has Matthew not given you any clues?
  Nothing at all, Becks, it's doing my head in.
I've been trying to text him to find that what is going on, but nothing.
My little heart is like... ba boom, ba boom, ba boom!
Her little heart would skip a beat if she knew what was going on in Porthcawl at her dad's B&B.
There is something fishy going on round here.
Theme from "Jaws"
  Are they hungry?
  They are looking really hungry.
Starving, you can see.
Well, a couple of hours, they will be getting fed.
Awww! Do I have to?
Yeah, you have to.
Put that on.
There is no fancy transport for this hen.
It's a minibus!
It's a minibus!
He is so fucking tight getting me a fucking minibus!
This is the way to my father's!
Oh, my God, look at that! Oh, my God!
But there will be topless waiters.
Ooh, it's a bit nipply out!
Thank you!
OK, smile!
Time for the pamper party to begin.
With a Piscean pedicure!
I'm not putting my feet in there.
I'm not doing it!
I don't like fish!
  Oh, my God, oh, my God!
  I'm not doing it.
Oh, my God!
No, no.
It's like you've stepped on, like, poppadoms.
It is all in a day's work for these specially bred garra rufa, or doctor fish.
It's really weird. It is fab, I love it.
I'm going to kill him!
'I wanted something really special.'
I really thought he would go all out for me so I am really disappointed.
'I am so worried now, what he has done for the wedding.'
If he has done this for my hen do,
I am so worried about what the hell he is doing.
The start of week two, and Hywel is motoring through his wedding planning.
Today he is tackling suits.
With his best men back at work, Hywel has found himself two other advisers.
Rhodri Bwye, known as Bye bye, and soon to be stepson, Alex.
I want him to look really smart and scrubbed up.
I want him to wear a tux.
What I'm thinking is, right, Bye bye, I reckon a vintagey brown looking suit.
  That type of brown definitely matches your personality.
  Yeah?
I take that as a compliment. D'you reckon brown is the way forward?
  Yes.
  Good.
This is the chocolate brown.
  If you would like to try that on?
  That is what I'm after.
Mud, Glastonbury, it is all about me.
Hang on? So he's actually matching his suit to the Glastonbury mud?
That's taking devotion a step too far.
Heaven knows what he's matching his footwear to!
You will certainly be noticed with those shoes!
I'm liking the suit a lot, buddy.
The waistcoat and tie looks really nice.
I've got a Cantona collar on!
  I'm liking that.
  Are you?
I'm loving the colour of the suit. I'm loving the tie option as well.
Easier to do in the morning, that, because cravats are carnage.
I don't know about those, buddy.
It does take away from the classic look of the suit.
I'm coming round to that. When I first saw them, I thought, what's going on there?
But I reckon when the suit size is right, and it's all proper fitted,
I think I'm just going to have to make a call on the morning of the wedding, really.
It looks a bit like Doctor Who.
You could be David Tennant and I can be Matt Smith.
I like where you're coming from. We'll get the old sonic screwdrivers on the go, yeah?
I'm feeling it.
  The choice of what you have chosen is excellent, it's lovely.
  I reckon it's the business.
Will Beca see the humour in her Time Lord's colour scheme,
or come the wedding, will she want to exterminate him?
This groom has gone full throttle at the wedding planning for the past week and a half.
He has booked two wacky venues,
bought the first wedding dress he saw,
plumped for a mud coloured suit
and added random yellow trainers.
He has also sorted a registrar and coaches for his guests.
I need 50 seater buses.
And ordered a replica of the Glastonbury Pyramid Stage, as you do!
It's a bit crazy!
As a result, he is in danger of busting the budget.
I have spent Â£10,548, so the first half of organising the wedding
I really went out like a bat out of hell really and spent a lot of money.
Still a lot to do from the tight budget, isn't it?
But there's no rest for the wacky.
This festival junkie splashes 400 quid on flowers.
  They are dandelions, are they?
  No, they are gerberas.
Blows 400 of his own money on a band.
What is your availability, can you check your diary?
Unfortunately, the Stereophonics aren't available.
And with the help of his third best man, Joe, turns his mind to transport.
I'm thinking something a bit wacky, a bit different.
Here it is now.
Ha ha!
  Now we are talking, aren't we?
  Oh, bloody hell.
I'm loving it.
It's not a bad ride, is it?
  It's a bit bouncy but it will add to the occasion, you know?
  Yeah.
I think we're just going to go for it.
Yeah, I think so.
Unaware of the work her groom is putting in to his rock festival idea,
Beca is wondering if this wedding will happen at all.
I'm hoping my invitation is going to come soon so that I at least know what date we are getting married.
I'm hoping the invitation isn't going to be hand made by Hywel.
Anything tacky with stick on bits and stick on paper flowers
and shiny little diamonds and things like that.
No, with this groom, it's class all the way.
I'm just sending the first batch of texts out as invitations,
so away we go.
I mean, inviting people via text to the wedding isn't formal, isn't traditional,
but I'm not formal or traditional really.
It is the quickest way. Text is best.
He's obviously not allowed to contact his bride,
so it looks like she's not going to be invited to her own wedding.
For Beca's dream Breakfast At Tiffany's wedding,
she wants formal, elegant table decorations.
  This is lovely, isn't it?
  This is really nice. Is that something you would like?
Yeah, just what I had in mind.
Seems pretty tight to me.
I like that it is just the white flowers, contrasting against the black vase.
It is great, just what I want.
It's been two weeks since Beca last saw her man.
I am really missing Hywel.
He is the love of my life and we have so much fun together,
so when he's not with me, it's just a bit too quiet.
Oh, this is heavy, for me.
'Time is really dragging.'
I'm going to bed every night and I'm thinking, thank goodness it is one more day down.
  We'll both do it this time.
  Right. Ready, steady...
Slow... Ah!
'Being married to Hywel means everything to me.
I just love him so much. I want be Mrs Ap Dafydd,
And spend the rest of my life with him and grow old with him
and just getting married is the ultimate commitment which I am willing to make.
I've had another lightbulb go off in the old head.
In the build up to the wedding my entourage and I are going
to be putting together a music video using Wonderwall.
'Wonderwall is a special song for us.
'It is a song which has defined a generation,'
and that generation is mine and Beca's, but I think of Beca as my wonderwall.
'I have always said it to her, so it is going to be good.'
So, Hal, if you go in the middle, Drew, you come on this end...
The next day, Hywel gets his friends and family together to create the video tribute to Beca.
This is my directorial debut, see how it goes.
Al, you need a guitar. Make it look like you are playing, yeah?
That's good, Al.
Are we all set?
Right, here we go.
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that light us there are blinding...
Hywel may have Liam's haircut, but he does not have his voice.
Because maybe
You're gonna...
Oh, shit!
And after all
You're my wonderwall...
Tidy.
I'm stinking!
After all his creative efforts, Hywel needs to let his hair down.
"Tequila" (Mint Royale remix) by Terrorvision
Luckily, it's time for his stag.
  Cheers!
It is a hard job trusting him and wondering what he's doing,
when I can't see him or even just, you know, a quick text or anything like that.
'I have had moments of worry this last fortnight,'
where I've been thinking, oh, my gosh, he could be doing anything.
Looks like the stag might have peaked too soon.
Hywel, Hywel, listen, it's six o'clock.
We're in Cardiff.
Tidy. You're fucking sweet as a nut.
Get away from me.
Hywel, here's a pint of water for you.
Oh! Joseph Jones!
Holding up, lads!
It's the end of the second week and Hywel's put aside Â£300 for bridesmaids' dresses.
But he hopes he doesn't have to spend it all.
To be honest, I'm not the biggest of fans of shopping in general.
So not looking forward to getting dresses today for the girls.
It's tough luck on his bridesmaids,
Rayner, and Beca's little sister, Nicole.
  I am a little bit scared because I really don't know what he's going to choose for us.
  Same.
Ladies. I've got my colour scheme sorted.
It's going to be brown or gold, right?
Right...!
  And I'm thinking, as cheap and cheerful as possible, this will be.
  Right!
(God!)
Just get a similar colour or even if you're in different colours, maybe.
  I don't know.
  Two different style dresses?
  Yeah, as long as it's the same colour, isn't it?
  Are you sure?
Yeah, whatever. It'll be fine.
Do you think it's nicer to have them in the same material,
purely because if you go for satin and taffeta, you've got two completely different contrasts?
Oh, right, now you're talking absolute gibberish to me, to be honest.
I don't know what different material's gold satin...
That's like a taffety type, so, or, like, yeah, it is.
Well listen, yeah, just do what you like, do you know what I mean?
It's massive on me, Hywel.
Yeah, but that can be taken in and that, can't it?
Well, at least brown dresses won't show the mud.
I think that dress, yeah, looked really good on both of you,
so if we can get a gold dress now that looks good on either of you...
She hasn't got any.
She got one like that in gold but it's a size 18 so it can't be altered to my size.
So there's no other gold dress that would go with that for the two of you there?
Not really.
It's not really happening, is it?
All Hywel can do is ask the shop owner to try and get him another matching dress.
  Cheers.
  OK, thank you.
Will she be able to find him one in time?
It's six days till the wedding and Hywel's choosing music for the reception.
A bit of everything, really.
You know, uplifting Britpop tunes, indie tunes, some random dance tunes
from the 80s like Boom Shaka Laka and Chaka Demus and Pliers.
Hywel shouldn't be worrying about dodgy dance tunes.
He should be worried about his outdoor wedding.
'It's time to get a look at the weather. Sue Charles is here.'
'For parts of South Wales, certainly along south east Wales, we've had some really heavy downpours.
'A band of rain has brought some pretty wet weather...'
And this is August.
The Welsh weather's definitely not playing ball.
It's a very miserable Monday.
I'm not regretting my decision to go for an outside wedding venue.
I think I wanted something special, I wanted it to be bold.
I wanted something that's spectacular and that's what we've got.
Obviously, I mean, I'd be a fool not to be slightly worried about what Beca thinks.
I mean, I'm sure the guests would prefer it if the sun was shining
or they were undercover as opposed to being in the middle of a downpour.
In terms of relying upon the Welsh weather, I have taken a massive gamble. There's no doubt about it.
Hywel's on his way to collect the centrepiece to his theme, the mini Pyramid Stage.
With no budget left, he's charmed a friend into making it for free.
Aah! I'm absolutely loving it!
  Have we got a bit of Sellotape?
  Oh, yes.
  Yeah?
Sorry, you're just going to have to wait.
  Good luck, right.
  Thank you.
He's going to need it.
If it rains, he's not even got enough money left for brollies.
Just 48 hours to go and Hywel sends best man Tom to make a delivery to Beca.
I'm going to give her an invite for the big day.
I believe it's a bit late so I've managed to acquire a few goodies to try and appease the situation.
Well, good morning, Rebecca. How are we?
Cheesegate at your services! How are we?
I'm all right. I'm nervous. What have you got for me?
  I can imagine. You should be!
  Oh, God!
I've got a few things for you.
This is an invite... This is an invite for the big day.
  Thank you.
  And then we've got some goodies here.
  Oh!
  Why look good when you can look fantastic?
  Ooh!
  Are you excited?
  Yeah. Shall we open the invitation?
  Yeah, go on, then.
This party invitation.
My lovely wedding invitation.
Well, it's classier than a text. Just.
What does it say at the bottom? "Hope you can come"!
  Is that what you had in mind?
  No!
So are you going to go?
  Yes, I suppose.
  Why not?
Got nothing else on, have I?
God alive!
Prankster Tom slipped in a little extra.
Libido booster!
Heightened sensations of pleasure and desire!
I'm worrying what he's expecting from me after he's given me this libido booster!
It's the day before the wedding, and down on the farm, Hywel's sorting out his table plan.
Lovely jubbly.
Brian?
Richard?
Absolute nightmare, this job.
Basically, got to sort all these names out for each of the tables and it's just like a jigsaw.
I wish I'd delegated it to one of the boys, if I'm honest with you.
Right pain in the proverbial.
Who's Richard?
I've seen Pam twice.
For fuck's sakes!
Rachel... I've seen Rachel about three times.
Maybe they're different Rachels?
In just 24 hours, his bride will be heading to her outdoor wedding.
RAIN POURS OUTSIDE Bloody hell! It's hammering down.
Just what I need.
I've got this rubbish job to do and then the rain is pouring.
Can't wait(!)
Shelley, Ceri.
In Swansea, it's the moment Beca's been dreading.
The bride who wanted to look like Holly Golightly is about to see her rock and roll frock.
Hiya.
  How are you feeling?
  Really nervous. I just want to see my dress.
  Yeah, so do we! Come down.
  Thank you.
Rayner and Beca's aunties, Pauline and Linda, have come to hold her hand.
How will the short dress go down with the 5'0" bride?
Oh, it's in there.
Are you OK?
Oh, God, what if it's horrible?
  It's not.
  It won't be.
  It'll be all right.
This is Hywel, mind, we're talking about.
  Oh, that's gorgeous!
  Oh, my God!
  That's so nice.
  Stunning.
  Stunning, Bec. It's beautiful.
And it looks like it's going to fit you.
That's beautiful.
  Are you ready to try it on?
  Yeah, yeah, let's get it on.
Oh, my God.
You look gorgeous.
It's a little bit big.
It'll just need to be adjusted.
You look amazing.
Doesn't she look lovely?
Does it look nice?
Gorgeous. How do you feel?
Yeah. It needs to be taken in. But I don't know, I haven't seen myself.
  I'm worried that the length is too long.
  No, it's not.
  Do you think it's too long?
  No!
Do you like it? Are you thinking it's too long for you?
Maybe. I need a tan as well, don't I?
  And it doesn't make my legs look stumpy or anything, does it?
  No.
The longer she has it on, the more the doubts creep in.
Are you sure the length is OK?
I'm just a little bit worried that it's too long for me because I'm so short.
This bow shouldn't be higher on my hip, should it?
  No, it's perfect.
  What about my hair, does it not clash with my hair?
No!
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.
Gorgeous.
  Did he choose this?
  Yes.
Isn't it cute?
Quick, get it off before she changes her mind!
  Take it off?
  Yeah.
It's the evening before the big day,
and there's one little person who has high hopes for the future.
I really missed Hywel the last few weeks.
I'm really looking forward for my mother to marry Hywel
and I'm really excited too.
It's the morning of the wedding and in this corner of south Wales it's not raining.
The bride has no idea how lucky she is.
  Cheers!
  Happy wedding day.
I was awake at about half past five and I couldn't get back to sleep then. A bit anxious.
Excited about all the surprises and seeing what he's done.
So, did the groom manage to get hold of matching bridesmaid's dresses in the end?
I've got no idea what they're going to come in wearing.
Oh, oh my gosh.
I so wasn't expecting that!
Really traditional.
They're not an exact match.
  And you've got a different colour.
  Sash.
That's lovely.
Yeah, I can see why he went for the different coloured sash
for Rayner because then that picks her out as the maid of honour.
He's just thought of everything. He's done really well.
Hmm... More by accident than design!
Just let me have a look at the flower.
Do you think it matches the brown or is it...?
Not completely, no.
There's more mud brown heading her way in the shape of dad Clive and son Alex's suits.
Oh, you look lovely!
Oh, you look so lovely, come here.
You look like Oliver Twist!
Aww! You look lovely.
And you too, Dad!
  Sorry.
  You're not bad yourself!
Oh, babe, you look so...
Watch my make up!
Sit down there and don't move. Don't crease anything.
Over at a local B&B, Hywel's decided against the yellow trainers after all. Phew!
He's continued his brown colour scheme right through to his face.
Tom Jones, eat your heart out, with a tan.
Put shades on now as well.
  We are rocking.
  We are rocking. We will!
Quality. Let's go.
Yeah. I'll just get my shoes on now and I'll feel better, because I'm taller.
Hold your dress up for me.
Perfect.
Fab.
  Are you sure I look all right?
  You look amazing.
Got you just a little present.
  Something for you to wear.
  Aww, thank you!
Oh, a garter!
  It's your something blue.
  Oh, it's lovely.
Something for him to take off with his teeth!
You ready now?
Yes. Come on, let's do it.
Oh! It's a camper van!
How do we get in there?
That's real cool, isn't it? Come on.
Where are we going?
The suspense is killing me.
How are we, right, enjoy the hen do?
At the ornamental gardens, the weather's still holding up.
It's looking pretty good. I wouldn't have fancied it if it was raining, mind.
Luckily enough, it's turned out nice for them.
I think God's looking down on Hywel and his decision to go outside.
It would have been terrible if it was raining, but no, it's lovely.
I just don't know where we're going.
We're just driving aimlessly around South Wales!
Welcome to Dyffryn.
Dyffryn Gardens...
  This is nice, isn't it?
  Lovely place.
Oh, wow.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Well done.
I've never been here before but it's really lovely,
and what I've seen so far, the grounds are stunning.
It's really nice. So I'm just eager now to see what's through there!
"Wonderwall" by Oasis
It's a bit tight here, isn't it?
Yeah.
How are you so brown?
  Have you been on the beds?
  I've been working outside, haven't I?
  Those of you that have seats, please be seated.
Shaking.
If I could ask you just to step forward.
Hywel, do you willingly commit yourself in marriage to Beca?
  I do.
  Thank you.
Rebecca, do you willingly commit yourself in marriage to Hywel?
  I do.
  Thank you.
  I, Hywel John Ap Dafydd...
  I, Hywel John Ap Dafydd...
  ..take thee, Rebecca Jane Dawkins...
  ..take thee, Rebecca Jane Dawkins...
  ..to be my wedded wife.
  ..to be my wedded wife.
I promise to cherish and care for you, to live with you in love and harmony.
I give you this ring as a symbol of my endless love for you.
  All that I am...
  All that I am...
  ..and all that I have...
  ..and all that I have...
  ..I bring to you.
  ..I bring to you.
(Thank you.)
  May this ring...
  May this ring...
  Remind us of this moment...
  Remind us of this moment...
..And the commitment I have made to you.
..And the commitment I have made to you.
It gives me the greatest of pleasure to tell you that you're now husband and wife.
If you wish, you can kiss your bride.
I think it's amazing. Amazing so far.
You've just done everything spot on. Thank you.
  The best it can be.
  Is it? Aww!
So far, so good.
But what's she going to make of the farm marquee?
Just over there, I think.
  You see the dirt track?
  Where are you taking us?
  What is it?
  What is it?
  It's quite clearly a farm.
  A farm.
No!
Come and have a look, babe.
Oh!
Welcome to our wedding.
It's brilliant! Look at the flowers!
Hywel's ditched the wellies in favour of vases.
Look at the table decorations.
The album covers!
I can't stop smiling.
The cake as well. Come and have a closer look.
I can see it's a camper van!
Oh! That's brilliant!
Oh, my God!
Have a look. Some lovely photographs of you and me from Glastonbury.
  Oh, my God!
Look at that cracker!
My boring shorts, and you in that lovely mac!
Hywel!
Oh, that's funny.
I've brought Glastonbury to South Wales, babe, what do you think?
It's brilliant. I love it so much...
I'm speechless. Thank you, babe.
  You're welcome.
  And I love you.
I love you, too.
  I love you.
  Don't cry!
Let's go outside and enjoy the view.
Please make your way to the tables now.
Make your way to the tables, thank you.
I think some people are really surprised
with Hywel's organisational skills and the fact he's actually pulled off this whole event within three weeks.
It's quite an achievement really.
He's obviously worked his butt off,
and he's just thought of absolutely everything that he can think of
and he has, he's pulled it off really well.
Hywel has definitely brought Glastonbury to South Wales in miniature form.
Everything is absolutely brilliant.
I think the only things missing are the portable toilets!
Hywel's got one last surprise for his festival bride.
To my beautiful wife.
Beca, my best friend and my partner, my soul mate,
my love, my life and now you're my wife.
But most of all, you're my wonderwall.
  Aww!
So this is from me with love to you, Bec.
It's awesome, Alex!
Today is going to be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should have somehow realised that you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
  I said maybe
  I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
Saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
  Saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
Saves me...
I think he's done a really good job,
and he's gone to a lot of trouble to do it.
I'm really, really glad that he's in my family now,
and I'm sure he's going to do a really good job of being a stepfather.
Today has just been amazing, in one word.
The weather. The people.
All Hywel's choices.
The dress, the venue, everything has just been perfect.
He's pulled it off. You have pulled it off.
Thank you, Hywel. It's been amazing.
It's been just perfect. I couldn't have asked for anything more.
I couldn't have done it better myself. So thank you.
  And I love you.
  I love you, too.
