In the Midlands: the lorry drivers with loads on their minds.
The yew is planning height restrictions on HTVs. And what is
the connection between a Worcestershire chip shop, a German
hot dog seller and a European Court Hello from the Midlands. As our MPs
prepare for the crucial vote on the European referendum, we also have
Europe on our minds. We will have the answer do the link between the
German hot dog seller and a Worcestershire fish and chip shop.
Midlands road hauliers are in a tailspin over plans to restrict the
height of many of their HGVs the commission says it would make it
easier to move goods around Europe if lorries were no taller than four
metres. To help us get the measure of this, here with me today,
Malcolm Harbour, one of our Conservative MEPs for the West
Midlands. Ms Reynolds, the Labour MP for Wolverhampton North East and
newly appointed as the shadow Europe Minister, and might mattress
   Mike Nattrass, UKIP's MEP for the West Midlands.
Our transport correspondent has been talking to truckers.
Love them or hate them, HGVs are a common sight. Even with greater use
of the railways, the majority of the things we make or buy still go
haulage firms up sympathising with bigger lorries, fewer journeys and
less pollution.    soubrette sizing. Some fans like Birmingham based
Palletline claim that the EU proposals could see the brakes
being applied when it comes to going green. It is bureaucracy gone
mad. Clearly someone has not thought this through. They are not
aware of the problems back European hauliers face and particularly
British hauliers face. The EU is considering proposals to restrict
the height of lorry trailers to four metres like this one. The
reason according to officials is that it will make it easier to move
goods around or 27 EU countries.    or 27. Some countries have low
bridges on major routes. Rather than rebuild them, the EU appears
to want to change the height of lorries, regardless of where they
operate. For the UK, that is a big problem was that according to
government figures, 80% of the lorry fleet is over four metres.
What it would mean for Palletline as an organisation and other
British hauliers is that potentially they would have to run
more vehicles, by more vehicles, employ more drivers and there would
be twice the number of vehicles on the road. This is what he is
talking about. The trailer being unloaded is well over four metres
and the goods are being transferred to a trailer that meets the EU's
proposals. As you can see, it does not fit so you need a second lorry.
Other companies have    are just as concerned. This is the John Lewis
Warehouse in Redditch. Online orders are dispatched from here all
over the UK. Much of its fleet consists of double decker lorries.
Here at least there is some good news. The euro appears to have done
a last minute U turn meaning that regardless of height, they can
still run. They form a major part of our environmental strategy. They
reduce our carbon dioxide by 25%. They are Keith in that ensuring our
environmental impact of our transport fleet is minimised   
they are key in ensuring. Under the current proposals, this 4.9 double 
deck trailer would be allowed on the roads. But this 4.6 metre
single deck trailer would not. Nat Copsey is an expert on all
things Europe and despite the confusion, he maintains that it
makes sense to harmonise. Harmonisation is what allows the
single market to function proper to    properly. The single market is
our largest trading partner. We have to have the same rules and
regulations in place across the 27 EU member states otherwise it will
not work. The government is not impressed. A statement from the
Department of Transport says, we share the concerns of the UK
haulage industry about the European Commission's proposals. It adds
that it will press the Commission to maintain the existing right of
member states to set the permitted height of lorries.
Already, several haulage firms have gone out of business because of the
recession. There is our best that any new EU rules could see even
more going the same way    there is now the rest.
Confused? Me too. I can see that Mike Nattrass is itching to get on
it. I will come first to the two of you who want Britain to stay in the
European Union forever, as far as we can see. Isn't this exactly the
sort of issue that makes Europe such a hard sell? It does look like
it is making regulation a fetish. Part of the problem is that your
report, I'm afraid, is very misleading. First of all, we are
aware of the problem. I have been working on it for months. The
commission is very much aware of the problems. What is the problem?
First of all, what your report did not say is that 22 out of 27
countries already do not allow trucks of more than four metres to
go on their roads. That is there now. That will continue. If the
issue is that member states, including Britain, can allow larger
trucks to operate. We have already had the double Decker trailers
which are significantly higher and there is no question but a dark and
I would be astonished if the commission also did not make a
concession for the normal trailers. They are also very good green
reasons. If you look on the roads, streamlined the trailers are saving
CO2. I think you have not actually reported the facts. Why is it that
so many including some in your constituency are so anxious about
it? First day, let me say, I am a pro European, I believe in the
benefits of our membership of the European Union and I believe in the
benefits of the biggest single market in the world. His commission
proposals are not to get final. Because we have a strong voice in
Europe, we are able to influence these. That is very important. I do
not think that the commission should, when it comes to the
European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, I do not think they
should decide to restrict the height of our hauliers. I think
that will be what happens in the end. Mike Nattrass. 80% of the
trailer fleet would be out of order on this regulation if imposed. A I
think it should be the result of our government and what they need
to tell us and our roads are capable of taking traffic and very
little to do with Europe. If these traders have to go into Europe,
obviously they have to abide by the rules of any of the individual
countries. But we should not be told to restrict the height of our
vehicles because it is a green issues. You are saying the result
would be more lorries, each of them a bit smaller and therefore more
traffic was sacked more Denny's, lorries.    more journeys. The
distinction between using the trucks on the road and the
technical regulations... If you make trailers, all the braking
systems and construction is common so you can make a 40 ft trailer
anywhere in Europe and get it approved locally and it can run
anywhere. That is an important part of the single market if you are
manufacturer in trailers. Also, other countries have the same
issues as we do. In Sweden, they run bigger trucks because they have
longer open highways. This is perfectly normal and there is no
reason at all why we cannot get the permission to set it up and frankly
we have been working on it for a long time. It does seem to be a
more prescription for more lorries, more congestion. I think we can win
the argument on this one. It is not clear that these are the final
Commission proposals. I feel it is a bit dramatic to say that these
are already the proposals and these are going to have this kind of
implication when we do not even know what the commission are going
to propose. Nat Copsey says that you should not see the issue in
isolation, it is part of a broader harmonisation to make the single
market work. It is none of their business. They should not be
discussing the height of trailers within the UK. But they have to run
across Europe. Our trailers can change. We do not have to run those
trailers into Europe. The single market, we are looking to make
things easier for manufacturers and also for exporters. But that does
not mean to say that we have to apply every single role within our
own roads. We have in some cases different speed limits, for example.
The government is putting up speed limits on motorways where different
speed limits... We have different road signs, we have different
alcohol limits, different driving licence regulations. This is the
same thing. If Labour from a government, we do not have you have
moved on to something less double  ended did tell than this? I do not.
There is an important issue. In some cases it, it is very important
to have an effective single market and that they are roars across the
27 member states. In other cases, it is not important for that to
happen and it is no better handled at a member state level. This is a
case in point. I do not think that this will be hopefully the
commission's final proposals. I am worried that we are worrying about
this too early. You can choose any product that you like. You can
choose manhole covers and you can find that the French hold    friend
specification is being used of manhole covers which is putting
business that in why is it that every time I want to speak, Malcolm
Harbour is coming in. I never speak when you are speaking. There is
plenty of mileage left in this but at this point, we have to go. Thank
you. At last, the answer to the puzzle linking a Worcestershire
fish and chip shop with a German hot dog seller who took a test case
to the European Court of Justice. The result was that VAT had to be
cut on hot takeaway food throughout the land of the Frankfurter and the
hamburger. Now the Worcestershire chip shop is hoping to emulate his
German counterpart because VAT was after all originally introduced as
a European harmonisation tax. Ben Sidwell reports now from Hannover
and Hagley. Fish and chips, they are about as British as you can get.
Our place    Our Plaice is one of the best trip and fish shops in the
country. Now they have their sights set on Europe. Cod and chips please.
There are over 10,000 fish and chip shops in the UK but you may not be
aware that every what time you buy it food from one you are paying VAT
on it. That could all be about to change banks do a sausage seller
He in at Hannover, like the rest of Germany, the sausage is big
business. It is one of the most popular takeaway foods. So when one
sausage seller decided to challenge the government over tax laws, it
became very big news. The sausage seller who goes by the name of
Manfred Bog claimed that he supplied simple easily prepared
food. And unlike a restaurant, did not offer any service. Therefore he
should not pay VAT, he said. On Mars 10th this year, the European
Court of Justice found in favour of Manfred Bog and three other similar
cases. It was a ruling that could Here in England, our sausages are
much bigger. But this is not a row about size. It is all about money.
Wrong altogether. No food should have VAT on it. All countries
should be treated the same way. really is unfair. We want a level
playing field for our members. May, Gregg Howard was elected as
President of National Federation of Fish Friers, representing every
fish and chip shop in the country. They have now appointed a by   
advisers to fight to the VAT battle. It is a matter for the courts.
There are some complex legal arguments in play here and it is
for the courts to decide. I think it is better than a 5050 chance
that some of these principles and indeed other principles should
apply to the UK zero rate. As we are all part of the European Union,
does it follow that rules in place in Germany should be applied it to
the UK? The tax man here does not think so. Her Majesty's Revenue and
Customs say, the European Court of Justice judgment has no
implications for the United Kingdom. It should be across the board. If
it is good enough for Hannover, it is good enough of Hagley. It should
be exactly the same across Europe. We are all Europeans. If the fish
and chip shop industry win their case, other takeaways and could
soon follow. Whether that means cheaper food for us, that remains
to be seen. That is one that sausage and chips and one of fish
and chips. Do you want to VAT on those?
That really is a question, isn't it! Ben Sidwell has found his true
calling on life. Mike Nattrass, a clear example where most people
would see tax harmonisation as a good thing. In Yorkshire, the best
fish and chips you can buy, in Whitby. UKIP are supporting tax
harmonisation? Certainly not. VAT is a European tax. We regret I have
to speak about harmonisation in Parliament. There is a prospect of
harmonisation of VAT across Europe. That is heavily guarded against by
a number of member states including the UK. We believe that we should
have control of our own taxation. I strongly believe that we should do
that. But if you try to reduce VAT, the European Commission get excited
because they are going to cut. So, if for example the Labour
government want to zero rate fuel, gas or electricity, they cannot.
Malcolm Harbour, you were shaking your head through much of that.
What is your concern? First of all, VAT is a comment type of taxation
that we have agreed to. Member states, have different rates.
have a zero rate and Germany has a 5%. The show hearers    Series... I
think it is most unlikely that it will change in Germany. That is
certainly the impression they have in Germany. I do not think so. They
must have read the judgment. It came up from the lower courts
because Manfred Bog said in a VAT plane which said that this is food
and where people eat at my school, I charge VAT, which is something
that goes on with cold food here. It has been referred back to the
court to make a judgment. The judgment does not actually support
his case. The whole issue is what is food and what is a service. If
you look in the UK rules on VAT, they are very clear. If you heard
hot food, heating is delivering a service. Before week loom on to the
other issues, what do you think Emma Reynolds? I can see that the
fish fryers are looking at the German hot dog sellers and thinking,
if they have managed to win it, if they do managed to win it, is in
not quite similar, serving a sausage in a square in Germany and
providing fish and chips in a chip shop in Hagley? This is much more
of a product than a service. I can see where they are coming from. We
do not have total harmonisation of VAT. We have got to bear that in
mind. Quick word about the referendum vote which is looming.
Mike Nattrass, yew and the Independent MEP are the driving
forces between the British and. delivered it to Number 10 a month
ago and it is now going to be debated. We got 14 MPs saying at
that time that they would speak to it when it got behind the chair.
Now it has caused a lot of problems. Reopening all of the traditional
divisions within the Tory party. The European nightmares under way
again. I do not think that is true at all. David Cameron is right to
say that why should we have a referendum now? They are big issues
to be sorted out and there are three questions on the ballot paper,
including the idea of having a change relationship based on trade
and corporations. Nobody knows what that means. I do not believe we
should go forward without a referendum without a policy behind
it. If it is a diversion. We have big problems to sort out now and
big opportunities within the European market to help growth and
recovery and we should be focusing on that. And a Reynolds, to pursue
at the German theatre    theme. I am sure you feel an element of
schadenfreude. You have rebels on Labour's benches as well. You are
not exactly united on this one either. The vast majority of our
parliamentary party Labour MPs will vote against the question of a
referendum tomorrow. The truth is that David Cameron, when he was in
opposition, he should have been saying what he is now saying in
government that our membership of the European Union is in our
national interest. If he had not been quite so opportunistic,
calling his MEPs out of the centre  right grouping in the European
Parliament, perhaps he would not be facing he is tomorrow. I agree.
agree says Mike Nattrass. We will end there. We are going to have to
leave it. A fascinating moment in politics. Thank you all very much
for being with us. That is about it from us here in
