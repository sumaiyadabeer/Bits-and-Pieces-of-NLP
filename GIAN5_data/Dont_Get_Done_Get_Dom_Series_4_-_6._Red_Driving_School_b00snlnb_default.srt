I've been fighting companies on behalf of you for years, and have won thousands in compensation.
But I don't want these people paying their way out of trouble.
I want to stop these nightmares for ever.
'Today, I drive home a strong message to a driving college
'on behalf of 11 unhappy customers.'
"Don't be defensive with me. I will get there in the end!"
'And do as Dom does   learn from my top tips
Don't be afraid of the small claims court. I've been there.
I won and it was quite a good experience.
Plus, I hit the high street to see what you know about consumer rights.
If you do your weekly shop online
and your goods don't match what you ordered, you should get a refund.
'We all want to know our future's secure in the current climate.
'A job for life is rare,
'but one company claims to offer an easy route to a lucrative career.
'RED Instructor Training say anyone with a clean licence
'can join their team of instructors and earn up to £30,000 a year.
'Sounds like a dream job to me.'
I've heard from a few people who were sold that dream  
to become a driving instructor, be your own boss, work your own hours.
They seemed to be left with a career that was permanently stalled.
  What's happened? Excuse me.
'RED Instructor Training teach you how to teach other people to drive.
'In other words, you qualify as a driving instructor.
'It will cost you just over £4,000, but RED don't make you pay up front.
'With their interest free plan,
'they say you'll be earning before you pay a penny.
'whose dreams have turned into a nightmare.'
Finance wise, it puts you in a very, VERY difficult position.
Until you're in the situation, you don't realise how stressful it is.
'Meet Mark Thornton.
'Mark is a school business manager and father of three.
'In 2009, he was facing redundancy
'so, with advance warning, decided to plan ahead.'
I looked at the skills I had, what I wanted to do.
I see an advert come up for RED on the telly
which, basically, offered a nice salary, flexibility,
and seemed to tick all the boxes I wanted for a future career.
'Mark thought becoming a RED driving instructor would suit him.
'He attended an induction session
'where a salesman explained the benefits of the instructor course.'
He explained the difficulties of the actual course,
that it wasn't a straightforward course,
but explained the flexibility of training,
what the programme of training was.
It just ticked all the boxes.
It just seemed right, something that I'd been interested in.
'It all sounded perfect so Mark signed up.
'RED also said they could make it easy to pay for the training.'
The finance agreement sounded attractive
because it was "buy now, pay later".
The promise he made me was I would be earning money within 16 weeks.
'First stage was passing the theory test, which Mark did.'
The next stage was 20 hours being taught how to drive properly again.
'But booking the training sessions was difficult.
'It seemed oversubscribed.'
The gap between training sessions was too long.
I think the instructor, when he was teaching us,
was seeing so many people he couldn't relate to me at my next lesson.
He couldn't remember exactly what I had done  
my failures, my successes.
It was very difficult, a very frustrating period.
'Eventually, Mark passed this stage.
'The final part was learning how to teach  
'an important bit, but this is where the problems got really bad.'
What I'd been told by my instructor
is that I would automatically get on to my part three training within two weeks completion of the test.
I contacted RED, I think it was October time,
and RED told me that they were unable
to book any part three training for me until December.
I was pretty upset. It's a long time.
Don't know what happened to the two weeks promise.
At that point, I was keen and wanted to get on and go through training.
I received a phone call back about mid November
telling me that they couldn't provide training in December.
They made a mistake and didn't have any instructors available.
Actually, they couldn't start my part three training until early January.
'Facing unemployment, this was not something he could afford.
'The sales pitch led him to believe he could be earning within months.
'Mark took things into his own hands and booked onto a rival course
'and is close to qualifying.
'With 12 months grace with RED about to end,
'he faces a debt of £7,800 for a course he has not yet finished.
'And he forked out a further £1,200 for his training at another school.
'Unsurprisingly, he wants his agreement with RED cancelled.'
The one thing that really upset me over the whole process
was that being in the redundancy scenario, clock ticking,
being told that I could complete this package in a short period of time,
be earning money
and lessening the impact on my family and the way we live,
and then that not being there, that was the disappointing thing.
To go from 16 weeks to nearly a year
just wasn't acceptable.
And, you know, finance wise, it puts you in a very, VERY difficult position.
'Mark deserves some answers.'
I've contacted Dom, and what I would really love
is for Dom to fight my case for me, fight my corner.
'I've asked him to meet me, to find out more.'
  Do you feel you've been missold something?
  Definitely.
When I went to the induction session,
they've not delivered on anything we were told.
I've seen the adverts. They look very glossy.
  And it does promise you this change of life, doesn't it?
  Yeah.
I was looking for a job where I had flexibility.
I was hoping to be teaching by now.
I'm unemployed with the loan about to kick in.
  In a nutshell, you are skint?
  Yes.
  How skint?
  Very.
This could... I could lose my home.
  As a result of what you've taken out with RED?
  Yes.
  It's serious.
  Very.
  One of the promises when I went for the induction was we would be earning money within 16 weeks.
  Right.
  In theory, you were never going to be in trouble financially.
  No.
You take out this loan, you get your training, you become an instructor,
  you start earning, then you start paying back the loan.
  Yeah.
  Why did it go wrong?
  One thing they promised us was the 20 hour training
we could do it to suit ourselves in our own time,
that it also possible to do it all in one week.
By the sounds of it, they haven't got enough instructors behind them,
to fulfil what they're promising.
I would say that was a fair summary.
'It's likely that the salesman didn't say "I promise",
'but Mark thought that he'd be earning money before his one year credit agreement ran out.'
What do you think RED should do?
I think RED need to look at their level of support they can offer people.
Stop over selling if they don't have the mechanisms to provide a service.
I think they need to generally look at their entire approach
to how they're selling training courses.
What would you like out of this situation?
It might not be an easy battle.
From my perspective, I'd like to wash my hands of RED.
Obviously, I wouldn't want the loan.
I don't think I've been given the service that I signed up for.
I'd like to see RED address their issues and stop others getting into this situation.
'Mark isn't the only one with problems.
'I've also been contacted by Rob Tucker,
'also desperate to cancel his agreement with RED.
'Rob used to be a coach driver but, since becoming a grandfather,
'was looking for a way to spend more time with his family.'
I've always wanted to be a driving instructor,
having driven for a living.
'After a lifetime of working behind the wheel,
'Rob should have been the perfect candidate to teach people how to drive.'
I went to Bristol and saw a young lady who took me out in a car,
said I was suitable because I could talk and drive at the same time.
'There was a fee of £4,216, but RED helped Rob get the finance.
'After all, the first 12 months were interest free.
'Paying it should have been a piece of cake once he started earning.
'Then the unthinkable happened.'
Six days before I was due to start, I had my first heart attack.
'Surely, RED would understand and cancel his agreement.'
I rang RED and told them that I'd suffered a heart attack
and I wouldn't be available for the course in five days' time.
I was told it was very inconvenient. I should give them ten days' notice.
I wish I could have given them ten days' notice.
'RED said they expected Rob to take the course when he was ready.'
"As long as you've got a licence we'll keep the course open."
'Then Rob had a second heart attack. Surely RED would be sympathetic.'
Standard letter came back. "As long as you've got a licence, we'll keep the course open."
'RED were not offering a refund, and said they'd keep the course open.
'Rob's interest free year is over, which means he owes £7,804
'payable over the next four years, and the first payments are overdue.'
Until you're in the situation, you don't realise how stressful it is.
'If he did complete the course,
'Rob fears his health would not only affect him.'
I find I'm not so easy going
and the stress would be too much to take.
Hopefully, when I meet Dom, he's going to put my mind at ease.
He'll be able to talk to someone at RED and hopefully get a result.
I hope I'm not his first where he doesn't.
'This needs to be sorted out.
'I believe in strength in numbers, so I asked Rob to meet me and Mark
'to see what I can do to help them both.'
  Rob, Mark. Mark, Rob.
  Hello, Rob.
I'm going to take the case on, but I'm not doing it on my own.
I need some help. There's a couple of things here.
The big problem here in your case, Rob,
medical issues are why you couldn't fulfil your side of the deal.
You've had heart attacks and major heart surgery.
You told me a doctor has told you that he does not recommend that you instruct people for a living.
  That's correct.
  I want you to get that in writing.
What I'd like you both to do is to do some research.
Do you think that you are fairly isolated,
or is there a bigger picture?
I think, personally, there's a massive picture out there.
If you go on to various websites,
there are hundreds of guys in the same position as ourselves.
  All complaining about RED?
  All complaining about RED.
Try and get details relative to complaints, and get me a list.
I'm going to start making phone calls to RED and keep you informed.
Let's unite.
  It's solidarity   us lot trying to sort out a problem with RED.
  Lovely.
Might is right. The more we get the stronger we're going to be.
I don't FEEL he'll get it sorted. I KNOW he's going to get it sorted.
He'll succeed where I failed for eight months.
I'm disappointed that there seems to be a lot of people
complaining about the same company.
Are they making promises they can't keep? That's pretty bad.
The fact there's lots of people complaining is going to help me.
The more complaints I've got,
the more right I've got to try and make them sort out their problems.
I'm actually quite looking forward to getting started.
Let's see how I get on, eh?
'With Rob and Mark receiving the runaround, I'll have my work cut out.
'If more people have been let down by RED,
'I want to know about them and I want to know why.
'Coming up, the case against RED grows from two to 11 complaints.'
No job's worth that.
And it certainly hasn't been worth it, at all.
'We've asked you what rights you think you have as a consumer.
'It's time to find out if you know your onions.'
Sometimes, big companies think they can treat us like dummies.
There's no point getting hot under the collar unless you've got your facts straight.
My research team are finding out how much you know about consumer rights.
The results are pretty juicy.
'Let's see what these guys think is true.'
If you see some furniture in Spain and you buy it,
and when you get home it's nothing like it's meant to be,
if it's a department store, they would have records.
I guess, if you have a receipt with codes and numbers, you must be able to get your money back.
Under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations,
you have the same level of cover across the whole of the EU.
Complain to the retailer, and if you don't get anywhere, your credit card company should be able to intervene.
If you bought that table in China,
I'm not sure because they're not in Europe.
It might be a different policy.
If your purchase was made outside of the EU,
it's a much stickier situation because EU law doesn't apply.
The law of the country you made the purchase in applies.
Your only chance is to complain to your credit card company.
Oh. I did not know that.
If you do your weekly shop online
and your goods don't match what you ordered you should get a refund.
The Distance Selling Regulation covers you when you buy on the internet.
Sadly, it won't cover food, drink, accommodation, travel,
concert tickets or financial services.
But supermarkets are fairly good and you should get a refund.
I'm staggered. I didn't know that.
'Trust me, it's worth being sure.
'Brush up on your consumer knowledge and you won't get done.'
'I'm on the case of RED Driving School  
'a driver instructor college that sold two men a dream career
'that has become a nightmare.
'Many schools offer instructor training, but they chose RED.
'The company made it easy to join, but what exactly do you get?
'In effect, you're buying a franchise  
'you own part of the RED business for a fee of £4,216.
'They organise credit, so there's no money up front.
'With 12 months interest free,
'you'll be earning before repayments kick in.
'You can't earn until you complete training, and for Mark and Rob, this is where the trouble began.'
I have to do two lots of research for Mark and for Robert.
I have got enough basic information to get the ball rolling
so, first port of call will be to contact RED Driving School.
'I want to give RED a chance to explain what's gone wrong.
'Both Mark and Rob feel their complaints have fallen on deaf ears
'but maybe I'll have more luck.'
..from the BBC. Hello, there...
'I get through to customer services.
'There isn't much to report as I encounter roadblocks straight away.'
..details of the head office... e mail address...phone number...?
'She won't discuss the case or tell me who I need to speak to
'or how I can get in touch.'
..I would expect you, minimum, to give me a phone number or contact.
It looks like you're putting up barriers...
'My persistence pays off and I get a number for head office.
'I'll have to wait to call, as they've gone home.'
Bye.
I was a little bit firm, there.
All of a sudden things changed.
"Don't be defensive with me. I will get there, one way or the other!"
'While I haven't got far with RED yet, this case is progressing,
'but not in a positive direction.
'Mark and Rob aren't the only ones whose careers have stalled.
'I asked them to find others with complaints against RED.
'A quick look in my e mail box revealed another load of complaints.
'And they keep coming in.'
11 people have written complaining about RED in one way or another.
Some of them have similar problems, some haven't.
I've represented them with these model cars.
The blues, these two, are people who have health problems
and don't believe they should do the course.
The black ones, those four there,
are people who have complained about the finance in one way or another.
And these five here   Chevrolet Camaro, I like that  
these people are complaining because they are unable to take the course.
Normally, because there's not enough instructors. It's not looking good.
'RED are part of the UK's largest trainer of driving instructors.
'They say they didn't become the biggest without striving to be best.
'They boast pass rates 50% above the national average.
'That's no consolation for these customers.
'Two more wannabe instructors are Eileen Cooper and James Goddard.
'They both took out a credit agreement.'
The credit agreement to pay for the course was just shy of £4,000,
which I was told I could pay off when I started training.
'As with Mark, RED have failed to provide enough training sessions
'to qualify before the interest free period expires.'
Eventually, I passed my theory test
on the... I believe it was 6th June.
And the first lesson that I could get in Darlington
was for 16th July.
'All RED could offer was one lesson in six weeks' time.
'At that rate, it would take two years to qualify.
'They have reached the end of the interest free period.'
No job's worth that. No job.
And it certainly hasn't been worth it, at all.
'So, how easy is it to qualify as an instructor?
'Let's start with what RED would have us believe.'
These are tough times. It's not all bad news.
There's a company that's growing and you can be part of it.
Become a driving instructor with RED.
There's never any shortage of people who want to learn to drive.
You could be teaching them. You could earn up to £30,000 a year.
Start training now with RED, the UK's leading driving instructor training network.
Before you know it, you'll be able to choose your own working hours.
You're guaranteed a place in a RED driving school,
one of the fastest growing driving schools in the UK.
That all makes it sound so easy
but I've got a funny feeling that's not quite the case.
'No wonder so many people have bought into RED's sales pitch.
'Does the reality really stack up?
'We tracked down driving instructors keen to dish out a dose of reality.'
The training took me about a year,
probably about as quick as you can do it.
It took one year to train to become a driving instructor.
As a self employed instructor, earnings can go up and down.
Once you take into account pupils that are sick and bad weather,
then earnings can fluctuate quite a lot.
To say that you can earn £30,000 as soon as you qualify is rubbish.
Earning can be high and also it can be nil, depends on the situation.
My warning for anyone considering this job is the fact
that there's only so many people turning 17 and wanting lessons, so you really have to be good.
It's very seasonal. You're not likely to get new pupils past November till the end of January.
Think carefully, because it's very stressful
and the money's not as great as what can be advertised on TV.
'Sounds like RED's description of life as a driving instructor
'doesn't match up to the experience of those guys.
'I have 11 people so far who have had bad experiences with RED.
'While 11 cases might mean 11 times the work for me,
'it's worse news for RED.'
It belittles what we do as professional instructors.
'Back in Gloucester, Rob's become my investigator.
'After two heart attacks, RED are refusing to cancel his course.
'They say anyone who has a licence is fit to teach.
'Clearly, RED need a little more convincing,
'so I've asked Rob to get written proof of his condition.'
I want a letter from my doctor
about becoming a driving instructor.
I had a couple of heart attacks...
'That should give me pretty strong ammunition to fire off to RED.
'As I haven't investigated the other cases yet, I've asked them to compile timelines of their lessons.
'Although Elaine passed her theory test,
'she has only had five practical lessons in almost two years.
'After over a year, James has had no practical lessons and has had to take another job.
'Mark is one exam away from qualifying,
'but he only got there by paying for lessons at another driving school.
'Rob, Mark and the other claimants have passed their evidence to me.
'I've passed it all on to RED and I've also agreed
'to pass over all other complaints I've received.'
RED Driving School. They're in for a bit of a shock.
I've got a list of 11 people so far complaining about them.
Just the ones that have come to me, not all the ones in the country.
'Since my first contact with RED, I've been back and forth via e mail
'but haven't got anyone on the phone.
'I now have the name and number of their press officer, Laura.
'Once again, I hit a roadblock.'
Do you know how long she's going to be...?
'But I've got a secret weapon.'
I can't get hold of her but I have her mobile. Let's ring the mobile!
Getting people's mobile numbers. Best thing you can do.
Very hard to escape from you.
Laura, good afternoon. It's Dominic Littlewood from the BBC...
'Bingo! The lady herself.
'She doesn't want us using her voice.
'I'll make sure you're kept up to speed. I hand over all 11 cases.'
..I've got 11 in total. We're going to draw the line at 11.
We're not going to hound you for every person out there...
'11 should keep Laura busy enough.
'Handing over the names takes some time.'
..Enrolment, S for Sierra, 3 8...
'The majority haven't been able to get enough lessons with RED
'and I want to know why.'
..I'd like somebody to talk me through the RED sales process.
Particularly, how quickly can people qualify...?
'Although she didn't have answers,
'Laura promises to look into all 11 cases. Hopefully, she'll see things from my point of view.'
Now, I was dealing with a lady there.
I said, "Look, these people have all got issues.
"Tell me what you're going to do to resolve the situation."
Put the ball in their court. If it's good, I have an easy day.
If not, I go to work and get them a better deal.
The fact is, it's all started to happen.
I like this bit of the programme.
No one knows how it's going to go from here.
'Surely, those numbers will kick start RED into action.
'Why are there so many unhappy customers?
'RED claim it's easy to pass
'and then you'll have flexible hours, an abundance of learners
'and an income of up to £30,000.
'Is this a true reflection of the reality?
'Time to get some expert advice.
'Where better than the UK Driving Instructors Association?
'I want to know what they think about RED and other companies?'
How long have you been a driving instructor?
I started around 1993, so best part of 20 years.
  You know your onions?
  Yeah.
  To say the least!
  Yeah.
  What percentage of people apply to be a driving instructor and qualify?
  It's not easy.
It's a very disappointing amount.
When I last looked, it's just under 30%.
  That's not good.
  It's not good.
'It's not necessarily all doom and gloom.
'If you are one who passes, you'll be in the money?'
You're smiling. Have you got something to say?
One of the things that people are not always trained in as a driving instructor are business skills.
If you're a good businessman, you could make a decent living.
For the vast majority, I doubt they'll earn anywhere near 30,000 within the first couple of years.
'You're not raking in the big bucks, but you'll be your own boss.'
The other thing people say is "work the hours you like".
You work the hours that people are about.
Not many people are about between eight and two during the daytime.
If you want to work evenings and weekends, you'll earn decent money.
If you've got a family, how much is seeing the family worth to you?
You'll never see your family.
  People need to do the maths before they go into it.
  Thanks, Steve.
That was interesting. It's a lot harder to get qualified than what you think.
It's hard to earn a decent wage and you'll be working all hours under the sun.
I don't think that's what the adverts portray.
'Based on DIA facts and figures,
'I've made a commercial of my own.'
These are tough times, but it's not all bad news.
There's a company that's growing and you can be part of it.
If you've got a few grand in the bank or don't mind a credit agreement with an APR of 29.8%
and don't mind paying anything up to £7,650 in just four years...
Become a driving instructor with RED.
There's never any shortage of people who want to learn to drive
and you could teach them.
There are 38,000 active driving instructors in the UK
so make sure there aren't many in your area to compete against.
You could earn up to £30,000 a year.
Working up to 60 hours per week and having one week's holiday per year.
Before you know it, you'll be your own boss and choose your own hours.
Your own hours? Not exactly.
You'll have to fit in to your students' hours   evenings, weekends and odd times of the day.
You're guaranteed a place at RED. Instructors are always in demand.
Couldn't be easier, right? Hm. Wrong!
'All my cases bought into the dream RED seem to be offering.
'I've taken time to go over all 11 cases, as have RED.
'Four complained about the finance agreement.
'They have signed and it's legal, so there's nothing I can do.
'Read the small print before you sign anything!
'The other seven, I'm fully prepared to fight.
'I just hope RED are ready to take note.'
'I love taking your problems and getting results.
'Too many of you are parting with your hard earned cash too easily.
'My inbox fills daily and the phone never stops.'
Now, whilst I can't meet you all face to face, do as I do   and you won't get done.
Court   sounds daunting and expensive.
Who, in their right mind,
would want to start legal proceedings if it could be avoided?
Let me tell you, it's not as bad as it sounds.
A couple of hundred pounds and a few hours' work could see a heavy weight lifted off your shoulders.
'Take Davina. Her quest for a perfect Christmas gift saw her wind up in court.'
Our son was six years old. He spends a lot of time up on the farm.
He sees the quad bike and says he'd love a quad bike of his own.
So we found a really good one on an internet auction site.
Finding the ideal present can be a total nightmare.
Supermum Davina, she had it sussed.
The bike arrived late November.
My husband started it to make sure that it started OK, which it did.
We put it in a shed until Christmas Day so Charlie wouldn't see it.
Come Christmas Day, Mum was happy, son was happy.
Everything was going smoothly.
Why do I get the feeling that things were about to go wrong?
As soon as Charlie saw the bike he was dying to go on it.
We geared him up in his suit and helmet.
He was soon whizzing around the field opposite the bungalow.
After a few laps of the field, the bike was slowing down and was cutting out.
My husband had a look and saw that the idling screw had popped out.
In a field full of mud and grass, we couldn't find the screw.
So we gave up on the bike that day.
There it is! The bike wasn't up to scratch!
Davina got in touch with the company
who promised to send replacement parts.
They never arrived.
It was about three and a half months we were waiting for a simple screw,
which was ridiculous.
When his website said he guaranteed next day delivery on spare parts,
to wait three and a half months was very frustrating.
We received a screw by Recorded Delivery but it was the wrong one.
'Fed up with waiting, Davina took the bike to a mechanic
'to see if he could get it going.
'He couldn't get a screw to fit but he discovered
'the flywheel and casing were faulty.
'It was going nowhere   with or without an idling screw.'
This gets worse and worse. Davina's son had a bike he couldn't ride.
Davina was out of pocket and I bet Santa was cheesed off as well.
'Davina got back in touch and the new parts were sent.
'Again, they were the wrong sort and the seller went quiet.
'Weeks turned into months.
'More e mails and letters were sent with no response.'
Only one place for Davina to go  
the local court or small claims court, call it what you like.
It should be a last resort, but it is a very effective one.
'Davina put in a claim for the full price and all her postage costs,
'a total of £380.
'This is how she did it   all without setting foot in a court.'
You start your claim. You can do it online.
It can be at any court in England and Wales.
You'll have to pay a small fee, which varies between £100 and £225,
depending how much you're claiming, which can be a maximum of £5,000.
We filled the application online.
We had to send all the documentation
to the local court regarding the case,
together with the application form.
Within a short space of time, we received notification
that they'd found him guilty of owing us money,
and a CCJ had been awarded for the full amount plus court fees.
It's not as scary as you think. You don't have to take a solicitor.
It gives you a chance to explain your side of the story.
Although it adds a black mark on the credit record of the debtor, it can't enforce payment.
Don't be afraid of the small claims court. I've been there myself.
I won, and it was quite a good experience.
'I've been going bumper to bumper with RED Driving School
'after receiving complaints from would be driving instructors whose careers were stalled.
'At least RED have started to look into the cases now.
'They assure me that all cases were either already being processed
'or had not been brought to their attention.
'They say they had resolved one before I'd even called.
'What about the rest of my cases? They all bought a dream sold by RED.
'While the claims are not, technically, untrue,
'our cases show that the reality is far more complex and less exciting.
'RED say...'
'RED aren't the only company with a well practised sales pitch.
'Make sure you know what you're buying into.
'It seems RED have been listening.
'Following a mammoth round of e mail tennis, I think I served an ace.
'They don't want to talk to me again
'but their final e mail has some very interesting news.'
For those of you itching to find out about RED Driving School,
stay tuned cos you're about to find out.
Guys, hello.
Good to see you both again. A lovely spot to meet in.
  The Ace Cafe on the North Circular.
  Superb.
  It's steeped in history.
I thought it's a nice place to have a chat about what's been going on.
It has not been easy. I made quite a lot of phone calls.
I think it's safe to say, as far as RED Driving School goes,
you've had your first lesson.
Certainly have. Don't sign anything until you've had legal advice.
  Yeah.
  Don't jump the gun.
You got sold a dream and this wonderful idea.
  You put pen to paper and thought it was the end of your problems.
  Yes.
  Mark, you haven't hit 12 months yet?
  No. I've got two weeks to go.
If you paid it today, it would be how much?
  About 3,000.
  In a couple of weeks' time?
  Just under 8,000.
  You haven't got a pot, have you?
  No.
  You're skint?
  Yeah.
Looking at my options, the only option I have is to go bankrupt.
  And possibly lose my home.
  It's scary.
Let me read the full statement of your case, Rob, from RED.
"Mr Tucker informed us of his poor health in April last year.
"As a gesture of goodwill, we will cancel Mr Tucker's agreement."
  God!
  They've wiped it.
Thank you.
I'm...gob smacked.
Right. End of your problems.
How do you feel?
I feel...brilliant.
I didn't expect this.
'Mark's about to face a huge debt and wants his contract cancelled.'
Mark, your statement. "Mr Thornton raised a concern with us August last year.
"As a gesture of goodwill, we will cancel Mr Thornton's agreement."
You also have got a second chance. They've wiped your slate clean.
I don't know what to say. I really don't know what to say.
I didn't think they'd do it. Thanks to you for going after them.
Yeah. I can't thank you enough.
I've got some other good news for you.
I've got some lovely air fresheners. One for you, Mark.
Just to remind you every time you look in the mirror.
Look at that and think, "I'm going to think twice
"before I sign an agreement again."
  No.
'RED have agreed to cancel both Rob and Mark's debts, about to hit £7,500 each.
'A total of £15,000   what a result!
'Plus, RED have proposed a solution for my five other cases.
'They can go on an intensive course,
'allowing them to pack their lessons into a shorter period.
'to put them back on the road.'
I'd like to say to Dom, thank you very much
because we couldn't get anywhere.
I'll ring her tomorrow!
'Since we recorded this programme,
'RED have new owners and told me that some parts of the business
'are set to change for the better.
'Hopefully, no one will have a problem with RED in the future.'
It's still sinking in. Dom's done the business and he's got a result.
Dom's managed to do something which I couldn't do in all the months.
I recommend anyone, if they've got a problem, get in contact with Dom.
It's mind numbing, absolutely unbelievable.
