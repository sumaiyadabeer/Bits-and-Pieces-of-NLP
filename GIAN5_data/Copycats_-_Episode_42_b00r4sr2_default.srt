  Yeah!
  Hey hey!
  Hello!
  Hello!
  Welcome to Copycats, the game show where copying is good.
The aim of our game is for our families
to claim as many points as they can
because only one family can win a special, secret Copycats prize.
Ooh!
  Shall we meet the families?
  Let's meet them!
First off, we've got Emily's family from Middlesex!
We've also got Jordi's family from Woking!
That was awesome. Families, welcome to Copycats. Nice to have you here.
Emily, you're head of your family. Introduce the rest of your crew.
  OK, this is my brother Joe. He can do the worm.
  Hi.
This is my friend Tainton. He can do an awesome Mr T impression.
You fool!
This is my drama teacher Candace and she's a really good friend.
  This is my mum. She can do very odd impressions.
  I won't be doing those.
And this is Tainton's dad Sid.
And he's known my mum like all of his life, really.
Emily's family, lovely to have you on the show. Good luck.
Over here, Jordi, you're head of the family. Introduce your team.
My friend Matt is a mad hockey player.
My friend Mark is a fantastic fencer.
  Nice!
  This is my godmother 'Monne.
  She's walked on hot rocks, so be careful.
  Oh, hello!
  All right.
This is my dad Justin. He does yoga every morning.
This is my mum.
She's a huge football fan and she screams at the TV.
The first thing we need to do is to decide who will play the first game.
Mark is about to mime something.
The first family to identify what it is will choose
whether they play first or second. Watch carefully.
Oh, they just got it. Emily?
  He's miming an elephant.
  I am miming an elephant.
That was very close. Emily's family, you guys now get to choose
whether you go first or second.
  I want to go second.
  That means Jordi's family are going first.
Let's play Copycats!
This first round is Mime Time.
Matthew, you'll pick one of these cards.
You'll have ten seconds to mime the action on that card
for Shelley and so on down the line.
  Close the doors!
  Close the doors!
Blue, silver or red?
Silver. Take a good look.
You got that? You think you can mime that?
All right, good luck. Ten seconds starting from now.
Look at this.
All right...
Take a good look, Jordi.
This is good miming.
All right, Simonne, your turn.
Justin's nodding away. Nice.
  All right!
  Brilliant.
Justin, for a maximum of 50 points, any idea what Mark was doing there?
  Swimming.
  It wasn't.
  No.
We're playing for 40 points. Mark, what was Simonne doing there?
  She was swimming front crawl.
  Ohh!
Not that one. Nice thinking, though.
So, for 30 points, Simonne, any idea what Jordi was doing?
Swimming THE crawl.
Not that one. This is agony!
OK, Jordi, for 20 points, what was Shelley doing?
  Breaststroke?
  It wasn't breaststroke. OK...
  So, for 10 points, Shelley, what was Matthew doing?
  Butterfly?
It wasn't butterfly. I'm sorry, we have to be so strict on this show.
  Matthew, tell everybody what it was.
  Having a paddle.
So, unfortunately, guys, I'm sorry, but you get no points.
  Aw!
  Aw!
Let's see how Emily's family do.
  Close the doors!
  Close the doors!
  Red or blue?
  Blue.
  OK, have a look at that.
  Got that in your head?
  I have.
Your ten seconds start now. Open the doors.
Emily's smiling. Good sign.
  Even did a bow at the end!
  Brilliant.
Some interesting variations there, but, Tainton,
for the maximum of 50 points, what was Carole miming there?
Playing the violin?
  Yes!
That means Emily's family get 50 points!
And that also means that, Emily's family, you guys won that round,
so you can play or pass on the next game.
If you complete the challenge successfully, you get 50 points,
but if you fail, 25 points go to the other family.
  We're in!
  They're in. All right!
That means that Emily's family are about to play Star Strike.
Welcome to Star Strike.
This game is a lot like tenpin bowling
until you step on to the travelator.
Whoa oa! Ha!
  Well done. The aim of this game...
He didn't deserve a round of applause for that!
You must knock all of the celebrity pins down before the time runs out.
In three, two, one, go!
Here we go... Oh!
  Off you go, Joe.
  Go on, Joe!
Go on! Big throw!
He will not come down!
Yes!
Keep going! Come on, Sid!
Yeah!
Yeah!
  Go for it, Joe.
  Come on, Joe.
That was a great shot.
Go! While he's rocking, while he's rocking!
Gary Lineker, will you go down?
Go on, Emily!
Go on!
Go for it, Joe!
OK, here we go.
  Fearne is still rocking!
  Come on!
Come on! Fearne is still rocking!
Go on, go on! She's rocking!
Big throw, big throw!
Unlucky!
20 seconds left, guys. Come on.
This is a good throw... Anne Robinson!
Yes... Oh!
Nine, eight, seven...
Six, five, four,
three, two, one...
  That was tough!
  Sorry about that. You had to knock all the pins down.
So that means 25 points automatically go to Jordi's family.
So the scores after that round are:
The next round is called Quick On The Draw.
All right, Justin, you are going to pick a card.
You'll then have ten seconds to draw whatever is on that card for Mark
  and so on down the line. OK?
  Close the doors!
  Close the doors!
OK, mate, blue, silver or red?
Looking confident, Justin.
Good luck, mate. Your ten seconds start now. Open the doors.
Keep watching, Mark.
Time to spare! OK...
I can't do it now.
Ohhh...
I don't know.
Oh, no.
  Well...
This doesn't get any better than this.
Matthew...
For 50 points, mate, what has Shelley drawn there?
A kind of fish, a snake?
  A snake fish?
  A snake fish?
It's not a snake fish.
For 40 points, OK, Shelley, what has Jordi drawn there?
The Loch Ness Monster?
It's not the Loch Ness Monster. I'm sorry. Open the doors.
For 30 points, Jordi, what has Simonne drawn there?
  Alien?
  I see where you're going!
But it's not, mate, unfortunately. OK, let's open the doors.
  Simonne, I'm looking...
Now, this...is interesting.
That looks like a mushroom... Mushroom?
Right, well, Jordi's family get 20 points.
Close the doors!
Close the doors!
  Emily, red or blue?
  Blue.
  Take a look.
You're looking a bit worried there. Do you reckon you can draw that?
  Yeah...
  Yeah.
All right, the best of luck. Emily, ten seconds starting from now!
Not bad at all. Take a good look, Joe.
Fast!
Good copying. All right, Joe, your turn.
Good copying.
Time to spare! Oh, here we go, right.
  Nice! All right...
  Very good copying.
  Carole, for 50 points, any idea what that is?
  I'm hoping it's a very good picture of a starfish.
  It is!
  Look at that!
  Fantastic!
  Well done, guys. You got the full 50 points!
And that means you guys won that round,
so you now get to choose whether you play or pass on the next game.
If you do the challenge successfully, you get 50 points.
But if you fail, 25 points could go to Jordi's family
for doing absolutely nothing.
  Play!
  Play!
  You're going to play!
In that case, it's time to play Barmy Boot Shoot.
Welcome to Barmy Boot Shoot.
Here is how the game works.
Each member of our family has a remote controlled football boot.
The aim is for you to work as a team to dribble that ball into that net.
Once you get a goal, we chuck in another ball cos we're barmy.
You are barmy. To get 50 points, you need three balls in that net
before the time runs out.
If you don't, 25 points go to Jordi's family for doing zilch.
All right, the best of luck. In three, two, one, go!
  That is not a good start.
  Oh, it's moving.
Come on, come on! Come on, come on!
  What a goal!
  Yes!
  That was close.
  This is good, guys. You've got plenty of time.
You only need two more goals, guys.
Work as a team, remember.
Come on, guys. Get it out of that corner. Well done!
  Brilliant!
  OK, give it a good boot!
Well done.
Here we go, here we go, a good whack!
  It's going the right way.
  Go on, go on!
  Well done, yellow!
  Go, go, go!
Come on!
The green's acting as a goalkeeper!
Come on!
Anything, please!
Oh, no!
  There's 30 seconds left, guys. You need two balls.
  Come on!
  30 seconds left.
  Yes, yes, yes!
  Go, go, go!
Come on! Come on, purple!
15 seconds left. Come on, guys.
Ten, nine, eight...
Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one...
  Good attempt, guys, but you needed three goals.
  I'm shattered!
So that means 25 points go to Jordi's family!
So that means Jordi's family pick up another 25 points.
The next round is called the Sound Round.
Simonne, you will pick a well known tune.
You will recreate that tune using this instrument.
  Yes, smooth!
  In that way?
  Just like that!
  Good luck.
  Close the doors!
Close the doors!
Simonne, pick either red, blue or silver.
  Blue.
  Going for blue, OK...
Any idea? Doesn't matter. We'll play it into the studio.
Could everybody put their headphones on, except for Simonne,
so that they do not hear what tune is being selected?
Brilliant, OK. This is the tune that you've just selected.
At first, when I see you cry y y
It makes me smi i ile
Yeah, it makes me smile...
  Simonne, have you got that?
  I think so.
  Brilliant. Good luck to you.
  Thank you.
  Ten seconds start now. Open the doors. Headphones off.
Not bad. OK...
Wow... Wow!
You guys have been a nightmare in these rounds!
Bless you!
Mark, tell us what Shelley was playing on the kazoo/trumpet.
I don't know. Love Games?
No, it's not. It's not Love Games.
For 40 points, Shelley, what was Jordi playing there?
  Do You Know The Muffin Man?
  It's not that.
Moving on, for 30 points, Jordi, what was Justin playing?
  I have no idea.
  I have no idea either!
  Take a wild guess.
  You might get it right.
  I've still got no idea.
We're moving on. OK, for 20 points, Justin, what was Matthew playing?
I have no idea. The Simpsons? I don't know.
The Simpsons theme tune? It's not.
OK, for 10 points, Matthew, what was Simonne playing there?
The first song which I heard was Livin' La Vida Loca.
That is not the correct answer. Simonne, tell us what it was.
It was Smile   Lily Allen.
At first, when I see you cry y y...
Sorry, guys. Unfortunately, Jordi's family get nothing.
Let's see how Emily's family do.
Close the doors!
Close the doors!
Could everybody except Emily put your headphones on?
All right, Emily, pick a card.
  Silver.
  Silver.
  Do you think you know that?
  No.
We'll play it into the studio, so get the melody in your head.
We'll play it in right now.
All right, the best of luck. Ten seconds start now.
Keep going, Emily!
Wow!
Nice!
All right, Carole, your turn. Go!
All right, Tainton, your turn. Headphones off, headphones off.
  Very good. Very good.
OK, right, for a maximum of 50 points,
Candace, any idea what Tainton was playing?
Oh, when the saints go marching in...
  Yes!
  Excellent.
  Very good.
  Well done.
Emily's family get 50 points!
All right, so the scores on the doors are:
Jordi's family, it is still all to play for
as we now go into our final round   Hamster Ball Havoc!
Welcome to Hamster Ball Havoc.
Whichever family has the most points after this game will go home
with that fantastic family prize!
And this is how it's going to work.
Our families will try and get through this obstacle course...
Hello! ..as quickly as they can without knocking over any balls.
Every time they do, 25 points will be deducted from their score.
Bad times.
The first team to cross this finish line will win themselves 100 points.
Jordi's family are in the orange hamster balls
and Emily's family are in the purple hamster balls.
All right, here we go. Here we go, hamsters.
In three, two, one, go!
It's Simonne leading out for the oranges
and it's Tainton for the purples.
Tainton takes his first pillar out and that's a 25 point penalty.
Simonne goes clear and races out of the studio.
Tainton nudges the pillar, but the ball stays on.
Simonne going well down the back straight and here comes Tainton.
Bang!
Simonne clips a pillar
and that's the first 25 point penalty for oranges.
It'll be team captain Jordi taking the second lap.
Tainton finishing his lap and Jordi takes out the same pillar.
25 points gone!
That's Emily's brother Joe on the second purple lap.
Joe goes clear this time round as Jordi heads out the studio.
I tell you what, there's not a lot between these teams so far.
Whoa, Jordi bumps Joe into the pillar! That's going to hurt.
But it's Joe who crosses the line in the lead
and hands over to big Sid on the last lap.
Jordi crosses the line too and Mark takes the oranges' last lap.
This could be a close finish.
They're into the last pass of the pillars and there's nothing in it!
I think the oranges are going to do it...
And they do. What a comeback for the oranges!
Come over here. Wow!
That was a great race.
So fast. Unbelievable!
OK, Emily's family, you came second in that very, very close race.
And also you knocked over two of the balls.
So Emily's family's final score of the day is:
  Good score.
  Great score.
Jordi's family, you guys won the race. Well done.
You earn yourselves 100 points, but you did knock over two of the balls.
So Jordi's family's final score is:
Let's look at what you've won.
Tread the boards at a top West End theatre
and tour backstage at a big West End musical
on this Theatre Kids' Club prize!
  Sadly, everybody, it's the end of the show.
  No!
Bad times.
  Bye!
  Bye!
Join us next time on Copycats!
