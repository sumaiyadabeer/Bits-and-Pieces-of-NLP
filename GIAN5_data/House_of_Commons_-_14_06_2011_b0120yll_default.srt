the beginning of this crisis. I would like to see the moderate
members of the regime to do so again. Interest has exceededlet the
time available. We must on. Urgent question Mr Jamie Reid. Thank you,
Mr Speaker. Can I ask the Secretary of State to update the House on the
government review of waste policy in England. Mr Speaker, I have laid
in the library copies of the waste review to which we received 1800
responses. The government's waste review looked at all aspect of
waste policy and delivery in England. We want to make it yesier
for people to do the right thing and recycle more. Today's are you
view is good news. We will make it easier for people to recycle and
councils specifically to cut the scope of collections. We will
remove the criminal sanctions applying to householders so that
households aren't menaced for simple mistakes. We also propose to
introduce a harm to local amenity to tackle neighbours from hell,
ensuring enforcement is targeted at those who deliberately break youth
law. The review is good for business. We are abolishing lotts
because they offer certainty about landfill tack tax. The escalator
will move from �8 to �0. We are announcing a voluntary agreement so
that recycling services can be better exercised. Energy from waste
will be a key technology in the future. Today's review is good for
the environment. It will start consulting on restricting wood
waste from landfill and go on to review the feasibility of bands on
metal, textiles and biodegradable wastes. The review changes the way
transforming waste to resource. We have set out a clear direction for
cutting landfill, preventing waste and increasing recycling. It's
barely credible, no wonder DEFRA is seen as the political equivalent as
the mad woman in the attic. Today's announcement has been spun to the
media before it has been led before Parliament. Amongst the spin was
another broken promise, this time on weekly bin collections. Both the
Secretary of State for DEFRA spent their time in opposition promising
the public that weekly bin collections would be introduced.
Today, we discovered this is not the case. Before the election the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said, to much
acclaim, amongst his own party, "it's a basic right for every
Englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their chicken
teebg ta masala in their bin without having to wait for two
weeks for to be it to be collected". Why is it that the government's
position has changed? Can she also explain to the House today, is she
happy that this waste review contains no recycling targets at
all for England. The UK's recycling comind under the European Union are
going to be met on the backs of recycling targets in Wales,
Northern Ireland and Scotland, is that right? Can she also tell us
why it is that she choose, on becoming Secretary of State, to
abandon the last Labour government's consultation on
stopping wood going to land fill, to waste a year and today
reintroduce it? Instead of taking the chance to reduce recycling and
reduesz waste this government aband Bann on the other hand's Labour's
target. There is more to do. Today's announcement fails to
establish a frame work for the green world that this country needs.
The Secretary of State should today explain why it took so long and
looks set to deliver so little. Speaker, first of all, I would like
to make it clear that the written ministerial statement was available
to members of the House before I spoke to the chartered institute of
waste management. Of course, the government will work with all
parties to increase recycling rates. The recycling target is a European
target of reducing by 50% by 2020. I'm confident we are on target.
This is a devolved matter also for the other nations. Mr Speaker, it's
a bit rich coming from the opposition, who had 13 years, to
get to grips with landfill. It could, if he had so wand wanted,
got on and banned wood and materials and textiles and metal fs
it had so choosen to do. I fear the opposition is in denial about the
dreadful economic legacy it has left to the government. Mr Speaker,
he asks about green growth. Mr Speaker, I have just spoken to the
chartered institute of waste management and shared with them the
fact we estimate that there will be a growth of 34 to 4% per annum in
green jobs through the waste industry because of the positive
frame work we are setting out to help people do what they want to do,
the right thing, waste less and recycle more. That the Secretary of
State laid before the House today, may I share with the Secretary of
State that the district council serving my part of North Yorkshire
will be on their way to making the target she has set. There will be
preverse implications of abolishing the LAX because rural communities
have done well out of. That could I ask the Secretary of State on
anarobic digestion, it is welcome it will be increased. It deals with
waste food, what are the implications from other energy  
from waste facilities going forward in the next few years? Well, Mr
Er, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Select
Committee Warm Welcome to the government's waste review and the
recognition, I think, that LATS fulfiled a role. The landfill tax
has largely overtaken its impact in helping us reduce the amount that
goes to land fill. At the same time as publishing the waste review, I
have published the government's's die gection strategy. It's very
important. The Select Committee Chairman makes an important point.
Not just food waste that can be used as a feed stock, we must be
careful that food crops are not caught in as feed stock. We should
be using waste. Thank you Mr Speaker. I expect the Communities
Secretary eats more chicken tikkamasala than the DEFRA
secretary. Does she agree with me, however, that the chicken tikka
masala remains would be much better put into a food collection than
into a sack. Will she made progress on further recycling and what does
she think of the Friends of the Earth target, which I very much
support of, of halving black sack waste by 2020? I can tell the House
I have to feed the teenageres who are partial to chip chicken tikka
masala, there is very little left at the end of the day. We will make
it easier to make recycle and tackle measures which encourage
councils to cut the scope of collections and support them where
they wish to provide a weekly collection for smelly waste.
welcome the publication of the review today. Does my right
honourable friend agree with me, if we address the challenge of the
regularity of waste collection we need to, particularly look at pages
5 on wards of the report in relation to the management of food
waste. What will the government be doing to reassure people that, in
fact, we will meet targets to reduce food waste going into the
chain? There is a lot of
interest, and little time. Speaker, I thank my honourable
friend for a question which shows he read the review. He will know it
contain as startling fact we currently waste �12 billion of food
waste. Something we can ill afford to do. We need to work with all of
those involved in food production and packaging to try and minimise
the amount of food waste. Why is she sparing the Community
Secretaries blushs wasn't it a nonsense to force local authorities
to re introduce weekly collections. Would she confirm there a strong
core laition between high recycling rates and alternative weekly
collections? It's important we encourage councils to response to
what local people want and need. That is the very essence of
localism. Therefore, we will be proceeding with a new commitment
from councils to redouble their efforts to listen and respond to
the wishes of their residents in the matter of refuge collection.
is unacceptable to have rotting food waste hanging around for two
weeks in bins bins. Will she tell councils she would hope they would
have weekly collections so we don't have the danger and risk of that
situation? I said in response to an earlier question from the honably
lady we believe it's important to support local authorities that want
to provide a weekly collection of the smelly parts of the waste. And,
DEFRA will make available �10 million to assist them in that.
Secretary of State is adept at U  turns why is she hanging on to this
U turn which she could have left the Communities Secretary have his
very own U turn today? I might remind the honourable gentleman we
are a coalition government. A government of two parties and...
And he might... And he might like to read the coalition
agreementments commitment is that the government would work towards a
zero waste economy and encourage councils to pay people to recycle
and reduce littering and measures to produce a huge increase of
energy through waste, as set out out in our review today. I think
her for the flexibility, in contrast to my honourable friend
ahead of me. My local authority works with the private sector. They
provide a two weekly service but a weekly food waste. The key factor
has been the flexibility of a good contract with the private sector.
Would she not agree that those local authorities who have been
dogmattic about not using competitive tendering should think
I agree that waste services are a matter for local authorities. The
Government believes that better procurement and joint working can
improve the efficiency of collections while improving the
front line services for the public in an affordable and practical
manner. Five years ago, the Conservatives in Newcastle and line
made the same promise then promptly broke it. Then they spend �2.5
million of their Liberal Democrat friends on a complicated recycling
scheme with 10 different bins, boxes and bags which has turned
Newcastle into a curiosity. We could not now afford to reinstate
that collections. Order! I did appeal for short questions. Isn't
the Government's pickle over this reflective... Mr Speaker, I think
the most important message is that the Government is trying to make it
easier for people to do the right thing, so whether you are at home
trying to do with your household refuse, at work, or on the go, we
need to make it easier for people to waste less and recycle more.
Does the Minister accept that developing technologies can turn
waste into bile fields and chemicals? Was she encourage such
plans and will she support those currently being put forward to?
am not aware of the specific technology being developed, but I
would be delighted to learn more about it. It is important that we
embrace all new technologies. I have mentioned anaerobic digestion
for which I have set out a strategy, but there are new technologies
coming out all the time to turn waste into resource. It is all very
well hiding behind the language of local choices, her government
promised they would bring back weakly been collections across that
country. Will she apologised to families who have been led up the
garden path by what she has said? made it clear that the coalition
consists of two parties who struck an agreement. This includes
provisions regarding a waste which we are fulfilling two days. I said
that out very clearly. In contrast to the strong arm tactics of the
last government, in what way it do we have incentives to drive up
recycling rates? This is such an important point. The last
Government, with its punitive approach, lost the confidence of
the public by punishing a little old lady for making a genuine
mistake by putting it the wrong containers in a recycling bins.
Today, we restore a proportionate response to the penalties that
should apply, going after the rail waste criminals. There is not a
Liberal Democrat available to act as a human shield for the Secretary
of State! Can I ask the honourable lady what are the key issues at
local levels for Caen tonight for containment of    for containment
of waste. Also, what do Sucha    what does she suggest to a council
for this? There were incentives in the previous government, but it
actually deterred people. People will be we incentive rise to as
well councils, we want to help make it easier for small and medium 
sized enterprises to benefit. contrast to Cumbria's recycling
rate of 37%, Suffolk has over 60%, no doubt helped by regular weekly
collections of food. We are giving money to anaerobic digestion, will
she worked with me to make sure that more is available across the
country's? It is right to applaud householders in how they have
actively got involved in increasing recycling rates. That is what
people want to do. The Government's job is to make it easier for them.
That includes a collection for food waste. If that is what local people
want, we will support local authorities that do that. If the
cuts mean that councils cannot collect rubbish once a week, what
chance is there for the NHS or other services? I am not the
Secretary of State for Health, but I think the honourable gentleman,
just like everyone in his party, is in a complete state of denial about
the mess they left the nation's finances ins. I welcome the fact
that small businesses can now have the waste collected a, would she
therefore lobby her friends and hopefully introduce a renewable
obligation services Certificate for recycled kicking a which could be
used as a bio fuel. I will of course to discuss that possibility,
we work very closely together to draw together this review. I have
the largest incinerator in the country in my constituency. Which
reaches the end of its useful life in 2014. The replacement, and a row
about digest and it was cancelled because of PFI credits were
withdrawn. What reassurance can the honourable lady give my
constituents that your strategy will lead to the ending of
incineration in my constituency? have made it clear that energy from
waste has its place in turning waste into resource, but also I
made it clear today that the Government is committed to helping
local authorities that want to use anaerobic digestion and will make
funds available to achieve that. The Secretary of State, will she
congratulate Malvern Hills District Council and which he then District
Council, the former kept weekly been collections and the latter
moved to fortnightly collections. Both were recently elected for a
fourth term. That demonstrates that good local authorities that respond
to the wishes and needs of their resident, and supply refuse
collection services of good quality and sufficient frequency receive
their reward through the ballot box and I returned to it office. In the
Secretary of State's opinion, does the Prime Minister require a weekly
been collection to dump at the rubbish policies like the NHL's   
NHS reforms? I do not think that is it proper question with regard to
the waste review. The Prime Minister enjoys a very good refuse
collection service in his Oxfordshire constituency. The will
the Secretary of State explain why, if she wants to meet her waist
targets, the availability of feeding carrots have been reduced.
Why has she done that? That is more accurately a question for a
Government Minister from DC. With permission, Mr Speaker, and further
to the statement I made in the House earlier today, a wish to make
a statement on the Government's response to the NHS future forum.
We established it on sixth April under the chairmanship of Professor
Stephen Field to look at our proposals on them modernisation of
the NHS. Yesterday it published its proposals. I would like to thank
everyone who worked so hard these past eight weeks. I would also like
to thank more than 8,000 members of the public, health professionals
and representatives from some of 250,000 organisations. Also, the
thousands of people who wrote to us with their views. I would like to
thank the many officials in my department who supported this
unprecedented engagement across the country. I said two months ago to
the House that we would pause, listen reflect and improve our
plans. Our commitment to engage and improve the Bill has been genuine
and has been rewarded with an independent expert and valuable
recommendations from the future forum. We have allowed this for him
to continue its work, including implementing proposals on education
and training and public health. In the report, the NHS must change if
it is to respond to challenges and realise the opportunities of more
preventative, personalise and effective care. They said the
principles to NHS modernisation was to put patients at the heart of
care and to give clear initial    clinicians a central role in
commissioning health services. In the form's work they set out to
make proposals for improving the Bill. To provide reassurance and
safeguards and to recommend changes when needed. As Professor Field put
it, they did it to embrace change guided by the values of the NHS and
their relentless focus on the provision of high quality care and
improved outcomes for patientss. We will make significant changes to
implement those recommendations, and in some cases, offer for the
specific assurances which we know have been sold. There are many
proposed changes and we will publish are more detailed response
shortly. I would now like to tell the House for some of the main
changes we will make. The Bill will make clear that the Secretary of
State will have a duty to promote a comprehensive health service as in
the 1946 Act and be accountable for securing its provision and for the
oversight of the national bodies charged with doing so. We will
place duties on the Secretary of State to maintain a system of
professional education and training within the health service and a
duty to promote research. One of the most vital areas of
modernisation to get right is the commissioning of local services. It
must draw upon a wide range of the people when designing those
services, including clinicians, patience and patient groups, carers
and charities. Everybody will have two members, one body focusing on
the public and one focusing on key elements of government, such as
ordered, managing conflicts of interest. While we shall not
centrally prescribed the make up of the Government body, it will need
to include at least one registered nurse and one register specialist
care doctor. To avoid conflict of interest, neither should be
employed by a local health provider. These governing bodies will meet in
public, and publish their minutes. Clinical commissioning groups will
need to publish details of all contracts they have with health
service providers. To support commissioning, the Independent NHS
commissioning Board will host commissioning senates providing
advice on that shape and fitness of health care across a wider area of
the country. They will develop existing clinical networks who will
advise on how specific services like cancer, mental health or
stroke can be better designed to provide integrated and effective
care. Building on this multi  professional involvement, clinical
commissioning groups will have a duty to promote integrated health
and social care around the needs of their users. To encourage greater
integration with social care and public health, the boundaries of
these groups should not cross the Borders of local authorities. If
they do so, the groups will need to demonstrate to the NHS
commissioning Board a clear rationale with regards to the
benefit of patients. I have always said that I do not want there to be
no decision without me about need for patience when it comes to their
care.    patients. We will further clarify the duties on the NHS
commissioning Board and clinical commissioning groups to involve
patientss, carers and the public's. Commissioning groups will have to
consult the public and involve them on any changes which will affect
patient services. One of the main ways patients can influence the NHS
is by choice. The Bill will emphasise commissioners duty to
promote patient of toys. Choice of any qualified provider will be
limited to those areas where there is a national or local tariffs.
This tariff development, alongside a best value approach, will
safeguard against cherry picking. Monitor's core duty will be to
protect the interests of patients. We will remove its duty to promote
competition, instead it will be under a duty to support services
integrated around the needs of patients and the improvement of
quality. It will have power to tackle specific abuses and
restrictions of competition which act against patient interests.
Competition will be a means to buy high NHS commissions can improve
the quality of service. We will keep the existing competition rules
introduced by the last Government, the principles and rules for co 
operation and competition and give them a firmer statutory
underpinning. The corporation and competition panel will transfer to
Monitor and retain its distinct There must ab level playing field.
We will strengthen the role of health and wellbeing boards in
local councils making sure they will involved throughout the
kerbing process and local health service plans are aligned with
health and wellbeing strategies. We will make 9 timetable for change
more flexible to ensure no one is forced to take on new
responsibilities before they are readying while enabling those who
are ready to make faster progress. If any of the remaining NHS Trust
ks not meet foundation trust criteria by 2014 we will support
them to achieve it subsequently. All NHS Trust will be required to
become foundation trusts as soon as feasible with an agreed deadline
for each trust. We will ensure a safe and robust transition. It's
vital change is introduced carefully and without creating
instability. We will take the time to get it right as the future forum
has recommended. We will give them a clear home within the NHS family.
On any qualified provider its extension will be phased carefully
to reflect and support the viability of choice for patients.
Strategic Health Authorities and Primary Care Trust also crease to
exist in April 2013. By April 2013 all GP practices will be members of
either a fully or partly authorised commissioning group or one in
shadow form. There will be no two tier NHS. However, individual
clinical commissioning groups will not be authorised to take over any
part of the commissioning budget until they are ready to do so.
Individual GPs need not take managerial responsibility in a
commissioning group if they don't want to April 2013 will not ab drop
dead date for the new commissioners. Where a clinical commissioning
group is not able to take on some or all aspects of commissioning,
the local arms of the NHS Commissioning Board will commission
on its baf. Those groups keen to press on will not in anyway be
prevented from becoming fully authorised as soon as they are
ready. Mr Speaker, I also told the House on 4th April that we would
secure proper scrutiny for any changes we made to the Bill. In
order to do this, and without trespassing on the House's time to
review the Bill as a whole at report, we will ask the House to
recommit the relevant parts of the Bill to a public Bill committee
shortly. Mr Speaker, through the recommendations to the NHS future
forum and our response, we have demonstrated our willingness to
listen and to improve our plans. To make... To make big changes, not to
abandon the principles of reform, which the forum them sestselves
said were supported across the service, to be clear the NHS is too
important and modernisation too vital for us not to be sure of
getting the legislation right. The service can adapt and improve as we
modernise and change, the legislation cannot be continuously
changed. On the contrary, it must be an enduring structure and
statement. So, it must reflect our commitment to the NHS constitution
and values. It must incorporate the safeguards and accountabilities
which we require. It must protect and enhance patients rights and
services. It must be crystal clear about the duties and priorities
which we will expect of all NHS bodies and in local government for
the future. Professor Field's report says it's time for the pause
to end. Strengthened now by the forum's report and recommendations,
we will now ask the House to reengage with delivering the
changes and the modernisation the NHS needs. I commend this statement
to the House. Spl speaker, can I thank the Secretary of State for
the copy of his statement before. Although I must say, I learnt more
before hand from the press kefrpbgs conference press did from the
statement this afternoon. Humilitating. The Health Secretary
has had health policy taken out of his hands. He spent the last nine
months telling anyone who criticised the government's health
plans that they were wrong, and that they didn't understand. Today,
he admits he's wrong. How can he argue for this latest blue plipbt
for the biggest reorganisation in NHS history? With any credibility
or integrity? The man who messed up so badly last year, telling us how
he's going to mess up next year too. Why no apology to NHS patients and
staff for the wasted year of chaos, confusion and incompetence? Why not
apology for breaking the coalition agreement to stop top down
reorganisations? Why no apology to patients who are already starting
to see the NHS go backwards again because of this reorganisation?
More than one in ten people now waiting 18 weeks for operations.
Three times the number of patients waiting over six weeks for tests.
Casualty waits at a six year high. Mr Speaker, this is the first Prime
Minister forced to ask 45 experts for a roar report on how to protect
the NHS from his own government policies. Now, he's reorganising
his reorganisation. The future forum report yesterday was a
demolition job on the government's misjudgements and mishandling of
the health service. Why is he wasting �800 million on redundancy
payments when some of the same people will be rehired to do the
same job? Why is he holding back �2 billion, promised for patient care,
when it could fund 55,000 nurses? Why is he ploughing on with the
Health Bill when what he announced today could largely be done without
legislation and without the risk and cost of the biggest
reorganisation in NHS history? Mr Speaker, this is a political fix,
not a proper plan for improving care for patients, or for a better
or more efficient NHS, which is able to meet the big challenges it
must face for the future. Make no mistake, these plans today will
mean the NHS mired in more complex bureaucracy, more confusion, and
more wasted cost in the years to come. In the battle of spin, with
all parts of the divided government claiming a win, the big losers will
be the NHS patients. We will judge and the public will judge the
government on what they do, not on what they say. You know, I lost
track of the bureaucracy that he announced in his statement today.
Will he admit that this reorganisation creates five new
national quangos, set to spend tens of billions of pounds? Will he
admit this reorganisation replaces one local body, the Primary Care
Trust, with at least five others all playing a part in
commissioning? Will he admit the plans still cut hospitals loose
from the NHS with no limits on treating private patients while NHS
patients wait longer no. Support from the NHS if they run into
financial trouble. No longer with the protection as a public service
from the full force of competition law? Mr Speaker, what was a very
bad Bill will still be a bad Bill. This House should be allowed to do
its proper democratic job, as the only elected House, and scrutinise,
in full, in committee the whole Bill. At its heart will still be
the Tory long term plan to see the NHS set up as a full scale market.
And the NHS broken up as a national public service, so patients will
increasingly see the services they depend on, the Lottery of where
they live. The public, Mr Speaker, have rumbled the Prime Minister.
They know they can't trust him with the NHS. Fewer than one in four now
trust him to keep his NHS promises, over half believe the Conservative
Party's plans for the NHS are just a way to privatise the health
service. Today, the government have recycled their plans for the NHS
with should have been scrapped. People are right to conclude they
can't trust the Tories with our NHS. Well, Mr Speaker, when we got
passed the abuse I was hoping at some point he would actually tell
us whether he agreed with the NHS future forum or not? He didn't
mention it. He welcomed the exercise in listening and
engagement he announced. He said it would be the right thing. He said
it would be good government to do it. When an independent group of
experts report and make recommendations he ignores them and
says he will oppose the Bill regardless much he didn't listen to
what the people in the NHS were saying. It's's shameful he
dismissed everything that happened over the last year as if it didn't
happen at all. A year in which we, in this coalition government, said
we would increase resources to the NHS, and we have done that. We are
committing to �11.5 billion extra to the NHS over the next four years.
Money which we will continue to remind the British public, money
that the Labour Labour Party told us we should not give to the NHS.
And, this is a coalition government which, in the last year, and in the
NHS across the country which implemented a cancer drug trust
with 2,500 patients benefiting from that. Which cut in the last four
months the breaches of the single sex rules by three quarters in four
months. Which has cut the number of hospital infected by 22%, and CJD
infections by 15%. Three quarters of a million more people accessing
dentistry. Where the waiting times for people waiting to go into
hospital compared to March 2010 have gone down. Where we said we
would reduce management costs, and we will do so, we have taken 3,800
managers out of the NHS since the election, while the number of
doctors has gone up. The right honourable gentleman six months ago
said he supported the principles of the reform and the Bill. All he
said today is sheer opportunism but it will come back to haunt him
because the NHS is going to benefit from the changes that we are
proposing today. The NHS is going to take ownership of its own
service to a greater extent, patients will be empourered.
Clinicians will be empowered. They will deliver better outcomes for
patients. When that happens, we will be able to say the Labour
Party would have denied the NHS the resources and they would have
denied the NHS the freedom and responsibility to deliver those
better outcomes. Is not the key challenge facing the NHS today the
need to reverse a decade of declining productivity which was
left to us by the party opposite? Does my honourable friend agree
that his statement today provides the basis for us to do that, based
on the evolution of effective commissioning engaging the entire
clinical community, which will address the fragmentation of
service and progress the intergration of service around the
needs of individual patients? I agree with my honourable friend.
It's that process of now engaging clinicians coming together to
design services around around the needs of patients which delivers
improving quality of services for patients that is at the heart of
the shift from Primary Care Trust and Strategic Health Authorities.
The Labour Party spent a decade presiding over declining
productivity, over declining productivity while the cost of
bureaucracy and management in the NHS doubled. We are going to be
embow    empowered people in the NHS to deliver improving services
and reduce bureaucracy. The opposition front
bench shouldn't be yelling at the Secretary of State. Order on both
sides. Whatever the passions you need feel, you need to simmer down
a little. A fine example of that calm can now be provided by the
honourable gentleman. Does the Secretary of State Iraq recognise
that enforcing the NHS to start implementing his changes, before
the law had been changed, has reresulted in vast expense to the
NHS, chaos in the services and to diverting the NHS staff from
treating patients? Does he also recognise that just cobbling
together a few amendments to this Bill will not make things better,
but make things worse? Won't he recognise...
Last sentence, we must press on. Does the
Order. I will have the question finished I don't require
any help from any member. Doesn't the Secretary of State recognise
that by pretending to produce a collaborative silk purse out of
competitive pig's ear will not It is slightly confusing because
his right honourable friend on the front bench was telling us we could
have done this without legislation. Now he is accusing us of proceeding
without legislation. It is not true. We're doing things that are
essential. To sustain the structure we inherited from the Labour Party
in terms of all of these Primary Care Trusts and strategic help the
authorities, it could never have happened.    Strategic Health
Authorities. We had to empower clinicians in the service. We are
doing it now regardless of whether the legislation has made progress
or not. I welcome the statement. I have a list here of government
responses. It is seemingly not enough. It cannot be enough because
ironically it is a list of amendments tabled by the Labour
Party during the committee stage. Why does he think it is so hard to
build consensus? Why are the Labour Party being so pointlessly
churlish? I have to tell my honourable friend there are many
things that are beyond many of us to understand. One of them is the
Labour Party and the way in which they put policy. The fact is, the
Labour Party have no policy. They simply had opposition of four
opposition's sake. They just want is a two things. Questions and
answers must focus on the policy of the Government. That is the
Parliamentary position. Secondly, I want to a comedy at the level of
interest in the statement, but members must help me to help them
by being brief.    I want to accommodate. The last Labour
Government left dissatisfaction with the NHS. How much has this
year's shambles cost the NHS and how much has it damaged patient
care? It has not damaged patient care. The right honourable
gentleman, he should not denigrate the NHS. In May 2010 at the last
election, patients waiting to be admitted for hospital waited 8.4
weeks. On the latest figures that went down to 7.9 weeks. May 2010,
it went down to 3.7 weeks, and that is in the midst of rising demand on
the NHS. This is clear evidence of a listening government. Does the
Secretary of State agree with me that what the NHS now needs is
consensus across all political parties and for everybody to put
their money where their mouth is and support the NHS and these
changes as we move forward? It I am grateful to my honourable friend.
The future forum itself made to the point that across the NHS what they
want it is for the certainty of knowing what the policy is and of
moving forward in making that happen. In view of the NHS Future
Forum's comments, and I quote, the importance and relevance of the NHS
constitution were in guiding their work. Does he accept that the
principles set out in the constitution were more effective in
protecting the NHS from a hostile government than the Prime
Minister's five pledges? No, I do not accept that. I think the Prime
Minister's commitments are absolutely what the public and
people working in the NHS expect and wish to see. I think they are
vital ones and ones which would not have been true under a Labour
government. He Labour government would not have increased resources
for the NHS and we can see, we can see the only part of the United
Kingdom further is now a Labour government is in Wales, and in
Wales, resources for the NHS are being cut this year by 5%. When I
went to North Wales during the midst of the recess, there was the
front page of the Liverpool Daily Post saying the number of patients
waiting for their operation was more than 36 weeks. It had gone
from a 16 to 989. I welcome these proposals, but could the Secretary
of State to detail the safeguards against it cherry picking of the
kind which, if unchecked, could fatally undermine rural district
hospitals like the West Suffolk in my constituency. In order to be
brief, it essentially comes down to we have to make sure that
commissioners are increasingly able to use a tariff, and established
national or local price in order to determine the service that they
commissions. And that that it therefore does not allow the
private sector to come in and cherry pick services by
undercutting on price. We also have to make sure that that price
reflects the cost of that condition to be treated, including complex
conditions. This is why we are committed to work with the Royal
Colleges in developing tariffs to make sure that is true. I welcome
the statement, not least because it pays tribute to the future
commitment    future commission. Could the Secretary of State tell
me what he thinks the future of there Healthcare Commission is?
if I may interpret and relation to the NHS Future Forum, I freely
acknowledge that I wish we had instituted the NHS Future Forum
after the publication of the white paper last year. Although we had a
full and formal consultation process, I think the character of
the engagement that has been agreed over these last two months had been
superlative. As we make further progress, for example in relation
to education and training and the development of training proposals,
I want to ask the NHS Future Forum in that and other areas to continue
that process of engagement across the servers. I have a great deal of
time for most GPs, in particular the one sitting in front of me.
What part of this Bill will allow communities to rid themselves of
underperforming GP practices? answer to my honourable friend's
question is for it in order for that to happen, it is something
that would need to be initiated by the NHS commissioning Board. BNH is
commissioning Board would respond to their health and well being
board of its local authority. Or indeed to the local clerical
commissioning group. My noble friend will have, in his area,
through the Health and well being board the new and powerful means
from which the voice of the public can be heard. Can I just remind the
House that members who came into the chamber after the Secretary of
State began his statement, should not expect to be called.
Secretary of State must know that the bigger threat to the
destabilisation of the National Health Service is the introduction
of competition lot of clinical services. Will the clause that says
the mergers of NHS trusts are a matter for the office of Fair
Trading and competition be removed from the Bill? I think the right
honourable gentleman should be aware that the future forum has
recommended that those powers that are held by the office of Fair
Trading    Trading and the Competition Commission should be
done because they believe it is in the interest of the NHS for those
powers to be exercised by a health service specific regulator,
sympathetic and understanding to NHS interests. Primary Care Trusts
and Strategic Health Authorities are part of a management structure
which led to waste and bureaucracy. Can my right honourable friend
reconfirm there will be abolished and the �5 billion they will save
will be ploughed back into his phone line medical services? I am
grateful to my honourable friend, I can do that. It is essential we
moved to a world weary reduce administration costs, where we have
relieved bureaucracy in the service, where we provide resources to
deliver improving care without the burden of bureaucracy, cost and
waste which was inflicted on them by a Labour government. Doesn't the
Secretary of State understand that when the Labour government was in
power, it increased the money from 33 billion to 111 billion in one
decade and now we are witnessing a new Frankenstein monster all to
pacify these tinpot liberals! have a mission for the honourable
gentleman, I think he should head to Wales. In England, this
coalition government has committed to increase NHS budget in real
terms in the life of this Parliament. In Wales, a Labour
Government is intending to reduce the NHS budget by over eight
present. I believe the very act of listening to patientss and the
public will have done a lot to improve these proposals. Once the
dust has settled, it will have done good for at the Health Secretary's
reputation as well. Given the requirement for greater local
accountability, would he make the same recommendation to local,
clinical commissioners in the changes they are yet to make for
health services in their area? grateful for four and his kind
remarks, I have to tell him, I do not think I am looking to achieve
anything in terms of reputation. I just want a positive outcome for
the NHS. I have said to the House before, it is about achieving for
the NHS, the opportunity to deliver better services for patients. This
point illustrates what it is we needed to do, and will now do in
response to the future form. Many people wanted to see, set out in
detail in the legislation, high patient and public will work in
these respective bodies. There is always a balance to be struck
between the degree of prescription any legislation and the degree of
freedom. Clearly, we now half the approval for putting a much more of
this detail into the Bill because they are clear they will engage the
patients and the public's. welcome the changes, most of the
changes that have been announced today. Could I just ask one point,
I am very concerned that the bureaucracy that is going to be
around after all these changes go through could actually be worse
than what we have got at the moment. I genuinely would like to be
I'm am grateful to the honourable lady. The bureaucracy will reduce
in the NHS as a result of all this because we are shifting the
ownership of commissioning and the responsibility for the design and
delivery of services from what is essentially a distant, managerial
organisation into one that is locked into clinical decision 
making of doctors and nurses across the service. This is about
delivering benefits to patientss by empowering the doctors and nurses
to care for them. Can the Secretary of State confirm that the
Government has no plans to decrease the Budget on the NHS, unlike the
plans of the party opposite to slash it by �30 billion.
honourable friend makes an important point, because if we had
listened to the Labour Party we would have cut the NHS and not
increased resources. The 20 billion power and efficiency savings that
is required for the NHS in order to respond to demand and cost would
have been a �30 billion. It would have been an unsupportable degree
of pressure on the NHS. We're giving the NHS, not only resources,
but the opportunity to deliver better care. After the white paper
was published in July, there were 6,000 representations from health
select committee reports and professionals asking the Secretary
of State to think again about breaking up the NHS. This listening
exercise is a waste of public money. I know the Secretary of State was
That was nonsense. We spnded postively to the consultation and
made changes then. What is clear, as the details of the Bill have
been coming forward, people are working out how they would make it
work in the future. They have been saying, we want to set out in the
legislation how it will work. There is no better way of making that
effective than to talk to people and engage gauge with people in the
NHS, listen to them and implement those changes. I'm sure the
Secretary of State will agree with me that the single biggest
challenging facing healthcare in the United Kingdom is dealing with
the health economic and human challenge, looking after our ageing
population. The key to this is better intergrating healthcare
services, better intergration hospital services with community
and social services these reforms are a good way of going about that?
Yes, I would very much do so. I think the future forum in the
report, particularly on clinical advice and leadership, is giving us
a robust structure for engaging across the range of professions
that are capable of deliver that more joined up and effective care.
Can the Secretary of State reassure us that no services or hospitals
will be taken over by the private sector? There are no plans in the
legislation or indeed in the future forums recommendations that would
lead to that. In particular, if I might just tell the lady, she will
see in the detail, published with the written ministerial statement,
we are proposing there should be no power in particular for Monitor,
for reasons of competition to allow the private sector to have access
to NHS facilities and taking those away from NHS providers. Mr Speaker,
we have a Prime Minister who loves the NHS. A Secretary of State who
is the most experienced member in this House. We have a coalition
government that has done something that the Labour government never
did, it listen and was willing to improve its Bill. It is a great day
for democracy. I congratulate the Secretary of State and for
referring it back to committee. If he is looking for volunteers for
the committee, I'm available. grateful. From my point of view, it
is because I believe in the NHS, also because I believe in the
people who work in the NHS, that I believe it's right to listen and to
engage. And, it's right to give them a much greater control of the
service they provide for patients. Mr Speaker, what can we conclude
from the fact that the Prime Minister isn't here with us this
afternoon, supporting the Secretary of State, who is involved in a PR
stunt at St Thomas's and Guys Hospital. Isn't it true, the reason,
is as was said across the Atlantic, you could put lipstick on a pig, at
the end of the day, it's Stig a pig. Isn't that the truth of the NHS
Bill? I'm starting to get into matter perhaps not of order, but of
any rate of taste. If you will forgive me, Mr Speaker, I don't
think I will gratify that question with an answer. Will he expand on
the report that organisations such as the Spinal Injuries Association
can expect through specialised commissioning? Yes. I believe that
the NHS Commissioning Board, under our proposals, will be aib to able
to give greater consistent cyst si to specialised commissioning. I
hope it will be true for people with spinal injuries. I know the
Association well. They have done terrific work. We have worked
closely with them to improve commissioning and services for
those injured with spinal injuries. It is disgraceful to see Lib Dems
and Tories scrapping to claim credit for this alleged listening
exercise. Will the Secretary of State come to the dispatch box and
apologise to me and my colleagues for not listening to us during the
Bill Committee? Mr Speaker, I give credit in relation to the changes
that we are now bringing forward. Yes, indeed, to some of my
colleagues, very much so, also to the Prime Minister, the Deputy
Prime Minister for their time and trouble they have taken in relation
to. This they have spent a great deal of time listening and engaging
with people across the health service. And, we will give credit
to the NHS future forum and to the thousands of people across the NHS
who have made their contribution now to the NHS's future. I think
they will be very disappointed to hear members opposite who just want
to denigrate that and make political capital out of it rather
than supporting the NHS in it is future objectives. Collectively
throughout Oxfordshire told the Field Commission they wanted to get
on with GP commissioning. They were committed to GP commissioning they
believed they could be better designed NHS services for local
people. When are GPS in Oxfordshire going to be able to get on with GP
commissioning? I can assure my honourable friend, I know his GPS
locally. They want to work with their colleagues, professionally,
across their area. They want to be able to get on with that now.
