Hello, I'm Lucy. I live at 64 Zoo Lane
and I have some very special neighbours, look!
There's some with a hump And one who can jump
And one who is Well, a little bit plump
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Some like it hot And some like it chilly
And some like it both ways And that's a bit silly
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Some are friendly, some are scary
But one thing is sure Not one is ordinary
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
They're prickly and woolly And furry and slimy
Some are quite big And some are very small
And the last one's Georgina
Who's incredibly tall!

Bedtime, Lucy!
OK, Mum.
Wheeeee!
Hello, Lucy!
Hi, everyone. Look at this.
Oh, what have you got there, Lucy?
It's my sticker book.
I finally collected all of them. It took ages.
  Wow!
  Oh!
They're lovely, Lucy.
  Can we see?
  Of course!
Oh! Ha! What are those?
They're leftover ones.
I haven't decided what to do with those ones yet.
It's a lovely collection, Lucy.
Ha ha, does anyone remember Doris The Duck and her collection?
Ha ha! Go on, Molly, tell Lucy all about it.
One day, Doris the Duck was playing down by the river
with her friends, Kevin and Toby.
I need a bit more mud for the feet.
Stop digging, Kevin. I've just seen something.
Look at this! Hee hee!
Oh, isn't it pretty?
I suppose so.
What do you think, Toby?
Hmm, nice.
Nice? It's more than nice, it's beautiful!
I know, why don't we all collect precious things
and tie them to my vine?
But we haven't made a Toby sculpture yet.
Yes, let's do that first.
Mmmm.
Hee hee hee, that's really good!
  Hee hee!
  Oh.
I'll make one of you now, Kevin.
All right,
if you two don't want to help,
I'll just have to go collecting precious things all by myself. Hmm!
Doris' collection started well.
In no time at all she had found a lovely flower.
It's amazing what you can find just lying around,
if you keep your eyes open.
Oh! Look at that!
Hello, Audrey. I'm collecting precious things.
Oh, hello, Doris.
I'm looking for something nice and soft to line my nest.
Have you seen anything I could use?
Uh, like what?
I was wondering, Doris,
do you really need that lovely, soft feather?
It's just the right size for my nest lining.
No! You can't have it.
Everything I find is going into my collection of precious things.
I can't just give things away, you know.
While Doris was busy collecting,
Herbert the warthog was having a nice play on his musical rocks.
Oh, bother! Got to find another stick.
Ah ha! Just right!
Ha ha!
My stick!
Finders keepers.
That's not fair. How am I going to play my musical rocks?
Not my problem, Herbert.
Ohhh!
Ni ni ni ni ni!
This is going really well.
Hurry up, Tickles,
I've just found a ripe fruit on the bingolollyberry tree!
Yippee! I love bingolollyberries!
Hee hee hee!
Where's it gone?
It was here a few minutes ago.
Meanwhile, down at the river...
Hee hee!
Whee!
I wonder how Doris is getting on with her collection.
Let's go and find her.
Oh, oh!
Ooh!
It's too heavy, I need a rest.
I know,
I can display my collection here
and invite everyone to come and look at it.
Hello, Audrey, have you seen Doris?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.
She's collecting things.
I know. She collected a feather
that would have been just right for my nest.
Uh oh, I think we better find her before she upsets anyone else.
Roll up, roll up!
Come and see Doris's precious things.
Roll up, roll up!
Huh! Pah!
Roll up! Roll up!
Roll up, roll up!
Roll up!
Oh, why isn't anyone speaking to me anymore?
Have either of you seen Doris?
She's over there, you could ask her
if she's seen a certain bingolollyberry.
  Cos we're not speaking to Doris anymore, are we, Giggles?
  Huh!
  I think we better have a chat with Doris.
  Mmm.
  Doris!
  At last.
Kevin, Toby, come and look at my precious things.
This is a bingolollyberry. very rare.
And this is the softest feather is Africa.
And here's my special stick.
What do you think?
You've done really well at collecting things.
I have, haven't I?
  But...
  What?
Do you really need all these things?
Of course I do, it's my collection.
All of it?
I suppose the stick's a bit boring.
Mmm.
And the bingolollyberry tastes funny.
Doris began to realise that some of the things she had collected
might be more useful to other animals,
so she asked Kevin and Toby to help her put things right.
A bingolollyberry!
Ah, hmm.
It's fun giving things away.
Even more fun than collecting things.
Oh, what a pretty flower.
Why don't you have it, Natalie? It would look lovely on you.
Thank you, Doris, that's very kind of you. Ha ha!
Shame I've only got one pebble left.
Not much of a collection, is it?
Here, Doris, we found these pebbles
while we were making mud sculptures.
Oh, for me?
For you!
Hello!
Beautiful necklace, Doris.
Oh, ha, you like it?
  Oh, yes!
  Lovely!
Ha ha ha!
Doris the Duck was very, very happy
because she knew she had the best collection of friends
in all of Africa.
Thank you for the story, Molly.
That's a nice sticker.
Thank you, Lucy.
Thank you so much, Lucy, that's very kind of you.
We're very happy with the stickers you've given us.
Oh!
  And now it's time you collected some sleep.
  All right.
Good night, everyone!
Sweet dreams, Lucy!
