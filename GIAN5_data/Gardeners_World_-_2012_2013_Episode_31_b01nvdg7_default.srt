That's a nice one. Would you like that?
Hello, welcome to Gardeners' World.
Now, I'd just like to thank everybody who has sent cards
and get well wishes for Nigel.
It's completely gone to his head, he is now an insufferable prima donna
and only contacts me through his agent
but he is getting MUCH better, thank you very much.
To the extent that he is able to eat apples, aren't you? Want an apple?
Hang on a sec. Wait there.
Oh, go on!
Good boy.
Now, this is the last programme of the year, I'm afraid,
but we've still got lots on!
I shall be in the Jewel Garden,
tidying it up ready for winter, looking back over the highs
and some of the lows of the year,
and also planting for spring in the damp garden.
Rachel is visiting a blind gardener in Swansea
who, although she has never seen a plant in her life,
has still made an extraordinary garden.
'I love plants, they speak to me.
'They say something about the world and life,'
and it just makes you feel richer and better to be among them.
Joe is visiting an exceptional gardener too.
He's up in Lincolnshire growing fabulous veg on his allotment
at the age of 92.
And Carol is in Cumbria
in search of one of the rarest plants in the British Isles.
Look at it, it's perfectly at peace.
It's in its home, it's...
the flower I've come to see.
At this time of year it's always a trade off
between hanging on to what's good for as long as possible
and then just accepting that some things
are just not going to get better,
so they're going to look worse and worse,
so the thing to do is to clear them out of the way,
and there's a number of virtues in doing that.
Not only does it look better
but also it gives things around them a better chance.
A good example is in here.
You can see how this Cosmos, if I step through there, has fallen.
Now, the Cosmos have done really well this year
and they're still flowering strongly but it's a downward process.
Things are not going to get better.
It's an annual so what we can say is, "Right, you come out."
Just pull it out, to the compost heap with it, that's it.
Its job is done.
So that goes in the barrow.
This Lysimachia, which is not an annual but it's falling everywhere,
it's all wet and sodden, and it gets slimy and horrible.
So the thing to do is to cut that back.
And I think this is a job that wants to be done, really,
spread over two or three, or even four weeks.
Just come in there and work through, taking layers off as you go.
So...don't feel you need to get it all done perfectly first time round.
All the Buddlejas have done well.
That Buddleja, there, it's a weyeriana hybrid,
has gone on flowering and flowering and here we are, it's still going.
Certainly not going to cut that back in a hurry!
I wouldn't cut back this Euphorbia
cos I love the way that the moisture sits on it.
When the light hits it you get these dancing diamonds above it
but the Tithonia, in there, has had it.
I'm afraid that is now grey and sad but it doesn't matter
because it's been brilliant this year.
The Tithonia have been superb.
And, of course, if you are intending to put bulbs into your borders,
and I am, I want to put more tulips in,
then you need to clear at this time of year.
You can't leave it until next spring
because otherwise there's not space to plant
and you can't see where you want them.
Of course, the Jewel Garden doesn't really get going at all
until April, and this year
the wallflowers and the tulips
looked fantastic.
You get that first
intense colour of the year.
Then you go into high summer,
these plants come muscling in
with a burst of colour
and I thought the Jewel Garden
actually looked good this year.
I always said it would take two to three years
to reach fruition, and it's getting there.
And a lot of people have said it's been a bad year for gardens.
I don't think it has. I think it's been a bad year for GARDENERS.
It's been pretty miserable,
but plants, on the whole, have liked it.
There have been some exceptions but, on the whole,
they haven't done badly at all.
Of course, in the end, the Jewel Garden is all about colour.
It's about creating the palette and then managing it to maximum effect
for as long as possible, right through the season, and it's tricky.
However experienced you are
and however good you are at seeing colours, and using them,
it's quite demanding.
Well, if it's tricky for us, with good eyesight,
imagine what gardening is like if you're blind.
And Rachel has been down to Swansea to meet Andrea Gordon,
who has been blind from birth
and has yet made a wonderful garden from a blank canvas.
Well, we're surrounded, here, by this wonderful, leafy gorgeousness.
The plants are just, they're clearly very happy here.
What was the starting point of this garden?
Well, you see that little Acer, there?
That was, when I bought it, it was Â£2 in Woolies,
probably about ten years ago. It was about this high, in a little box.
Well, it's enormous now.
And then, tell me about the pond that's just in front of it.
I wanted a pond that I wouldn't accidentally walk into
so it's got raised up sides, to warn me that it's there,
and you can sit on the side
and dangle your fingers in the water, and feed the fish.
And the shape is just a regular
shape, like a lot of the shapes in this garden.
Quite straight lines to help me to navigate around it, really.
Now, don't tell me you dug that all by yourself?
No, no, my husband, Andrew, has the credit for digging that.
Before it was filled with water he dropped me in the middle
and I know, because, from personal experience,
it's, kind of, this deep in the centre.
Right, what about the planting that's just here to the side,
slightly, of the Acer?
In front of me, here, there is a bed with lots of conifers
that I like to have for the winter
because it means there's always something going on
and then around, to my right,
all the Astilbes, which love that slightly damp, heavy ground, there,
and have that same feathery feel to their leaves as the Acer.
This is great, isn't it?
Where has the passion for gardening come from?
I was sent away to boarding school when I was five
and I gained a lot of comfort and solace from being outside,
and walking through trees,
and touching the plants in the grounds always made me feel
that I was close to home.
I love plants, they speak to me.
They say something about the world and life,
and it just makes you feel richer and better to be among them.
What is it that draws you to a plant?
Mostly the texture and the overall shape of the plant.
Sometimes the fragrance but with the rosemaries, they're a lovely shape
and they have a beautiful fragrance
but the roses, of course, have their own loveliness
and when they are in flower, and there are some buds here,
and actually getting this close to them,
I can anticipate when they are going to come into flower,
and come and look for them.
What is it about roses that you love particularly?
I love the shape of the flowers but I love the feel
and I love the idea of planting something
that is really no more than a bundle of twigs in the autumn,
and then something incredible happens
where the next time you come there are all lovely soft leaves,
and eventually such stunningly lovely flowers,
and the fact I can plant it and that bit of magic happens.
What does the garden mean to you?
It's my little world.
It's...
I know every, every little bit of it intimately well.
I picture it in my mind.
I can be indoors and I see every little plant.
It gives me something else to think about,
other than some of the restrictions I have in my life,
and it's something positive and creative,
and it gives me joy, and it's where I come to play.
I think that what is really important,
whether you are sighted or not, is that intimacy with your garden.
Knowing every inch of it is just as valuable
as any amount of horticultural technique.
I have to pinch myself sometimes,
to think that we dug out the hole for the pond in February,
Joe helped me line it in March
and then we planted it up throughout April.
And by the end of May it was looking pretty established,
and by midsummer it looked as though it had been here for years.
And it just shows that it is not difficult
to add a pond to the garden and gain so much so quickly.
Of course, it's changing daily now.
By New Year, this will be devoid of leaves.
It'll be a bleaker, bonier place,
so I want to plant now to give it a bit of energy
and a bit of life amongst that bleakness
next February and March.
I'll give it that energy by using bark.
This is a dogwood.
Cornus alba 'Sibirica'.
It has the most fantastic red sheen to its bark,
especially when it's young.
These new shoots look at their very best
in the first few months of the year  
January, February and March  
which is when there is so little that is here.
I'll be able to see them because
all this cover will be gone.
That time of year, there is nothing blocking the sightline to it
or the light to it   that's facing south.
This will be flooded with light and these red stems will shine through.
At this point, I just want to get this in the ground.
Cornus are very adaptable.
Tend to think of them as needing wet conditions
but particularly Cornus alba will grow almost anywhere.
It does better in sunlight, though.
Don't give it too much shade.
This is a big plant, which...
..can just be popped in.
The name dogwood has nothing to do with dogs.
It's a corruption of a Scandinavian word, "dag",
and refers to a skewer or spike.
These stems are quite hard, given how young they are,
and they used to be used for skewers.
Occasionally, even arrows,
and that has come down to us as dogwood.
This is a fairly mature plant so you can see
that its got a pretty compact root ball.
When you've got roots like this,
it's not a bad idea to break them up a bit.
Stimulate them to grow away from this very compact mat.
I'm going to use a bit of mycorrhiza fungi.
There is no question that it does help the relationship
between the roots and the soil.
It speeds up that interactivity.
If you are going to use it, it is essential
that there is a direct contract from the mycorrhizae to the roots.
Don't just sprinkle it loosely.
Either do it where you know the roots are going to touch
or directly onto the roots.
And then into the hole too.
That can go in there like that.
Then just backfill.
Firm that in.
Give that a really good soak,
even though the ground is quite wet.
To have this looking at its very best,
it will need regular, dramatic pruning.
That means either cutting all the plant or half of it
right down to the ground every year.
That will stimulate new growth and it's the new growth
that has this fantastic colour.
Also, it means that I'll have lots of material to take cuttings.
My plan is to spread it round the back behind the pond
so when you come in here in March,
you'll see this blaze of red rippling around
the curve behind the pond.
It should look fantastic.
That's a Cornus alba. I've got another one
I want to plant over there.
This is Cornus 'Flaviramea'.
It has wonderful olive green,
yellow stems that intensify with colour in early spring, and makes
a good combination with the red stems of the Cornus alba 'Sibirica'.
It's a dogwood that prefers damper conditions
so if you've got a wettish spot,
it's the ideal plant.
This bit of the garden gets very wet.
When the flood comes in, it comes in here first of all
but this particular dogwood won't mind at all.
It's really good for a damp patch.
Carol has been to see an area which couldn't be more difficult.
She's visiting the coastline of Cumbria,
where you have fantastic sand dunes, which are wind blasted
and very often dry.
And yet, there's a range of plants that thrive there.
During the past year, I've been lucky enough
to wander around the British Isles, discovering all sorts of
wonderful wild flowers
growing in their natural habitats.
But today, I've come to a place which perhaps epitomises
all that is so special about these wild flowers
and the places they grow.
This is Walney Island,
a place I've always longed to visit.
I wanted to come and see for myself
the rich diversity of the flora
and the beautiful habitats
in which they grow.
But it's a special quest for me too
as I'm hoping to come face to face
with a flower which has achieved
almost mythical status, as far as I'm concerned.
But before I search for the flower that makes this place
so special, I want to take a closer look
at the plant that binds
this entire island together.
This is a typical sight on one edge of Walney Island.
It's this plant, Marram grass.
It binds the sand together
and creates these wonderful sand dunes.
This is the root of the Marram grass.
It's strong, robust. They invade the sand
and everywhere along these leaf nodes,
it's got the capability of making a new shoot.
Sometimes, after a storm, it can be completely covered,
buried, feet deep.
But it's undaunted.
It just thrusts these new shoots up
and keeps on going.
Look at the leaves. When it's raining,
they open up, flatten themselves
so they can drink in any rainwater that's available.
But when it's hot and dry or very windy,
They roll themselves up so they reduce their surface
to the very minimum.
It's perfectly adapted to living in pure sand.
This is my first visit to Cumbria's Walney Island.
But for Steve Benn, he gets to see it just about every day.
He's the manager of the North Walney Reserve,
which helps to conserve the island.
What's it like working here?
It's fabulous. I love it.
Mum and Dad used to bring me over here for weekends on sunny days.
We appreciated the fact we could run around
with just a pair of shorts on.
We didn't appreciate what the habitats were,
what the flowers and the birds and the insects were that were here.
Because of that, the need to protect it.
That's where I come in.
  Exactly! And you get a job.
  I get a job!
  And what a job!
A fantastic job.
These special habitats, it's not just one or two of them,
it's a whole series.
If you took a cross section, east to west,
you've got marine environment,
intertidal environment, the shingle environment,
your dune grassland, your heathland...
It's just rich, isn't it?
And it's in a relatively small area.
With so many habitats to explore,
I want to see the wild flowers this place has to offer.
We begin our search in the dunes.
Look at this for an absolute beauty.
It is so dainty and delicate and so very pretty.
  Dune pansy.
  Dune pansy.
I've only ever seen it in books.
  Is that right? Well, there you go.
  Isn't it special?
Plants here have to be really hardy. Real tough.
  This has to be the showiest one here.
  Gorgeous.
Probably one of the showiest on the island.
  Glaucium flavium. The horned poppy.
  Yep.
So called because of these seed pods.
That's something you've just taught me   I wasn't aware of that.
When it goes brown and the whole thing is ripe,
it splits asunder and all these seeds
fly all over the place.
  Fabulous dispersal mechanism.
  Yes.
And perfect adaptation, like all these other plants too.
My dad always said   a brilliant gardener   he always said,
"Come here, look at it, appreciate it
"and leave it for the next person."
I love that.
I couldn't agree more with that philosophy.
My first glimpse of this island has been memorable.
Before leaving, I want to find the flower I've longed to see,
growing in its real, wild home.
Here, amongst the sand dunes on this steep slope,
carpeted with beautiful flowers of Geranium sanguineum.
But just over here, look what I've found!
The flower I've come to see.
It's Geranium sanguineum lancastriense.
It grows only on Walney Island.
Look at it. It's perfectly at peace.
It's in its home.
I love gardening.
I love putting plants together and seeing flowers in my garden.
But when you come out into the wild,
and you see flowers growing,
as they're supposed to be, in their very own
natural surroundings,
there's something much more moving
about it.
It's a much deeper experience.
It's just six weeks till Christmas.
It was six weeks ago to the day
that I planted those paper white daffodils,
which are just coming into flower.
But if you buy some paper white daffodil bulbs
and pot them up, put them somewhere warm,
give them a bit of water, I bet you that they are flowering for you
on Christmas Day.
Even if you don't want to plant daffodils,
here are some things you can be getting on with this weekend.
If you've got a cold frame or a greenhouse,
it's a good idea to give it a thorough clean
before winter sets in.
All you need is warm water and detergent,
and some elbow grease.
This will get of pests and diseases that are lingering
and, most important of all, let in maximum winter light.
As you put the garden to bed for winter, don't neglect
to look after your tools.
Now is a good time to sharpen your secateurs ready for winter pruning.
A tip is to take a felt pen
and mark a line along the edge of a the cutting blade.
Using an oilstone and working round and round,
remove that mark.
Turn the blade over and, keeping the oilstone flat
on the blade's surface,
work again to remove any burr
that is being turned over.
What should be left is a razor sharp edge.
If you've got a spare piece of ground in your vegetable garden,
dig it over.
Use a spade, not a fork
and leave it just as it falls.
The weather will work at it over the winter, breaking it down.
By next spring, you should just have to rake it over
and you'll have a fine tilth ready for use.
For more jobs you can do, not just this weekend,
but throughout the winter, go to our website:
The great thing about growing vegetables
is not only does it produce delicious food
but it's good for you, it makes you feel good, it's enjoyable.
It's never too late to start.
As Joe has found out, it's also never too late to stop.
Anyone who has had an allotment knows it takes dedication
and a lot of hard work to keep it going.
But that doesn't put some people off   oh, no.
A local lad from Grantham, Lincolnshire
has kept his plot going for over 40 years.
War veteran Walter Partridge is 92 years young.
From lunch time till dusk, you'll find this champion grower
tending his full size double allotment every day.
The produce is impressive.
When did you first start gardening?
When I was a boy, seven, eight years old,
my father had a little garden for me.
I say a little garden  
two square metres!
Something like that.
When I came out the Army and got married, I thought,
"Hmm. May as well have a go."
Your plot is immaculate. It's full of produce.
It's nice and tidy. Pretty much weed free.
It's not so good as it should be.
You know what it's been like this year.
All your years of experience, over 40 years on this allotment,
what would be your top tips if someone takes over a new plot?
Make compost deep. Crop rotation very important.
What crop rotation do you use here?
Potatoes, brassicas,
roots
and odd'n'sods!
I like that!
Potatoes, brassicas, roots, odds'n'sods!
Everybody got that?
This is where I keep my tomatoes.
I love your greenhouse.
It's an improvised one.
You don't say?
Full of character, just like you are!
  Will you try one?
  Which one is this, Gardener's Delight?
  Yeah.
  A good tomato, isn't it?
  Yeah.
Hmm. Ooh!
Good flavour, aren't they?
That is good flavour.
  Your leeks are looking fantastic.
  They're not bad.
  Not bad at all.
I'm jealous of your soil. You've been working it for over 40 years
so it must be pretty good stuff by now.
  Yes.
  Did you put a load of muck
  on there?
  Everywhere I'll dig it in.
What are your top tips with your Brussels?
Firm ground wherever possible.
Somebody once said to me, I don't know whether it's right,
the best brussels he ever grew, he made a hole with the crowbar.
They do like firm ground.
Really firm them in.
You've got to be pleased with these. It's been a good year for runners.
  What variety is this?
  Enorma.
  Enorma.
That row there is White Lady.
  Do you want to pick some?
  Shall I help you?
You can do if you find some.
There's millions of them!
I know you say crop rotation
but it doesn't hurt beans to grow them in the same place every year.
When they're finished, they do put nitrogen back in the soil,
from the roots.
They really are gorgeous. You've shown me your beans.
Now you want to look at the bees?
Yeah. Now can you show me the bees? Lovely.
Down at the bottom.
  How lively are these bees?
  Very lively.
Very lively? Is it safe?
Not really safe, but...
You've got five hives. How much honey do you get from them?
Average about 40 pound per hive.
40 pound per hive? That's a lot of honey.
Are they great for the allotment? Do they help pollinate the plants?
You should know   you're a gardener!
They do the allotment as much good as they do me with pollinating.
I'll never complain of feeling a bit creaky again!
I've got years of gardening ahead of me!
These grass borders will be allowed to gradually decline
across the winter.
I shan't cut them back.
That's partly because they look lovely as they fade away.
one of the best things in winter but also because it gives good cover
for insects, small mammals and birds.
Also because we encourage them in.
I feed them all winter.
If you're going to feed birds, remember one thing.
Once you start to put the food out, you've got to continue
right through to spring, otherwise they fly in,
use a lot of energy, there's nothing there for them
and that can't be replaced.
That's it for this year.
I'll see you back here next spring.
