It's fine, you can't see anything. Hello, and will come to your Friday
One Show with Alex Jones. And Chris Evans. It is D Day for Team
Rickshaw. Shortly we will see how our six rickshaw riders hope   
coped with the hills of north Wales. We will also be hearing about some
of your heroes, with the help of the buglers from the Royal Marines.
First, a man who has been lucky enough to meet many of his own
personal heroes. And they have been lucky enough to meet him. Sir
Michael Parkinson. Good evening, Michael. How are you? Here he is.
Nice to see you, Michael. You have obviously interviewed the greats.
You are skating on thin ice! You have interviewed all of the greats,
but there is a glaring exception. You have not interviewed yourself,
so throughout the show tonight, we have some questions that you have
asked other people, and we would like you to answer them. Are there
any that I asked mega Ryan? No, we lingered on her for a while. The
first one is from 1973, interviewing Ingrid Bergman. What
is your answer to your question? wonder if you have ever thought
about that period in your life when you were so immensely popular and
wondered what it was that made you so popular. What was it that made
you so popular? Of I really am baffled. It is not easy. Except
when you're a beauty and an actress, it must be easier to answer. There
must have been a tipping point when you realise you were at the
vanguard of what you do for a living. I have always been grateful
to be paid to do a job that I love and enjoy it. Who would not enjoy
meeting Ingrid Bergman. I fell in love with her in Casablanca when I
was about eight, and the thought that I would one day sit next to
her and actually flirt with her... Always take advantage. Do you have
flirting techniques? Editor of touching knees. You were a big one
for touching the is. I get told on Twitter that I am sitting far too
close to you. It is comforting. your wife ever give you grief about
flirting? Not at all. She is not the jealous type. She is trying to
get rid of me! Day one has finally arrived for the One Show's Team
Rickshaw and their Children In Need challenge 2012. Lauren, Chiara,
James, Darren, Camilla and Jack    Jamila and Jack set off this
morning on the first leg of their 411 mile journey to London. It is
not an understatement to say that it has already been hell. Here is
At the crack of dawn, Team Rickshaw were ready to set off on their
marathon 411 mile journey from North Wales to London. Looking
forward to it. It is exciting. The challenge starts today. See you
later. Goodbye. It was James from Kent who was first on the pedals.
Before you know it, it will be one mile down and only 410 miles to go.
Do you know the way? The plan was for them to cycles 51 Prince five
miles from land a note to Dolgellau. The    from Llandudno to Dolgellau.
At the first corner, we got a fiver. It is all for you. Already feeling
the heat, James attempted to cool down. But then, luckily, a downhill
stretch. Look at this. This is a beauty. Lots of people, a lot of
support, which is nice. Didn't surprise you? How nice is it when
people go past and took their horn. It is nice to know they are there.
At the first changeover, Jamila was away, but it became an uphill
struggle. It is a bit hard. Try to relax and just keep going. There is
a bit of pain in my right knee. It is sort of in my joint. She was in
trouble but persisted in completing her leg of the round. Pedal to me.
Yes! We are at the top. You have done it. Superb. Seem rickshaw. Are
we ready for this? Here we go. He is off. Cieron, who suffers from
cerebral palsy, surprised everyone by going a fastest. I am surprised
at the pace. Am I going too fast? Because of Darren Dods no
difficulty with his sight, I am in front with this high visibility
jacket so that he can see me. fluorescent Pudsey in front of me.
But then the rain and the wind set in, but they did not deter Lauren
in any way. I am trying to get some pace going. They are cheering for
you. Everything is amazing, just being with the team. Despite the
weather, Jack battled on, with James returning to cycle in what
was soon apparent were worsening conditions. This is so unfair. The
weather is just ridiculous. The wind in his face, the rain is
coming down. But you know what, he has done it. If you want to show
your support, you don't even have to get on a bike. Although you have
to do is to text. There was real rain and wind. Please text. We will
go live to see them cross the finish line later. They have
arrived, which is good. This is the latest progress report.
We have been travelling at an average pace of about 4.5 mph. We
have 15 miles to go and exactly three hours to do it in, so you can
work out for yourselves how tight this is going to be if we want to
get there for 7 o'clock. But Team Rickshaw are digging deep and we
will do everything we can to get there. Come on, Jamila.
We have blown that because we have already said they had arrived.
know! I got the script for the wrong way round. It happens.

your donations so that others can benefit from Children in Need Choir
like they have in the past. Let's see the total you have raised so
More of that to come. Brilliant. Thank you so much for your
donations. Let's try and get over the quarter million mark tonight.
Would you mind telling the viewers how to donate? To show your

That is all we have time for tonight... Not really. Michael, you
are back with another interview show. Did you ask them? They asked
me. They wanted an interview show. I have wanted for a long time to do
something called Masterclass, with people who are very good at what
they do. Oscar Peterson was on my show in 19 some degree, a jazz
pianist. There was a break in transmission and I sat down next to
him and he started playing a piano, and 20 minutes later I had the most
wonderful exposition, playing and talking about what piano jazz was
about. I came off and I said, one day I will do a show called
Masterclass, talking to people like him, who are maybe the best at what
they do, talking and demonstrating why they are so good. It takes its
time, it is a gentle programme, one hour. Exactly, so we can explore a
Jamie Cullum playing piano, as well as talking to him. I can explore a
portrait painter painting me and talking at the same time. We do a
similar job, portrait painters and me. And also, a couple of people I
have interviewed, like Carlos Acosta, the great Cuban Ballet
dancer and Lang Lang, the Chinese pianist, they have come from the
kind of background, the kind of poverty that we cannot even imagine
in this country. So they are inspiring stories. There was a
great story Carlos Acosta told you about the food that he used to eat.
He said basically he came home one day and he had a sniff and said,
What is that wonderful smell? And she said, have cooked your pet
rabbit. It has become folklore. I was Philip Schofield, I would
tweet a picture now. This is on Sky Arts. On Tuesday, a brand new
series. You have so many varied guests on the show, what was the
criteria when putting the list together? People who are very good
at what they do and who might be able to demonstrate. Carlos Acosta
dancers on the show. He is like a beautiful animal, extraordinary,
the fitness. Lang Lang and Jamie Cullum playing piano. And also, I
did somebody I have known for a long time, Don McCullen, a war
photographer. Having covered wars myself and being very frightened
when I have done it, I have all of a sudden    I have always admired
those people who choose to go to war. But when you look at the
images that he has taken, and you think of the time he spent getting
that picture and the risk he took, you begin to imagine what kind of
life he must have, the memories that haunt him and live with him.
It is a kind of powerful piece, that. It really is. But overall
what it does, it actually shows to young people watching, to anybody
watching, that there is no easy way to success and greatness. No matter
how talented you are, you have to work hard. Nowadays, a lot of young
people are persuaded by television particularly that the way to the
golden pot is by walking up the back of the stairs on a TV reality
show and coming down the other side, and they have made it. It is not
like that at all. I think they are realising that now. It has taken a
few years. Parkinson: Masterclass starts on Tuesday at 9pm on Sky
Arts. Time for another question to Parkinson from Parkinson. This one
is you from 1970 for asking questions to David Frost. What is
your answer to the question? What are the areas that you would care
not to be asked about? Straight on to that. Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.
Would that be it? I don't like talking about myself, basically.
noticed that on the first question. I get slightly embarrassed by it. I
am better at asking questions. will take any tips this evening.
Every year, up an army of volunteers give away thousands of
books to try to get people to fall in love with literature, and from
today you can put your name down to be one of those. We asked Angellica
Edinburgh, UNESCO City of Literature. And for one day only,
home to me. I am here to launch World Book Night 2013. They need
20,000 volunteers to give away half a million books. There are 20
titles on this year's list, and I have 100 books to give away. I
think I will need some help. Who better than a man who has written
extensively about Edinburgh, Alexander McCall Smith? Alexander
is also the author of the number  one Ladies' Detective Agency, a
series of books that have been translated into 46 languages and
made into a TV series. What was taken? Sure news. Three issues?
Alexander, tell us what World Book Night is about. It is a wonderful
occasion in which a lot of people give away a great many books.
The general idea is to focus on people who otherwise may not have
many books in their lives, but who would appreciate them. Reading is
tremendously important, because it encourages the growth of moral
imagination. It enlivens the world. Good morning. We have a book for
you. Philippa Gregory is a novelist. It is a free book. "my father had a
face that could stop a clock". don't you like reading? It is
boring. Here is a book that I wrote. Listen to the first sentence. "she
had a detective agency in Africa". Are you gripped?
This is the lady with pearl earrings. Are you selling lots of
April earrings? Let me read. Only my mother would know from the
tightening of my jaw on the widening of my eyes. How is that
for a beginning? Every day at 1 o'clock precisely, a cannon is
fired from Edinburgh Castle. It has been going since 1861, and Ali is
the first woman ever to hold the post. Since you are a serving
soldier, we have a book here from Andy McNabb. I have read a lot of
his books and I enjoyed them. I know many people Mike Sergeant
Mackenzie. One of the reasons for World Book Night is the getting
literature into communities with little access to it. My last trip
is to meet Kevin and Gary, part of the city's homeless community. How
do you feel when you read? I just get engrossed. It is escapism.
do you think would be good? don't you take three? A little
birdie tells me that you love reading. By do, yes. I have read a
lot of Jackie Collins' books. how about Ian Fleming? James Bond.
If you want to get your hands on some three books to give out in
your community, log on to The One Show website for all the
information on how to volunteer for World Book Night 2013.
We have all got more books than we need it. Do you have a library,
Michael? I sense you have a library at home. He has got a library!
was reared on books. DVD libraries are a feature in people's lives now.
And you have a new DVD out? I do indeed. It is the people who have
been on the show at most times, like Spike Milligan. We have picked
20 people who were a constant on the show. We have given them 20
minutes each. Let's get on to more of those questions. The last
question from Michael to Michael. This is one You asked Michael Caine
in 2003. Are you are older and wiser? Blew the two go together?
I could talk at length about this. Yes, I am older and sillier. I must
be daft to keep working at my age. Do you feel wiser? Yes. I feel a
lot more certain in many areas. I was always very shy, which sounds
strange to say. For the first five years of doing the talk show, I
could barely walk down the stairs. I would have liked to have walked
down backwards. But I have grown into myself through doing
television and getting used to being in public. It is not a wise
thing, but a satisfying thing. have accepted yourself. E is in
your own skin. Parky's Picks, the DVD, is out on 26th November.
And now, let's go to Matt in Dolgellau. How are you? Yes, we are
here. We made it, and that is the main thing. What an incredible day
we have had. There are so many stories. It has been a phenomenal
effort from all of Team Rickshaw! We are going to have a chat with
Jamila first. You don't spend an enormous time in the countryside,
do you? No, I don't. I live in London, so you don't get much
country said. Talk me through those views from the top. You didn't see
much of them? No. I was at the top of a hill, and I don't like heights,
so it was frightening. You did incredibly well. We were lagging
behind a bit earlier, until the rickshaw rocket known as Jack comes
on board. He was clocked going down a hill from 1200 ft above sea level
and 27 miles an hour! How did you manage that? I have no idea. It was
that sheer rush of adrenalin. Just stick my head down, get going.
Talking of pushing to the end, from the beginning, it was the story of
James. We have to give him a cheer, because he is coming up the hill
now. This lad has just blown everybody away. His sheer
determination. He set off first thing this morning. Going up the
Crimean pass was something that even took me by surprise. It was
unbelievable. How does it feel? is pretty good. It is nice to have
all the support. You got up that Crimean pass. What technique did
you use? I just thought, keep moving. Keep my legs pedalling. I
just set myself little targets. I will get there, then I will get
there. Kept going up. It was mightily impressive. Jamila, have
you got the present Andy? You are going to love this, James. You have
to wear it all tomorrow. Team Rickshaw! Gather round, because
this is what is happening tomorrow. Because you three have done
brilliantly, you will have a lie in. First on the ritual tomorrow is
Cieron. Then it is Lauren. Pleased with that? Yeah. Finally, Darren,
you will do two hours tomorrow. This is the route. It is 58 miles
on Saturday. Sunday is 53 miles, and Monday, 51 miles. How many did
we did today? Today you did 52. That is it from Dolgellau. Tomorrow,
we are heading to Lamberto! De One Show will be coming live
from the route next week. As well as Cardiff Castle on Monday, if you
can get to Milsom Street in Bath on Tuesday, Salisbury Martyr Square on
Wednesday and the Oracle shopping centre in Reading on Thursday,
please get down there. Details of on the web site. If you do come
along and take photos anywhere along the ridge, send them in to us.
This Sunday is of course Remembrance Day, and after the
country has observed the two minute silence, the Royal Marines will
play The Last Post. Joe Crowley has unearthed the
history behind this haunting tune, When you hear The Last Post, that
moment of the first note, you begin to summon all the souls back to the
Cenotaph, and we feel all of their deeds and we honour them at one
moment. You think of all the lads that have been before, and a
I have come here to the Royal Military School of Music, where the
British Army trained their musicians to find out more about
the origins of this amusing    moving memorial and the role it
played in the history of the armed forces. It comes from a series of
calls that signify different points in the daytime in camp, so soldiers
knew what to do throughout the day. It started off with the valley, we
got out of bed, and finished with The Last Post. Before people had
watches, it formatted their day. At the end of the day, the officer
would do with the first post. He would go round them all, and by the
time he got to The Last Post, that was when The Last Post would be
sounded. It meant nothing else would happened that night. There
are records of pupils being played at military funerals in the 1880s
to signify the end of a life. It is believed that The Last Post was
played for the first time at the Cenotaph in 1920, at the internment
of the Unknown soldier. Maurice Green's grandfather Daniel played
bugle in the army, and served in the eighth Battalion York and
Lancaster Regiment. My grandfather got killed on the first day of the
Battle of the Somme, 1916. 703 men went over, 68 came back. While
searching for military memorabilia in a local market, Maurice found
something that brought him much closer to his grandfather. At a
stall in Rotherham, they sold army badges and metals, stuff like that.
There was this old pupil, and I reached over and pick it up. And
immediately, I felt queer. So you took this bugle home and started
cleaning it up. What did you discover? I saw what I thought were
my grandfather's first degree army numbers. Lo and behold, that number
was on my grandad's medals. When you matched those up, how did that
feel? Like a miracle. I feel as though I want to cry a bit. The
bugle has been found, but he hasn't. No other piece of music means so
much to so many people, and carries with it such emotional significance.
When those notes punctuate the air, it really makes the hairs on the
back of the neck stand. And when it is played, it means we can never
forget those, like Maurice's grandfather, who have given their

Earlier in the week, we asked for your family's war heroes, and we
had an amazing response. Here are a few of the thousands we received.
All of them poignant, all touching. We have highlighted three lovely

than a duffel coat and a balaclava. Hats off to all those guys and
girls. Remember a Remembrance Day this weekend. Thanks to Michael
