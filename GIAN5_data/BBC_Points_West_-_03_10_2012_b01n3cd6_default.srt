Good evening and welcome to Points West. Our headline tonight...
The search for answers   the family of Garrett Elsey remain hopeful
that new test results will show how the student died.
Preparing for the next band of heavy rain   the communities
bracing themselves for more flooding.
Another cut in funding   the Gloucestershire homeless project
facing the threat of closure. And a family funeral for a World
War II soldier who lay unknown in a Good evening.
The family of a student who was found dead at a recycling depot on
the outskirts of Bristol say they still don't know how he died.
Garrett Elsey had flown into the UK from Canada to study at the
University. It is thought he may have fallen
asleep inside a large waste bin and then been crushed inside a rubbish
lorry. But his uncle told Canadian television that the post mortem
examination showed no signs of any broken bones. Andrew Plant has more.
Garrett Elsey had just graduated from university in Canada. He had
flown 4,000 miles to the UK to study further, taking a MSc in
International Security. But Garrett's dream lasted just 24
to the city he was planning to call home. Just one day into his time
here, his body was found at a waste dump on the outskirts of the city.
Police say his death isn't suspicious, but it is still a
mystery   still with more questions than answers. Do in way nor that
Garrett Elsey registered for his course at Bristol University on
Wednesday after ring, a big ago today. He went to his rented
accommodation end of the city centre, and there he taxed warm to
say that all was well.    text at home. On Wednesday evening he met a
friend from Canada also in the city. It is thought they went out to
local boroughs. Garrett Elsey's body was found at a waste dump in
Avonmouth next morning around 10:20am. Police closed several
sites across the city until they pinpointed where the bin had been
collected from. They traced it to hear, collecting student rubbish
that his new hall of residence. It is still not clear how Garrett
Elsey came to be inside the den, although one theory is he climbed
inside himself looking to lie down, perhaps disorientated by a life in
a new city. In an interview for Canadian TV, Garrett Elsey's uncles
said his shoes and glasses had been found nearby. It is thought he
removed them himself. Police saw him on a security camera
near his student residence where he was staying. They see him at one
point where he should turn left to get to his residence, but he turns
right, and basically that is where he got lost.
Core post mortem results have not shown    post mortem results have
not shown conclusively how Garrett Elsey died. A memorial service is
being held in his home town of If you've been out and about today,
chances are you'll have got more than a bit wet. There have been dry
spells and sunshine in some areas, but for most of us it's been very
wet   and the bad news is there is more to come. In fact, forecasters
are predicting severe downpours as the week goes on, which is really
bad news for areas hit hard by flooding in recent weeks. Laura
Jones has been finding out what is Preparing for the worst. John and
Steve help look after the streets of Bristol all year long   but in
Autumn, their job becomes more important than ever.
The leaves start falling down, as you can see. It blocks the top of

your job is to make sure they stay clear?
Away from the city, the process of draining excess rainwater is more
complicated. This is a village in north Somerset, last week parts of
that were badly flooded but today it looked very tranquil. But this
is not local pond, it should be a field. When it rains heavily, it is
not unusual to see fields like this underwater. It is normally absorbed
by the ground or drains of ditty quickly. The problem at the moment
is that ground this sodden with rivers this full, there is nowhere
for the water de Gaulle. Of course, rain is not unusual in autumn, but
the mid  forecasters are predicting further next few days is.    the
amount forecasters. It is all being caused by the tail end of hurricane
Nadine, which is still swirling around in the Atlantic. How bad it
will get remains to be seen. But already various events including
Saturday's Party In The Park in Weston super Mare have been
cancelled. And, unless you too are a keen fisherman with a decent
umbrella, you might want to try and stay indoors where possible.
Labour are stepping up their campaign to win Bristol's first 
ever mayoral election. The party's candidate. Martin Rees, took centre
stage at their conference in Manchester today. He made a speech,
and was then praised by party leader Ed Miliband. With me is our
political editor, Paul Barltrop. The Bristol contest must be pretty
important for Labour. Absolutely, across the entire
south western this is the one we are aiming for, because there are
police elections everywhere, so Marvin Rees is getting a very high 
profile indeed. He will have lots of big visits to Bristol, probably
the party leader coming down in days to come, not least because
they are at a low lead in the region. They controlled councils,
they have a couple of MPs, so they told that victory in Bristol will
kick start a revival in the region. This is what the backing of a big
political party get used   a high profile, carefully choreographed
appearance. Bristol is a fantastic city, and if
I can tempt you to bring a future Labour Party conference there, you
will be able to see it for yourselves. But, like Britain, we
could go better. His speech was brief. He was the warm up act for
the party leader coming to do a question and answer session, but
not before praising his candidate. Let's hear it for the fantastic
Marvin Rees, who will be a great Mayor of Bristol. They have much
ground to make up. Watching back in Bristol, a Labour veteran who
remembers that the good days. Graham Robertson was a councillor
for four decade. They were mostly good times. We ran the city council
all the years I was on the city council. The Conservatives had a
very small number of people compared with ourselves. We ran
everything. He was leader for 13 years and thinks November's vote is
crucial. I think it is very important. If they don't win this
election, frankly it will be a long time before we get back into
control again. It is all very well getting a good reception in the
conference hall, but where Labour needs to make an impact is in
places like your. This is Bristol's Southmead estate, traditionally
strong for Labour. At the last general election it got a
Conservative MP. Among voters today, apathy and some antipathy. I am not
really interested. We don't need a Mayor. I don't agree with that, a
waste of money, I think. I will vote, but I am not sure who four.
will vote for Labour, is that boring? I will not vote because I
don't think we need one. Candidates have six weeks left to
persuade people to vote. Sick weeks to persuade people to
vote, but we don't know how many candidates there will be? Will,
nominations will start next week, but we won't get a finalist until
the 24th. After that, the council will put around a booklet
explaining who the candidates are. We will get an idea then, and also
find out whether there are 12 or more, which is is speculated there
will be. For more information on that, and on the Police
Commissioner elections, which will affect everyone on November 15th,
quoted the BBC News website. And stay with us, because we will
be across it all the way. Milk farmers from across the west have
been at the Bath and West show ground in Somerset today for the
annual Dairy Show. Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the
big topics of conversation is the badger cull and the RSPCA's plans
to encourage badger friendly labels on dairy products in the
supermarket. Earlier this week, the RSPCA told Points West it wants
people to know where milk has come Consumers with a conscience it
should be able to buy milk in areas where badgers have not been
slaughtered. Farmers, too, have a choice. Mastitis and lameness is a
far Bilic    bigger killer of cattle than bovine TB. The answer
is vaccination and cure. So, how has that gone down with the
farmers? Ali Vowles has been gauging opinions.
Every farmer likes a show   a chance to show off their prize cows
and chew the cud over agricultural issues. Being from farming stock
myself, I know farmers like to talk. A lot.
At today's Dairy Show, along with milk quotas and the rising price of
winter feed, it was the badger cull that was dominating conversations.
In recent weeks Natural England has issued a licence to cull the animal
in West Gloucestershire   one for West Somerset is expected soon.
Many farmers say the cull will stop the spread of bovine TB carried by
badgers. Those against say consumers should boycott milk from
the farms involved, a view I would ask the RSPCA to try and do
the job we're doing. While closed down with tea be now. What is the
difference between echo's wife and a badger's life.
The doctors of the RSPCA, you would think they would do their best to
sort it out and not take sides. is costing the industry a lot of
money, so if they do this cull and it works, so much the better.
Even within the farming community, there is divided opinion, with many
hoping a suitable vaccine can be developed as soon as possible. Not
every farmer is for the cull. Most just want badger numbers to be
humanely controlled to help stop the spread.
I don't think it is right, my dear. I don't think they've got enough
evidence. Do you? One of the worrying things I
learned today is that some farmers are being intimidated. I have been
talking to some in the cull areas in wit    Gloucestershire and West
Somerset. It they will not appear on camera, but they told me some
have received threatening letters and one farmer told me his wife has
been ostracised in the playground, the other parents not talking to
her. Everyone has a right to protest, but to take action like
that when a farmer is trying to protect his own business is
probably rather unfair on the farmers. I don't think there is a
farm or in this world who wants to kill think took    badgers. E coli,
I don't think there is anyone in this world wants to see sick
badgers.    equally.
If anyone doubts the farmers respect of their animals, look at
this. Today's photo stand was doing a booming trade. The issue of
bovine TB is not black and white. But with the cull due to start soon,
everyone is wary of the You're watching Wednesday's Points
West. Ian is here with news of more rain a bit later in the programme.
But before that... About to land the biggest deal in
aircraft history, but what will the proposed merger mean for thousands
of workers here in the West? And will it be Cheltenham Town or
Bristol Rovers picking up the The homeless charity Shelter has
confirmed it is planning to close its office in Gloucester. The
centre offered advice for people sleeping rough but is having to
close because funding has been cut. It is one of a number of projects
in the city which supports the homeless. But are they in demand?
Our Gloucestershire reporter, Steve Another busy day for the GEAR
Projects. I met Julian, who has been homeless since 17. He has just
finished his latest spell in prison for shoplifting to fund a drug
habit. He blames no one but himself, but says he is on the brink of
doing something about it. Dead is a vicious circle. I just
want to brake that cycle and go home. Not necessarily where I'm
from, idle double what going home is. You must have a wife, you go
home, you have a family, something there, someone who loves you,
unconditional. I want some of that. That is what I want, but am not
going to get it through drugs or being an idiot.
GEAR work with the homeless to help them get clean, find housing and
ultimately a job. For many it's also life saving.
I would possibly be dead, possibly dying of pneumonia, because I was
slipping out of rough, possibly back in prison. I certainly would
not have my own a little flat, somewhere I can come for support,
get a coffee... Projects like this would rather not
have to exist, but there is a demand that the chief executive
says hasn't gone away. There have been many different
initiatives aimed at reducing homelessness, and the problem keeps
getting worse. Something different needs to happen, because nothing
changes if things remain the same. Talk to people here and there is a
common theme. They all want to live and contribute to society, and many
have that moment that tipped the balance.
A little girl came up to me and said, I have    I am going to buy
you some food, and she bought me a burka, and she could not have been
more than five years old. I composed myself, I went round the
corner and bowled my eyes out. may take some time to get there

If it happens, it will be the biggest merger in the history of
aircraft, and they've got just a week to get it together. EADS   the
parent company of Airbus and BAE Systems   employ around 6,000
people here in the West, and it is fair to say their plans have caused
quite a storm. Here is our business They were testing landing gear at
Filton this morning for a plane that has yet to fly. State of the
art equipment for the next generation of passenger jets.
Be in civilian a, the Europeans already beat the Americans. Last
year, Airbus sold more passenger jet than bowling, but bowling is
still at a bigger company. By? Because the American    Americans
make military did. Which is why the Airbus mother ship, EADS, has been
eyeing up BAE Systems, makers of the Typhoon and countless other
fast jets and warships. De Has been trying hard in
Europe. I think by tying up with BAE Systems, it power in the US
would be significantly enhanced. It would help to get it, big time come
into the US market. But this week, the wheels have started to come off
the deal. Governments have been rowing,
investors arguing over the value of their new shares, MPs announcing an
inquiry into national security. The engineering is incredibly
complicated, and a financial wheeling and dealing is mind 
boggling. But try and imagine these two companies like a courting
couple trying to get together, and then the problems start to make
sense. They like each other, but can the parents get along?
For EADS that means France and Germany. There are fighting over
where the new HQ will be. That has not gone down well with the end was
in London. BAE Systems is floated on the London Stock Exchange, but
Number Ten has a golden share, giving the Prime Minister the final
say. The bosses have been on a charm offensive. It is not like
we're desperate to do it, but it is a great opportunity for both
companies and for the workforce. This is a big deal and raises big
issues for governments, for states, defence, sovereignty, so we have
three governments, two companies, lots of MPs in the UK, lots of
issues, but I think it will happen. The balance of probability is in
favour of the deal. As I left Filton, they were
building   a new $70 million office block for 3,000 wing designers and
engineers. There have been many names over the
door here down the years   Bristol Aeroplane Company, British
Aerospace, Airbus. By the time this building is up, Filton's flying
factory may have another. The remains of a teenage soldier
who was killed in action while fighting with the Wiltshire
Regiment have been buried in a moving ceremony in The Netherlands
today. In 1944, Private Lewis Curtis died in an artillery attack
after a failed operation to secure the bridge at Arnhem. Louise
Hubball joined family members at Private Lewis Curtis was a Cornish
boy a serving in a Wiltshire Regiment who died in a foreign land.
This is a world the 19 year old left behind   Holland, ravaged by
the Second World War. He was killed during an Allied push towards
Arnhem. It was the fiercest fighting the Wiltshire Regiment
adenosine. This Dutch memorial is dedicated to the men who fell from
the Wiltshires. For almost 70 years, private Lewis Curtis Lee in an
unmarked grave. The Dutch army identified his body through dental
records, and today private quarters was buried with full military
honours in front of a Cornish family finally able to say goodbye.
Very moving, and... Quite overwhelming. With all the effort
that has been made by every body that has attended, to the War

killed, private Luis gritters has finally been laid to rest

It's the first West Country derby of the football season tonight, as
Bristol Rovers take on Cheltenham. While Rovers have home advantage,
Cheltenham have made a much better start in the league. Ali Durden is
at the Memorial Stadium   so who's I think the two things balance
themselves out to a degree. Rovers finally got their first win of the
season at the weekend, but as you say, Cheltenham   last season's
playoff runners up   are again looking promising. They have won
two of their last three games, and if they do so again tonight they
will move up to fifth in the table. Rovers, by contrast, have found it
tough going, scoring just six goals so far, and tonight are looking for
provide their fans with a first I think we have put Saturday behind
us, we have taken enjoyment rid of that and relief. There was no
denying that, it was a relief. But we now have a difficult game
against Cheltenham who are doing really well this season, and we
have to take up that challenge. are probably in a better position
than last year, but there is also on expectation that things are just
going to happen this year. We have de Gaulle and earn it again, and
Bristol Rovers are a big football club in a our division. You can
just go there and win, you have it earned it. That is exactly what we
will do tomorrow night. By it was one win each last season,
but who will have the bragging rights, and more importantly he
will have the points tonight? BBC Bristol and BBC Radio
Gloucestershire will have the answer for you.
Did you see the surprising thing about his report? It wasn't
raining! That makes a change. That is
probably all about to change, as Ian can tell us. It woke me up last
night. night.
Pretty heavy downpours, including this afternoon for many districts.
On a positive note, the bulk of tomorrow will be decent, just a few
showers, most staying dry. But it is a different story it towards
late evening and overnight into Friday morning. We still have a Met
Office early warning boat from midnight into the start of Friday
through to the Early Saturday. Around 20 40 mm expected, and we
could see 60 18 mm over higher ground. Let me run through what is
happening at the moment. Some showers clearing around parts of
Wiltshire and Gloucestershire at the moment, some particularly heavy,
including over Somerset. More through the Bristol Channel
tomorrow, after that dry weather. Then this feature runs in on this
front, late tomorrow evening, and the brighter colours denoting heavy
rainfall across the West Country into the early hours of Friday
morning. For the rest of this evening, we have had some lightning,
some hailstones, and still some showers likely to come in through
the Bristol Channel in two parts of North and Central Somerset. Either
side of that, broadly speaking dry, clear whether developing. It will
turn quite chilly away from the cause, temperatures into single
figures, may be as low as five or six Celsius in the Cotswolds.
Tomorrow morning, some showers in this familiar territory of Somerset.
That aside, the rest of the day will have a good deal of sunshine,
some scattered showers through the day, but they will be rare, most
districts will be dry. Towards late evening, patchy rain into the west
of Somerset, then quite quickly it sprints through into the early
hours of Friday. Heavy rain here which could bring high
tomorrow up to 15 Celsius, and it should feel decent enough. Towards
the weekend, Friday their heavy rain well clear in the morning,
then patchy, light rain and drizzle. Saturday looks like a decent day
under a temporary ridge of high pressure. Sunday could be another
raft of problems, some heavy, disruptive rain later through
Sunday into Monday. A lot of uncertainty, but we could have a
double whammy of the heavy rainfall. The we're talking about rainfall
