13 mintoits ten on this Saturday, 10th December, we're live at
lottery HQ and your host, the lovely, Myleene Klass. Good evening,
welcome along to a very exciting show. Good things come in threes.
guests joining us later, Joey Essex, Lydia Bright and James 'Arg' Argent
will be here. I kid you not. We haven't had so much fake tan in the
building since Dale Winton was presenting. Hush your mouth. Dale
is a living legend. I know. It's time to get the first of the
evening under way. Cross those fingers. Here comes Thunderball.
What, Alan, have you ever fake tanned? I thought as much. Get that
first machine turning Matt, Matt Chamberlain is the draw master.
Sian Fleet Milne is our independent adjudicator.
Last night there were 112,000 winning Thunderball tickets. Are we
ready to start the Thunderball? we are. We're off. Which of these
is going to be the first to appear tonight? The answer is 14. Three
opportunities per week to play this game, Wednesdays, Fridays and
Saturdays. Next up tonight, that one there, 20. The third is 30.
Even a prize for matching just the thinneder ball itself remember.   
Thunderball itself remember. Next up, one is selected, 24. The final
ball from this, our first machine, is seven. Release the 14 thunder
balls now. If you've matched with all five numbers so far, you can
look forward to �5,000, but if you can also match the Thunderball,
instead of �5,000, you'll be looking at �500,000. Put simply,
the next ball to roll out could leave you rolling in it. Best of
luck. Here we go. This is the number that
could make a big doifrpbs what you win tonight. It's number six. Here
are tonight's Thunderball numbers again in ascending order: Our guest
over the TV screens, win ago wards and changing the way we speak.
They're after the Christmas number one spot. Here are Joey, Lydia and
Arg from The Only Way Is Essex. Arg, tell us, what is TOWIE? TOWIE is
basically about a group of young individuals. We've all been friends
for years. We go out, have fun, it follows our everyday lives work
wise, relationships and family. the inside gossip. You say young,
but don't forget Nanny Pat! Young at heart. Can't forget her. You say
it's reality, but what about all the other things that go on, where
you show this scene, or you going down the red carpet. We try to keep
it, I think people liked the show because they liked the glitz and
glamour how we live our Essex lives. Now we have the perks of going to
the red carpets and things like that, when we're at home, we do our
normal things, like go to our shops and in our groups of friends and
partying. Kind of reality! OK. It's changing a bit. What about the
phrases you've come out with. Joey you came up with reem. Yes it's a
word I made up. I mean it is an 80s word. It means extremely reem,
everything's good, the best. Reem was already in the 80s. I brought
it back into fashion pretty much. You have that power. What about
well jel. We try to shorten our words so it's short for well jelous.
So I'm well jel of your outfit. I just want Alan to stop talking.
Shaaaaupp. What about when the cameras stop rolling if you're in
an argument, say, can you walk away from it? It's real life, real
emotions. So if they were to su "cut" you still have the same
feelings. You would either walk off set, storm off. So it's real, kind
of. We would flow with the argument really. If you had a few too many
drinks it carries on for a while after. Then people try to split us
apartment Real drama Christmas is busy because you have a single out.
We do. I'm a little bit disappointed. I wanted it to be
called I dreamed a reem. Or what about well jel bells. What is it
called? We're doing Wham's rendition of Last Christmas.
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy I keep my distance, but you still
catch my eye Tell me baby, do you recognise me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
I wrapped it up and sent it With a note saying "I love you, I
meant it "now I know what a fool I've been
If you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart, but the very next day, you
gave it away... Our own little podium party here.
Are these the moves? What is this? I don't know. The turn. It's like
cleaning the windows. That's out on the 18th Last Christmas. All the
proceeds going to charity. Very nice. Be honest, would was the
worst singer? Lydia or Chloe. That's come as a surprise to Lydia.
I thought I was quite good. would be a good background dancer
not so much singer. We saw Mark in the jungle. Are you back as Marge?
I sung at his welcome home party. You're running with the singing
thing now. I'm plugging myself, aren't I? Thank you for joining us,
good luck with the single 18th December. They're answering more
questions back stage after show. Head online and follow the links if
you want to see that, and maybe the dance moves. That's optional. We
it's going to be the big. But how big is the jackpot tonight, Alan?
Huge. The rollover jackpot is estimated at �15 million. Very nice.
If you won that you'd instantly be richer than Cheryl Cole, not bad.
That's a lot of shoes. Let's do this. Take it away. Release the
Lancelot and set of balls number six. Congratulations if you were a
mid week winner. Well done you. Matt, are we ready? Indeed. Guys
over to you. Good luck everyone. Good luck guys. There's the first

each week. Next, number 21. Joined us 22 Saturdays back. 224th time
