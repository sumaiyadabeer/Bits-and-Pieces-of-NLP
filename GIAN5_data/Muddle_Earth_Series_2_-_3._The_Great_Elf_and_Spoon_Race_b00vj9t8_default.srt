Come to a world of great wonder and merriment
Borne out of magic, its name, Muddle Earth
A wizard called Randalf and Newt, his apprentice
Defend it from evil for all that they're worth
An evil blue teddy bear called Dr Cuddles
Is constantly trying to take over this land
  The Horned Baron pays up
  And Randalf is made up
And somehow it always works out in the end
Muddle Earth is a magic kingdom
Muddle Earth, full of monsters and mayhem and more.
Oh, yay. Oh, yay. Hear this...
Welcome to the 350th Great Elf and Spoon Race.
Rules as usual. Once around Muddle Earth.
First to cross the finish line wins...
Drum roll, please.
  ..the Golden Spoon!
Ooh!
What are you going to do with a spoon as big as that?
Throw a giants' tea party?
The Golden Spoon? Sounds like a worthwhile quest!
Oh, how little you know!
It's highly overrated and extremely tacky!
All that gold!
It must be worth a fortune!
A fortune, you say?
If we won, we could sell it and pay off our debts.
Pay off our debts? Well then...
But what are we going to race with?
You could use your powers to conjure up some mode of transport.
I suppose a little dabbling in the magical arts...
Oh, does he have to?
Soon...the Golden Spoon shall be mine!
And then you'll have your just desserts.
Hm? Oh, yes, very droll.
What no one knows is, the spoon is not any old solid gold spoon.
In its reflection, you will see a vision of the future.
If I win the race, I can bend that spoon to my evil schemes!
That's why we are going to destroy the Baron's hope with this rope.
That's it! Those are the rules.
No gouging, no coughing, no kicking and no kissing!
Good luck, and may the best Horned Baro...er, may the best citizen win!
Benson, remind me of our plan.
Oh, yes. Our plan.
We cheat as much as possible, and...
no, that's it. We cheat as much as possible.
  I like it!
  Then you present yourself with the spoon.
  Brilliant!
That should get the wife off my back for a while.
  I heard that!
  Ooh.
Room for one more?
Remind me. Your spell was for a big carpet.
It might be small, but it can fly like the wind!
  Right, Randalf?
  Er... yes. Like the wind.
Right, then. Here goes.
Ready for liftoff!
Ahh!
Hey!
No o orbe e e ert!
Get after them! We've got a race to win!
Splice the side bits.
We'll make the baron fashionably late.
Curse Grubley and Smink!
They're blocking me with bloomers!
Allow me, sir. Ahem.
Is that right, sir?
The baroness has cash for clobber but nowhere to spend it?
Did you just hear the words "baroness", "cash" and "clobber"?
  Excellent fib, Benson!
  Thank you.
Oh, dear. I'm really sorry!
Looks like we've got them just where we want them.
Assuming we want them to finish ahead of us, that is!
Never fear, Veronica! We're going to win!
  Right, Newt?
  Right, Randalf!
Are we there yet?
Yes.
Now, take the shortcut to the woods. You know what to do.
Randalf and his friends are catching, my Lord.
Keep going, Norbert! No ranging river or fearsome forest could stop us!
Raging river, fearsome forest. I got it.
Perhaps it's time they stopped for a spot of breakfast.
Oh! Whoa ee!
  Oh, ahh! Whoa!
  Whoa!
It's some sort of porridge.
Oh, yes.
And what's worse, it needs more sugar.
I'm going up top for a better look, Benson!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Er, Benson? Benson!
Come ba a a a ck!
Faster, Benson! Faster!
We're catching them! Let's just hope Norbert doesn't stub his toe!
Ahhh!
Ohh! My toe!
No! We're going to lose!
Fear not! My magic has the answer!
My flying friend, we need help quick  
let me control you with this stick.
Oh, I think I've got something.
Whoa!
Don't panic! I'm in complete control!
Randalf! I prefer not to turn you to toast,
so PLEASE let me go!
Yes, yes, Margot. As soon as I've worked out how to do it!
Can I have a go, Randalf? Please?
Er...well...
I'm really sorry about this, Margot.
Ohh.
All aboard!
Faster, Margot! Faster!
I must have that spoon!
I WILL have the spoon!
Push harder, my little beauties!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!
No! No!
Where's Margot?
Ahh!
Never mind Margot! Look! The finishing line!
Quick!
Over my dead body!
And my dead body, too!
Ahh!
With this spoon, I can see the future!
That's right! With me as the winner!
Let's see.
I'm sorry, that doesn't make any sense at all.
Is that my face or your arm?
Ahhh!
I think we've found Margot.
Which leaves the spoon for us!
Sparkly, glinty, shiny tweasure,
all is here to give me pleasure.
So long, losers!
  Tired.
  Dazed.
  Battered.
  And a long walk back!
Come on, then. Home, sweet home.
