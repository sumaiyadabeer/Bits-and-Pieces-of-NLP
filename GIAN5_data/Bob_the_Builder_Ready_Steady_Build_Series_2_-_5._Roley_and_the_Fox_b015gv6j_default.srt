Here, Roly! Join in!
Wahey! Thanks, Scratchy!
I love being part of Bob's team with all my friends.
Morning, team. We're building a golf course today.
Golf's a game where you try to knock balls into holes.
Like this.
So, come on. Let's go!
Morning, all. Splendid day for a game of golf, eh?
Oh! Fore!
Oh! Um, why did you shout that, Mr Bentley?
Fore means your ball hasn't gone quite where it should have, Lofty.
'Bye now.
OK. Let's look at the plans.
First, we'll dig out three greens.
Those are where the holes are.
Then we'll lay grass on them and rubber matting around them.
Last, we'll build a store cupboard for the clubs and balls.
The course is going to look like a jungle.
We've even got some wild animals made from wood.
We have to work fast so the children can play golf later.
  Can we build it?
  Yes, we can!
Oh, er, yeah, I think so.
  Here are your wild animals, Bob.
  Thanks, Packer.
Why are they called wild, Bob?
They're animals who live away from people, Roly.
  Usually with their friends.
  < Fore!
  Sounds like Mr Bentley's golf isn't going too well.
  A hem!
I can't think where all my balls have gone.
I'll, er, I'll take some more.
Hello, little Foxy.
Oh! You're a wild animal, aren't you?
Like Bob was talking about.
A ha! Ha ha ha ha! You're funny!
But shouldn't you be with your friends?
Oh! Maybe you've lost your friends.
Oh! Don't worry, little Foxy.
I'll be your new friend!
  Oh! You want to play!
Bob to Roly. We've finished laying the first green.
Can you come and roll it flat, please?
Um, I'll be right there, Bob.
Maybe you should look for your friends, Foxy.
But if you can't find them, I'll be at the golf course Bob's building.
Hi, Roly. This seems to be the last bucket of balls.
There were three this morning.
  Oh! Someone'd better look after them.
  Good idea.
Can you do it? Or there'll be none for the children.
Oh! Um, OK, Bob.
Foxy! You came!
Sorry I can't play with you. I have to work.
I know. You miss your friends.
Oh! You're looking at Bob's wooden wild animals!
Come on, I'll show you.
  Ta da!
Oh, no! They've scared you!
No, Foxy! Don't run off!
  Roly? What's happened?
  Oh, Bob!
The wild animals are all muddy! I'm really sorry.
  Don't worry, Roly.
  We'll clean them up later.
  Right now, you need to look after that bucket of balls.
  Yeah!
  There's a fox!
  Yeah. He's lost his friends.
  So I'm being his new friend.
  But it's a wild animal.
Shouldn't you tell Bob?
I'll tell Bob later. I've got to check on the balls.
Phew! They're still here, Foxy.
Fore! >
Oh! A nice new bucket of balls.
Mr Bentley, those balls are for the children.
Don't worry, Roly, I'll only use one or two.
Fore!
Ah! Oh! Fox! Fox! Ooo! Oh!
The balls!
Oh, no! They've all gone!
A fox? Where?
It's my fault, Bob. I thought little Foxy had lost its friends,
so I tried to be its new friend.
But it knocked the animals into the mud and now I've lost the balls!
  Oh, Roly!
  Don't worry. We'll sort it all out.
But first, what are we going to do with you, little Foxy?
Maybe it's just lost. It keeps looking over at the woods.
Oh! So I don't need to be Foxy's new friend,
I need to take him back to his old friends!
It's the right thing to do, Roly.
Oh, Bob! I think it's his mum and dad.
I'm sure he'll never forget you, Roly.
We'd better finish the job before the children arrive.
Yeah. I've got a lot to make up for.
Everything's finished, but there aren't any balls for the children.
  Foxies! You found them all!
Oh, thank you!
Now little Foxy knows where the golf course is,
he can play with you any time.
Yeah! Then he can go back to the wild
and be with his friends and family while I stay here with mine!
Wow! Let's play!
Marvellous course, Bob!
  Oops!
  Fore!
