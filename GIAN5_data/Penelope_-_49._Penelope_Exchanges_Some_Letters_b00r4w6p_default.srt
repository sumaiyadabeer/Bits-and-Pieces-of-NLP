Catch!
Aw!
Dad, the postman's here!
Hello!
Hello, I have some letters for you.
  Thank you.
  Letters! We've got some letters!
Hello, everyone. Have you ever received any letters?
Mum, we've got some letters.
This is for Mum.
It's from a friend of mine.
Hmm...
This is for me.
Have I got any letters?
Oh, this is for you, Penelope.
  For me?
  Oh, you got a letter from Grandpa.
Please read it, read it to me!
"Dear Penelope, how are you? Today I went to the beach and went surfing."
Wow! Grandpa's great!
Yes! I'm going to write a letter to Grandpa!
  So you're going to write back?
  Yes, I am.
Let me see, um...
Oh!
Polly!
Yes. Grandpa, I played with Polly.
Ah! It's from Penelope.
I see Penelope and Polly are good friends.
OK, I will write another letter to her.
Mum, have I got any letters? Is there a letter for me?
Yes, you have one, it's from Grandpa.
Yippee!
"Dear Penelope, I played the guitar today."
Listen to what Grandpa did today!
Let me see... I wonder what Penelope's been doing.
I see! It seems Penelope can have fun even on a rainy day.
Did you get another letter from Grandpa?
Yes!
Look!
Grandpa collected some seashells.
He wrote to Penelope to say he found lots of seashells on the beach.
I wonder what the seashells look like. I'd like to see them.
Oh, Penelope looks sad.
I wonder why.
No letters for me today. I didn't get any yesterday either.
I wrote back to him.
I wonder why Grandpa hasn't sent me a letter.
Huh?
Oh, we have a visitor.
I wonder who it is.
Yes...
Grandpa!
Hello, Penelope. I've come to show you the seashells.
Wow! Big seashells! There's a pink one too!
This one is rainbow coloured.
A seashell necklace!
You look lovely, Penelope. You look like a mermaid princess.
A mermaid princess!
Thank you, Grandpa!
It's fun to write letters, isn't it? Let's write letters again, Penelope.
