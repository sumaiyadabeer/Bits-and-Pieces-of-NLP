Hello, I'm Alexander Armstrong, and welcome to Pointless, the quiz that puts obscure knowledge to the test.
  Let's meet today's players.
Welcome, Adrian and Amy. You are our first pair on the show today.
  How do you know each other?
  We've been married for ten years.
  Where are you from, Amy?
  We're from Belfast.
  What do you do?
I work for Royal National Institute of Blind People in Northern Ireland.
  The charity for blind people.
  And Adrian, what do you do?
I work for the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service.
  I'm a fireman in Belfast.
  Two VERY good people!
What would you like to see come up, Adrian? What would be good for you?
  Science fiction literature, maybe?
  Amy, what would be a good area for you?
I have a secret weapon.
I have a zombie plan, so any questions about zombies...
Really? How come you're so good on zombies?
I believe you should know your enemy, be prepared.
  I have a plan in place.
  What? For zombies or for...?
  Oh, yeah.
  Really? What do you do with zombies?
  If I told you, I've have to kill you.
  I think you should tell him!
But be prepared! I'm the Boy Scout of zombies.
Adrian and Amy, very best of luck. Next, we welcome Fred and Paul.
  How do you know each other?
  Well, he's my son.
  I've known him for all bar about ten seconds of his life.
  You were ten seconds late?
No, I was there. I was there, but I wasn't at the business end.
  I see. OK. OK.
  Where are you from, Paul?
  We're from Chesterfield in Derbyshire.
  What do you do, Fred?
  I'm a bus driver, for my sins.
  In Chesterfield itself?
  Yeah.
  Paul, how about you?
  I'm a civil servant.
  Can I ask what area of civil service?
  I've been told not to say.
  Oh!
  He's so involved in the zombie invasion, isn't he?
  Any categories you don't want, Fred?
Soaps.
  All the soaps?
  Yes, basically.
  EastEnders, I've never watched an episode.
  Paul, what about you?
  Politics and soaps, classical music.
  Right you are.
We'll see what the big man's got in store. Very best of luck, Fred and Paul.
  Next, we welcome Brian and Lisa. How do you know each other?
  Lisa's my younger daughter.
We've known each other for nearly 30 years. She's been a constant annoyance.
  Lisa, where are you from?
  Caerphilly in Wales.
  And what do you do?
I'm a chef. He's my boss.
  As well.
  We work together as well.
  So what do you do, Brian?
  I run the pub. It's a pub restaurant.
  Right you are.
  How long have you done that for, Lisa?
  12 years, on the books. Off the books, since I was six!
Have you got any tactics for the show today?
I'm going to go first so Dad can mop up after me.
  Is that standard practice?
  Yes.
  Standard procedure!
Well, very, very best of luck. Hope it works for you, Brian and Lisa.
Finally, we've got James and John. How do you know each other?
We're both studying masters in journalism at Staffordshire University.
I met John because I took him out on his first news story.
We covered a story together and have been really good mates ever since.
  What was the story?
  It was a story about Gillian McKeith, wasn't it?
  Penelope Keith.
  That's the one!
  But Gillian McKeith?
  It was my first story.
I was young, ambitious, naive.
  You didn't write anything down.
  No.
  What would you like to see come up?
  Not musicals.
Anything other than musicals. If musicals comes up, we might be reduced to tears.
Very best of luck, John and James.
We'll find out more about all of you later. There's only one person left to introduce.
While he gives out obscure facts, under the desk, he's pedalling away
to provide electricity for a small orphanage in Rutland.
He is my Pointless friend. He's Richard.
  Hiya.
  How are you?
  I'm very well.
  We've got four new pairs again today.
We've had a run of that recently. And a pretty big jackpot as well.
  It's getting excitingly high.
  Yeah. It is.
A couple of interesting, quite unusual rounds on today's show.
First one is, "What do we all think Paul does for a living?"
And round two is, "What happens if you cut the head off a zombie and it refuses to die?" That's round two.
All our questions have been put to 100 people before the show.
We are looking for the obscure answers they didn't get.
To be in with a chance of winning our jackpot, our players need to score as few points as possible.
What everyone's trying to do is find a pointless answer that none of our 100 people gave.
Then we add £250 to the jackpot. Nobody won the jackpot last time, so we add another £1,000 to that.
Today's jackpot starts off at...
Right, if everybody's ready, let's play Pointless.
In the first round, each of you gives me one answer, and you cannot confer.
The pair with the highest score will be eliminated.
If anyone gives me an incorrect answer, they will score the maximum of 100 points.
Our first category this afternoon is... It's Words.
Can you all decide who's going to go first, who's going second?
And whoever's going first, please step up to the podium.
OK, so our question concerns...
  "Ologies", Richard?
  We're going to give you a list of "ologies",
which are obviously fields of study.
You have to tell us what field of study relates to these "ologies",
a one word succinct answer.
Adrian and Amy, you drew lots before the show and you get to go first.
"Ologies", Amy, that's what we're looking for.
And here we have our first seven "ologies". They are...
..I'll read them one more time...
..You're trying to find one that the fewest of our 100 people knew.
  Amy, what are you going to say?
  I'm going to say,
  trichology for hair.
  Let's see if that's right.
If it is, how many people knew that answer? Hair for trichology.
It's right!
  22 for trichology.
  Well played, Amy.
A study of the structure, functions and diseases of the hair.
And what to do with zombie hair.
Yes. What DO you do with zombie hair?
You cut it off and bury it at a crossroads.
  Zombie hair is quite unmanageable.
You need a conditioner and a thickener before you dry as well.
Paul.
I know... Well, I think... I thought I knew a couple of them.
The actual definition's eluding me. I'll have to go for ichthyology.
  And fish.
  Ichthyology and fish, says Paul.
Let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people knew that.
It is right.
  11 for ichthyology.
  Well done, Paul.
They discover three new species of fish every week, on average.
  They're busy, the ichthyologists.
  Do they really?
  Yeah.
  Three new ones a week?
  Yeah.
  Where are they looking?
  Right.
  I'm going to say in the water.
Thank you very much, Richard. Now, Lisa.
I don't know any of them, but I'm going to take an educated guess.
Graphology. Graphs? Maps.
Graphology, maps, says Lisa.
Let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people knew graphology was maps.
Bad luck, Lisa. That's an incorrect answer. You score 100 points.
I'm sorry.
  Richard.
  Sorry, Lisa. It's not maps. The study of maps is cartography.
Now, James. We are looking for a one word answer to what these
"ologies" are.
Having an absolute mare.
Chromatology, I think.
  Just gonna go with metal.
  Chrome is a metal.
  Yeah.
Chromatology, says James. Metal. Is that right? How many people knew that answer?
That's an incorrect answer. You score 100 points.
  Richard.
  Yeah, sorry. Not metal.
Chromatology is a study of the Norfolk seaside town of Cromer.
It's not at all. It's the study of colours and colour.
Lisa, graphology is the study of handwriting.
  Ornithology, Alexander?
  Birds.
  Absolutely right.
  Seismology?
  Earthquakes.
  Absolutely right. Another big score.
  Hippology?
  I guess it's horses.
  It is horses.
That scored 13. Very well done if you got all seven at home.
We're halfway through the round, let's look at the scores. Paul and Fred.
Ichthyology. Great answer, as it turns out, Paul. The lowest score.
Then we go up to 22, where we find Amy and Adrian.
Then we go up a long way to 100   Lisa, Brian, James and John.
You are neck and neck, so it's going to be between Brian and John
to see who stays with us, I would imagine.
Can the second players please take their places at the podiums?
OK, we are looking for "ologies".
We're going to put seven more "ologies" on the board.
We have got...
..I'll read those one more time...
..There we are. Vexillology.
We are looking for the fields of study associated with them.
You're trying to find one the fewest of our 100 people knew. John.
You're high scorers. We have to do something about this.
We need a nice low scoring answer. Do you know any of those "ologies"?
I think...I know two.
They'd both be educated guesses.
I don't know them for certain.
I'm going to take a guess and say osteology.
Bones.
How many of our 100 people said osteology, bones?
It's right!
Not bad. Takes your total up to 136. Richard.
Might have kept yourself in it! The structure and function of bones.
  That's what they do. Human bones, animal bones.
  Dem bones!
  All sorts of bones.
  The bones.
  An ichthyosteologist is somebody who looks into fish bones.
Thanks very much, Richard. The round is hanging on your answer, Brian.
Everything decided by your next utterance.
We are looking for the fields of study described by these "ologies".
I think I know a couple of those. Not guaranteed.
  We need to get down fairly low...
  The high scorers are John and James.
You're still on 100. A score of 35 or less is necessary.
  Conchology. I think that's shells.
  Conchology, shells.
The second one down. Conchology, shells.
If you get below that line you're through to the next round.
Let's see if conchology's right and how many people said it.
It's right.
You've done it!
Takes you up to 121.
Well played, Brian. It's one aspect of malacology, the study of molluscs.
Do you think concholoichthyologists are shellfish?
Yes, I think they're a bit shellfish but some are quite giving.
Fred, you are through to the next round, whatever happens.
Even if you score 100 points, you will not overtake John and James.
  So have some fun with our "ologies".
  I'll go for campanology.
  Bells.
  Campanology, bells, says Fred. Let's see if that's right.
If it is, how many people said it? No red line for you.
Campanology, bells.
Quite a popular "ology". Takes your total up to 64.
  Richard.
  It's a word that people have sort of heard of.
Statistically, someone will be going, "Campanology? That rings a bell."
It's nice, isn't it? Somebody will.
So, then. Adrian and Amy.
You're on 22. Even if you score 100 points,
you are through to the next round. Let's have an answer from you.
  Talk us through the board.
  There's not many I could talk you through.
I think haematology is the study of blood.
Good for zombies. Haematology, blood, says Adrian.
Let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people said haematology, blood.
It's right.
  That takes your total up to 91.
  Richard.
  Well played. Very good end to the round.
Let's take a look at the rest of the answers.
  Oenology.
  Wine.
  Absolutely.
  Sinology?
  I'm guessing Chinese.
  Well, China.
Vexillology is the best answer on the board.
  I have a feeling this is flags.
  Your feeling is correct.
If you got all of those on both passes, very, very well done.
So at the end of first round, the losing pair with the highest score
is James and John   a great score!
  Be good if we were playing darts.
  Yeah. Yes.
Not so good on Pointless.
John, James, it was a tough round for you but we'll see you next time,
when I'm sure you'll do much better.
  Thanks so much for playing, John and James.
For the remaining three pairs, it's time for round two.
There's only room for two pairs in the head to head, so one of the teams will be leaving us.
Our category for round two is...
..Can you decide in your pairs who's going first, who's going second?
Whoever's going first, please step up to the podium.
We gave 100 people 100 seconds to name as many...
..as they could.
The name of any country which has hosted a FIFA World Cup tournament
and also the year in which they hosted it.
Any nation that's hosted the World Cup. If they've hosted it more than once, we'll take either year.
Very best of luck.
What is the most obscure FIFA World Cup tournament you can think of?
Amy, once again, you are going first. Is this a terrible question?
This is an absolutely awful question for me.
I don't know anything about football.
I'm going to have to have just a mad guess.
I'll say...Cameroon in 1974!
  Cameroon, 1974.
  Absolutely.
  The Zombie World Cup!
OK, let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people said Cameroon 1974.
Bad luck!
That's an incorrect answer. You score the maximum of 100 points.
  Paul.
  Um...
I've got a couple, but they'll be fairly high.
I'm going to go for 2002, with South Korea and Japan.
Let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people said 2002 South Korea and Japan.
Great answer, Paul.
Down it goes. Very well done!
That'll do!
  South Korea and Japan.
  Good answer, Paul.
Brazil beat Germany in the final.
  Lisa, a nice obscure FIFA World Cup tournament.
  Y yes.
One that's going to score you as few points as possible.
I think I know when the first one was, but I don't want to risk it.
I'm not sure of the date. I know the country.
I'm going to say the one just gone, 2010, South Africa.
  2010, South Africa.
  Yeah.
  Let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people said 2010, South Africa.
It's right.
Perfectly good answer. Not a bad score at all.
Well done, Lisa. First ever African host nation.
Or second, if you count Cameroon.
At the end of the round, I'll ask you what you thought for the first one.
We're halfway through the round, so let's look at the scores.
Paul and Fred looking extremely strong.
Then Lisa and Brian on 23. Then up to 100,
where we find Amy and Adrian   the pressure is on you, Adrian.
You've got to find a really low scoring answer and hope that's enough.
OK, can the second players please take their places at the podium?
We're looking for FIFA World Cup tournaments. Now, Brian!
You're on 23. 100 is the high score, Adrian and Amy over there.
If you score 76 or less, you're through to the head to head.
I've got one in mind, but I'm not certain about the year.
I'm going to go Italy 1980.
There is your red line. Below that, you're through. Italy 1980.
Is that right? How many people said it?
Ooh!
Brian! I'm so sorry. That's an incorrect answer.
Takes your total up to 123.
It scores the maximum of 100 points. Fred, you are through to the next round, whatever happens.
The high score of 123 is out of reach, even if you score 100 points.
I can think of the first one, but I'm not certain.
I'm going to go for 1954, Switzerland.
1954, Switzerland. No red line for you. Let's see if it's right.
If it is, how many people said it?
It's right.
I imagine this will be a lovely low score.
And it is!
I'm sorry it wasn't pointless. It's the next best thing.
Well played, Fred.
They called the final "the miracle of Bern" when West Germany beat Hungary.
  They hadn't lost for 31 games before that.
  Adrian.
You're on 100. The high scorers are Brian and Lisa on 123.
This is very exciting. Your answer decides the outcome of this round.
I THINK Mexico in 1976.
It may be an answer. I'm hoping it's an answer!
Was there a World Cup in Mexico in 1976?
If you get below that red line, Adrian and Amy,
you are through to the next round. Mexico, 1976.
Is it going to do it for you?
Bad luck. That is an incorrect answer and scores you 100 points.
Takes your total up to 200.
Richard. Sorry, Adrian, no World Cup in 1976.
Mexico did hold it in 1970 and in 1986.
So if you put them together, you've kind of got a right answer.
Brian, no World Cup in '80. It's Italia '90.
Lisa, what were you going to go for for the first World Cup?
Uruguay or Paraguay. I think it's Uruguay. 1934?
  Fred, were you going to have a go?
  1930, Uruguay.
  Absolutely right. Would have scored four points.
  Good effort.
A couple of pointless answers...
  ..Very well done if you said those. How many people do you think said England, 1966?
  No? 29?
  Yeah.
  Wow.
  And that 29 for England was the top answer, as you might imagine.
  Very low, isn't it?
  Yeah. Very.
Very low, indeed. At the end of round two, the losing pair with the highest score,
it's Adrian and Amy.
Oh, dear, oh, dear! 200, though!
It's a good score to go out on. You join our illustrious 200 Club.
  And zombies didn't come up, Amy.
  Maybe next time.
Maybe next time.
Adrian and Amy, we look forward to seeing you next time, when I hope you'll do better.
  Adrian and Amy.
For the remaining two pairs, things are about to get even more exciting, as we enter the head to head.
Congratulations, Fred and Paul, Brian and Lisa.
You are only one round away from the chance to play for the jackpot,
which currently stands at £12,750.
Clearly, only one pair can play for that money,
so you're now going head to head on the best of three questions.
The first pair to win two questions will be playing for that jackpot.
And you are now allowed to confer. Let's play the head to head.
OK, here comes your first question.
And it concerns...
..People with hyphenated surnames. Richard.
We'll show you five pictures of people with double barrelled surnames.
Can you name the most obscure? I need first name and surname. I mean surnames. Very best of luck.
Let's reveal our five people with hyphenated surnames.
And here they come...
..There you are. You have five people with hyphenated surnames.
We would like you to name the one
you think the fewest of our 100 people recognised.
Fred and Paul, because you've played best throughout, you go first.
We'll go for C,
Tara Palmer Tomkinson.
Fred and Paul say that C is Tara Palmer Tomkinson.
Brian and Lisa, you can talk us through all the others,
then submit the one you would like to answer with.
  Sophie Ellis Bextor. I'm out.
  I'm not sure about them either.
I know the face of B. I can't think of his name.
  So we've got to go with A.
  Yeah.
  A, Sophie Ellis Bextor.
Sophie Ellis Bextor, A, you are saying.
Fred and Paul are saying that C is Tara Palmer Tomkinson.
Let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people said Tara Palmer Tomkinson.
Yup. It's right.
Tara Palmer Tomkinson scored 39.
Now, Brian and Lisa say A,
Sophie Ellis Bextor. Let's see if that's right.
If it is, how many people said it. 39, the score you have to beat.
It's right.
  Ooh! 41!
I'm surprised. I thought you were going to beat that.
Fred and Paul astounded that they managed to win this with Tara Palmer Tomkinson.
Fred and Paul are ahead, one nil. Richard.
The two highest scoring answers on the board there.
B is Adam Hart Davis, the broadcaster and writer.
D. Do you recognise D?
  Gosh! Newton John.
  It's never.
  Olivia Newton John.
  Just got it!
Would have been a great answer.
E, one of the greatest female athletes of all time.
Heptathlete, long jumper. Six Olympic medals, three golds.
The American, Jackie Joyner Kersee. That's a pointless answer.
  Very well done if you got that.
  Thank you very much, indeed.
So here comes your second question, and it concerns...
  ..Richard.
  We're going to show you five Madonna UK Top 40 singles,
but we're only going to give you the initials.
  Can you name the most obscure of them?
  Thanks very much, Richard.
Before I reveal those Madonna songs, Brian and Lisa,
I remind you that you have to win this question to stay in the game. £12,750 is riding on it.
Here they come.
And we have got...
..I'll read them one more time...
..Brian and Lisa, you go first.
We're going to go for ITG, Into The Groove.
Into The Groove. OK. Into The Groove say Brian and Lisa.
  Fred and Paul?
  Do you know any of the others?
You can talk us through the board.
If you win this question, you go through to the final.
CAC looks familiar, but I don't know.
  I only know PDP.
  It's the only one I know.
We have to go for PDP, Papa Don't Preach.
So we have Into The Groove from Brian and Lisa,
and Papa Don't Preach from Fred and Paul.
Brian and Lisa first with Into The Groove, ITG.
Let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people said it.
19 for Into The Groove. Happy with that?
  Is it good enough to keep you in the game?
  Yeah.
  Fred and Paul agree!
Papa Don't Preach, PDP.
Let's see if that's right and, if it is, how many people said it.
It's right.
  Wow!
  See? We don't know everything!
Which means, after two questions, you are absolutely even, one all.
CAC is the real killer answer.
Let's look at the rest of them. V, Vogue. A pretty high scorer.
  DCFMA, Xander, you know that one?
  No.
  It's from a musical.
  Ah!
  Don't Cry For Me, Argentina.
  That was 13 points.
That would have won you the point. CAC, best answer on the board.
From the soundtrack to Who's That Girl? Causing A Commotion.
  Very well done if you got that.
  Thank you very much, Richard.
Here comes your third question, the exciting part of the head to head.
This decides who goes through to the final and plays for that jackpot
of £12,750.
Here it comes.
It concerns...
..The space race.
  Richard.
  We're giving you five clues to facts about the space race.
Which of these is the most obscure, to get yourselves into the final?
Five facts about the space race. Here come five clues.
And they are...
..I'll read those all again...
..There are your five clues to facts about lunar travel.
  Fred and Paul, you go first again.
  We're going to go for "first dog to orbit the Earth", Laika.
  Laika,
say Fred and Paul, for the first dog to orbit the Earth.
Brian and Lisa, you can talk us through all the other answers.
  Laika was going to be my answer.
  That was it.
  We knew Laika.
Russian equivalent of astronaut.
Sea of Tranquillity.
  That'll be fairly popular, though.
  I think they all will.
We'll go for "lunar sea where the Eagle landed".
We're going with Tranquillity.
OK, the Sea of Tranquillity say Brian and Lisa
as the lunar sea where the Eagle landed.
This is very exciting,
the deciding question between the father and son team from Chesterfield
and the father and daughter team from Caerphilly.
Fred and Paul went with Laika, the name of the first dog to orbit the Earth.
Is it right? How many people said Laika?
It's right.
20 for Laika. That's quite high.
  Higher than I was expecting.
  I was thinking it would be lower.
Brian and Lisa said the Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquillity.
Let's see if it's right and how many people said it. 20 is the score to beat to get a place in the final.
It's right.
38 for the Sea of Tranquillity, which means, after three questions,
Fred and Paul are through to the final, two one.
Big score, 38. 20's quite a big score for Laika.
For that one, at least, Madonna did write a Top 40 single.
  Laika.
  "Laika Virgin".
About the first dog in space. One answer would have won the point.
Year of the last mission to the moon. Did you know that one?
Well done if you said that at home.
  Second man on the moon scored less than Sea of Tranquillity.
  Really?
And the Russian equivalent of astronaut...
Well done anybody who got all 15 answers in the head to head.
Thank you, Richard. So, the losing pair at the end of the head to head,
I'm afraid it's Brian and Lisa.
But we will see you again next time.
Meanwhile, thanks so much for playing. Thank you.
But for Fred and Paul, it's time for our Pointless final.
Congratulations, you fought off all the competition
and you have won our coveted Pointless trophy, so very well done.
You now have a chance to win our Pointless jackpot, and at the end of today's show, it stands at £12,750.
You're now only three answers away from £12,750.
The rules are very simple. To win that money, you have to find a pointless answer, just one.
We haven't had any today. Find one, and you will go home with the money.
First, you've got to choose a category from these five options...
It's going to be London or animated films, I think.
Not horse racing. I'm not up to horse racing.
Don't listen to the radio much.
Animated films? You'd be more with animated films than London.
It's one of the bottom two.
  Animated films.
  You're going for animated films.
If you had to nominate an area, what would it be? What would be a great question?
Pixar? Disney?
  Yeah, characters from films, maybe.
  Yeah.
Let's find out what the question is.
We gave 100 people 100 seconds to name as many...
Toy Story voice actors as they could. Richard.
Any actor or actress credited with providing a voice performance in any of the Toy Story films.
They must be credited on IMDB as voicing a named character.
Any characters in any of the three Disney Pixar Toy Story movies.
We need first names and surnames, please. Very best of luck.
Thanks very much, Richard. You have up to one minute to come up with three answers.
All you need to win that £12,750 is for one of those to be pointless.
  Are you ready?
  As we'll ever be.
  Let's put 60 seconds on the clock.
There they are. And your time starts now.
  Right, John Ratzenberger.
  John Ratzenberger.
  Who was the person...?
  Timothy Dalton.
  Yeah.
Who played Flik in Bug's Life?
Cos he did a cameo at the end of Toy Story 2.
  Joan Cusack?
  She'll be too high.
  Kelsey Grammer.
Oh! Who plays Rex...? Plays...
  the Grand Nagus in Star Trek.
  Yeah.
  I know who you mean.
  Wallace Shawn.
  Wallace Shawn.
  You think Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer...
  We'll keep Timothy Dalton.
  And John Ratzenberger?
  Yeah, yeah.
  We can do.
  Stick with those three?
  Yeah, go on.
  Stick with those three.
  Ten seconds left.
  You're happy?
  Yes.
  OK, we'll stop the clock.
We were looking for Toy Story voice actors. I now need three answers.
  John Ratzenberger.
  John Ratzenberger.
  Timothy Dalton.
  Timothy Dalton?
  And Wallace Shawn.
  Wallace Shawn.
Which is your best crack at a pointless answer?
  Wallace Shawn.
  We'll put Wallace Shawn last.
  Which is your least likely?
  John Ratzenberger.
  We'll put that first.
We'll put those up on the board in that order...
..There are your three answers.
We were looking for voice actors from the Toy Story films.
Your first answer was John Ratzenberger, your least confident answer.
You only have to find one pointless answer to win that jackpot of £12,750.
John Ratzenberger, is it right?
If it is, how many of our 100 people said John Ratzenberger?
It's right.
If this goes all the way down to zero,
you will leave here with £12,750.
  Oh, look at that! One!
One!
John Ratzenberger, unfortunately, not a pointless answer.
Must have been one of those zombies.
It's looking very good for your next answer. Timothy Dalton?
  He played Ken in the third one.
  No, he didn't. Mr Prickly.
  The hedgehog.
  Oh, he's the hedgehog!
  Is he?
  Yeah.
  I had no idea.
If you were to win the jackpot of £12,750,
what would you do with it, Paul?
I'd probably pay off my car and put the rest in savings for moving out.
Still got him at home!
  OK! Fred, how about you?
  Well, it's our 40th anniversary this year.
  We're going abroad. Hopefully pay for a holiday to Peru.
  Not me!
  Not taking him!
  I'm staying at home.
We are looking for voice actors from the Toy Story films.
You have two more answers that might win you that jackpot.
Let's hope nobody said your next answer, Timothy Dalton.
This has to be right and it has to be pointless for you to win that jackpot of £12,750.
Timothy Dalton. Is it right? How many people said it?
It is right.
If this takes you to zero, you leave with £12,750...
  Yes! You've done it!
Very, very well done.
  Thank you very much.
  Very good, indeed. Superb!
Congratulations. Timothy Dalton was a pointless answer,
which means you leave here with the jackpot of £12,750.
  Wow! Richard.
  Here's a sentence you never thought you'd hear.
  Mr Pricklepants the hedgehog has just won you £12,750!
Wallace Shawn, who played Rex, the guy from Princess Bride,
would have scored you one point.
  Two ones and a zero!
It's the zero that matters. Let's look at some other pointless answers...
..John Lasseter is the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar.
Laurie Metcalfe plays the mum from Roseanne.
Michael Keaton plays Ken.
Ned Beatty plays the Lotso hugs teddy.
R. Lee Ermey is from Full Metal Jacket,
the sergeant who does the extraordinary speech.
Whoopi Goldberg plays Stretch the octopus.
A few others, Jeff Garlin, Wayne Knight are pointless. Very well done if you got any of those at home.
Particularly well done to you guys. You played brilliantly throughout.
Thanks to our winning players, Fred and Paul, who go away with today's jackpot of £12,750.
