Hello and welcome to Windsor Park on a pivotal night of European
Championship football. It's Northern Ireland against Serbia.
Both sides chasing that crucial second place in group C. Both in
Three points tonight is a must. Pushing as that ball goes over.
It's in! Aaron Hughes, I thought he It's in! Aaron Hughes, I thought he
was never going to score. That is class. We know. Match commentary
and team news comes compliments of Jacqui Fullerton.
The big talking point about the Northern Ireland line up is all
about the men missing. Lafferty and last month's Man of the Match
McCourt both missing because of injury. Their absence is a major
setback. On the plus side, Chris Brunt is back from sus suspension
and he will Healy up front. Evans will be on the right. McCann on the
left. Serbia, they're missing Manchester
United defender Vidic but a number of good names here. Ivanovic of
Chelsea. Midfielder Jovanovic had a spell at Liverpool. The Captain is
Stankovic from Inter Milan. And Tosic, he had a year and a half at
Manchester United, will help Pantelic up front. They get the
goals in Belgrade back in March. Away we go.
Here is an early break. McCann. Good challenge there from Steve
Davis. It's one of those special nights at Windsor Park, both sides
really need the win to keep their euro dreams alive. Expect a
physical contest. Here is Stankovic. The play maker.
Not a bad ball from the skipper. Tosic.
Dangerous ball in. McAuley there to deal with it. Davis was fouled on
the way threw. Northern Ireland get the free kick. Davis, he missed the
2 1 defeat in Serbia. But an early warning there from Stankovic, what
uplifted that 4 0 win over the Faroe Islands, in Serbia's last
qualifier that was in March, they they're favourites tonight, they've
four wins in the last 12. They've no wins in their last four. They've
scored only two goals in their last four games. Who knows? Virtually a
sellout crowd of 15,500 at Windsor Park to see it. No Serbian fans, of
course, they're banned after the trouble their fans caused in Italy
a few months ago. He had to go through on the challenge. Again it
was Ninkovic. Baird, he did well and then he made a little mistake.
Chance for the Serbs and Stankovic to put Northern Ireland on the back
foot. Skipper decides to leave it. It's given away. Healy, he's had to
come deep. No way around Kolarov, the man from Man City.
Northern Ireland, you could get 13  5 the Serbs 6 5. Their coach, a
former Arsenal player, he said I think tongue in cheek, his team
were the underdogs tonight. It's all mind games, isn't it? Get it
not play well in the first half, but they regrouped, they changed
tactics and won the game in the Brings a save from the keeper.
Chris Brunt has yet to score, well he has got one goal, in fact. He
hasn't scored in this campaign. He well. Evans finds Baird. Back to
Hughes, has to go long. Ninkovic. Here he is again. Jovanovic, the
man who had a dreadful time at Liverpool. Causing problems for
Northern Ireland. He hits it, oh, it's off the bar! It took a
deflection. He's disappointed. He was unlucky, as well. That could
have been screaming into the top corner, but for a little deflection.
I think we will see it here. Jovanovic, on to his left foot.
There is the deflection, off Aaron Hughes. Just there.
skipper. Pantelic. Stankovic couldn't pick up on it. Good run by
the skipper. He's got one goal in these championships and he's
winning his 99th Tonight, the 32  year old from Inter. He's had a
long successful career. There is the great play. But a woeful finish,
it has to be said. He will not want Johnny Evans. Hughes. Good pressure
from the Serbs. And Healy doesn't have too much chance for the long
He is now with CSKA Moscow after a poor stint at Old Trafford. Took a
deflection again but Camp no problems. He has plenty of problems
at club level at the minute, Lee Camp at Nottingham Forest, they've
made a poor start in the championship. Chris Brunt. We need
him to see more of the ball to weave a bit of his left footed
magic. Tosic. He is a tricky too much of the number nine but
Northern Ireland will be happy about that. Here is Tosic. He gets
a corner. Evans did well. He knew he was behind him. The man from
Manchester United thawarts the man ball comes in, the keeper got there.
It falls to Stankovic. Just couldn't keep it down. A little
rueful smile there. He has had a couple of chances. He has
squandered a couple of chances. This really isn't a chance but it
will have been a very good goal had he kept it down. Funny enough,
being a goalkeeper, Lee Camp will be enjoying this, they like to be
kept busy, strut their stuff. He has had a couple of good saves
already, Lee Camp. But he is Danger here. Oh! Just over. Well,
Lee Camp, his heart must have been pounding then. I am not sure he
made the right decision to come out when he did. McAuley with a haunted
look. Does the keeper come, does he stay? He was in no man's land and
the striker did well but just couldn't lob it beneath the
crossbar. this wet night, as the rain comes
of the evening. Frank Foley, Grant McCann has not been but so far in
Evans putting his body on the line.    block. Real danger again for the
home team. Johnny events, brave as you like, to keep it away from Lee
staff, it has been a reigning all that was required. The Northern
Ireland crowd quiet for a moment. They realise their team are second
best at the moment, without Northern Ireland players are less
than happy with that challenge.    might be at be king.    a booking.
It is a yellow card. The crowd were wanting a red card. It was a very
awkward challenge. Healy was putting his head down. Brave as you
like, David Healy, but he felt that, no question. Was he fortunate not
to get a red? In injury time at the end of this first half, into the
Serbian half, that a ball goes forward. It would be a good time to
score. But not with a finish like referee. The chances have all come
to Serbia. Johnny Evans, a couple of tremendous blocks. Northern
Ireland have been strong in defence, in attack and non existent. At
half time, it is Nell Tunnell.    1964, the debut, along with the
George Best, against Wales. His final cap, 12th June, 1986, beaten
by Brazil in the World Cup finals on his 43rd birthday. Another
he will have planned it. He has had to rally his troops. Those fans are
doing their best. It is a very poor night, weather Wise. How will it
end up at result wise? It is looking ominous, but stranger
things have happened in football. Second half under way. 45 crucial
Serbs. Northern Ireland will be grateful they are not getting that
here. This is good for Northern Ireland, it is very good, but not
good enough. Healy was there, but good ball, but not quite. Healey
and branches are left wondering first team games at Old Trafford
a link up with a D Evans boys. Johnny on the plank, Corry Evans in
not get up highly enough. It has been a bright start to this half by
Evans and Corry Evans will miss the game in Estonia. He had already
been booked so that will add to Nigel Worthington's problems. The
21 year old is out of the game in themselves out of trouble and there
may well be trouble for Northern Ireland but Johnny Evans is there
once again. Having a solid game. Just shows you what a regular place
for Manchester United in the how, but it is more encouragement.
Lovely stuff from him again, that encouraged by the start to the
second half, without question. That was a bit slack there from Grant
That idea took a deflection or it is a very good save.    that I
there took a deflection.    either. He would have been proud of that.
Northern Ireland is have enjoyed in nice spell of pressure in that the
Serbian half. They are now having hear the buzz around Windsor Park.
I think he might be aware that his side had slipped back a little back.
He is about to make a change, I what has happened here. Pantelic
has done it. 10th international goal. He scored one against
Northern Ireland in Belgrade. And here, it is a sword through
Northern Ireland's heart. It put Serbia won the Nell in front 25
minutes into this second half.    1 nil. He took his time. Steve
Davis will not want to see this believe it, either. It is up hell
now.    uphill. Even the goal has not silenced the Northern Ireland
Jovanovic. Great save by Lee Camp. Well done. That number one. Give
skwrof I don't have top marks, lovely skill. Tremendous finish.
Great reflexes from Lee Camp. Johnny Evans is booked. The two
Evans brothers both booked, both miss Estonia on Tuesday night. This
result will be hard to take. So Nigel Worthington getting a new
contract, it's already been offered. There'll be talks about that and
his future, I am sure, over the next few months. Plenty of debate
amongst the administerors and the supporters. Didn't fall for Baird.
The referee brings it to an end. You can see the disappointment
there. Petrovic will take the three points. Look at the delight for the
Serbians. There's the man that got the goal, Pantelic. He gave it away,
sadly. Not a night to remember for Steve Davis, not a night for
Northern Ireland to remember. Serbia, they're back in the mix in
the group. But the finals, surely, for those fans, have dropped off
the radar for Northern Ireland. Final score in this group C
qualifier, a very disappointing Northern Ireland 0, Serbia 1.
got to bear in mind they're a very good side, they're in the top 20.
The players and the clubs they're at, they can interchange. We found
it hard dealing with that the first half but got the players in and
settled down and twaebged one or two things and had a go at it in
the second half and I am delighted for the players because they
deserved that. We have to concentrate on the last three games
and pick up as many points as we can and hope a couple of other
teams drop some and we can still find ourselves in it. But can't
fault the effort tonight. First half they showed how good they were.
But we stuck together, we kept a good shape. We went out second half
and had a lot of the ball and and unfortunate with the goal, one of
those things and they hit us with that sort of counterattack goal. We
are disappointed but there's a lot of positives we can take tonight
but at the end of the day we have lost and that's the disappointing
thing. As far as the two yellow cards, from Corry's point of view,
he was on a booking, got a second. Johnny, got away with it a few
moments earlier, and I thought he was going to sail through but he
had another flick at the player and got cautioned, so that's
frustration and again Johnny is young. I thought he had a fantastic
game tonight and he will learn from that. So, didn't help our situation
on Tuesday. But that's a game of football, you deal with it and meet
it head on and that's what we will do. We will do our best, as we
always do and I am 100% behind them, the players are a fantastic group.
They give their all for the Northern Ireland and that's all I
as a manager can ask them to do and results overall have been top class
from our point of view. So, disappointment tonight, and in this
game it's how quickly you get over the disappointment and bounce back.
A check on the results this much at Windsor Park ends with
Northern Ireland failing to deliver and it would appear that
qualification is now all but gone. Joining me former international
Captain Jim McGilton. It does look very much like the game is up?
I think so. Tonight was a big night and three points will have been so
pressure going into next week's game so yeah, it's huge
disappointment. And you look to that and you go to Estonia now,
Estonia having won this evening on a high and you take them back here
and it's away to Italy. That in itself is sa different run in.
is. They knew that before that. They knew tonight, that's why
tonight was so important. So, they'll go back and reflect and
obviously they'll go and have a go against Estonia and try and win the
game. They're going to have to win all three. Back to early doors in
the game itself, the opening chance, it fell to Chris Brunt. You were
screaming in the terraces here. Play Healy in, it did look if he
did it could have been an early goal. It was a great passage of
play. If he had gone across the keeper maybe the keeper had to make
a save, I know David was on top of it. I felt he didn't really see him.
That was a promising start and thought they could build on that.
There were warning signs. They hit the woodwork and Kolarov produces a
great great save from Lee Camp, Camp one of the highlights. He was
the sponsored Man of the Match. Serbia controlled large chunks of
play, kept possession of the football. I thought Northern
Ireland gave the ball away cheaply at times and that's not like them.
They did have little patches in the game but overall you have to say
that Serbia probably deserved to win the game. Second half they came
out, they are rejuvenated. Johnny Evans breaks down the left, sends
in a great ball. Young Corry on the end of it, we were all thinking 1 0.
That was probably their best passage of play and a great ball,
brother to brother. I am sure they've done that many times. He
just didn't time it properly, that was a glorious chance. At this
level and them chances come along, you have to score. The second one
Healy on the end of it, when he gets the cross it breaks for Brunt,
great, great pass. He makes the ground up. He does everything right.
score. Serbia defended that particularly well. Both the Evans
boys misthe Estonia game. McCourt probably out and Lafferty too. It
isn't good. No, and the manager, this is where he is going to earn
his corn, he is going to have to lift a group of players
disappointed. They know tonight that was maybe qualification for
another major event gone. The goal, we have to get to it. Steven Davis,
who is a quality player, he just seemed to switch off. Curtains.
Very disappointing for him personally, because I thought he
played very well in the game. It was just one of them lapses of
concentration that cost you and again at this level you can't
afford to give top class players that opportunity. He finishes it
well. But the very least they deserve was a draw tonight and we
gifted them a goal. Fans getting on Nigel's back this evening, do you
feel that's harsh given you looked at the bench and there's not a lot
there. You have to acknowledge resources are limited. I think it's
harsh because you lose two quality players from any squad, with
Lafferty and McCourt it's going to hurt and it hurt tonight. OK. There
were, of course, a series of important games played in Europe
this evening. Let's check on a for Northern Ireland is Estonia.
Can they pick themselves up? The match will be live on Tuesday
evening on BBC Radio Ulster from 7.00pm. On a pivotal evening of
European Championship park here in Windsor Park Northern Ireland come
