Today at Six: Thousands of North Koreans gather to say an official
farewell to Kim Jong Il. It's the first of two days of funeral
services for the dictator they called The Dear Leader.
Many North Koreans appeared overcome with emotion as the world
tries to make sense of the new regime there. Also: A new contract
It's great news, especially over the Christmas period and there's
been people that have been laid off, so they're probably feeling sad
over Christmas about losing their jobs, but now they can see a little
glimmer of hope in the future. After this Indian student was shot
dead on Boxing Day, police in Salford now arrest a fourth
teenager. From the depths of the Indian Ocean,
Good evening. In North Korea thousands of people have gathered
for the start of two days of funeral services for Kim Jong Il,
world community for any clues about the balance of power in the new
regime. The BBC is not allowed into North Korea, so our world affairs
editor, John Simpson, reports from neighbouring South Korea.
Good one The weeping announcer, doleful music, the slow movement of
Kim Jong Il's cortege, it was all intensely choreographed, with the
young, completely inexperienced Kim Jong Un taking over, this is a
difficult moment for the North Korean dictatorship.
And since the Government demanded grief, the crowds provided it, in
bucketloads. A bit of this may even be genuine, but each one of these
people knows it's what's expected of them and occasionally you catch
a glimpse of a soldier filming the crowd, so they don't forget. A
select few talked to camera T doesn't exactly sound spontaneous.
The snow is falling like tears, he says, how could the Heavens not cry
cry when we have lost our General, who was a great man from the
Heavens? Down here in Seoul, stuff like that
just sounds absurd. But is any of the grief genuine? This is Jung
Gwang Il, he did time in a northern labour camp, then escaped to South
Korea. The people we saw get more food and
consumer goods, so maybe they had a reason to cry. But those in the
countryside who have nothing won't be sorry he is dead. The succession
has now passed peacefully to the third generation of the family
business. But Kim Jong Un is so young and inexperienced he will
need backup. The man walking behind him here is his uncle, who will be
a key player. Still, Kim Jong Un has the right credentials.
elite of North Korea know that they need him. They need a blood
descendent for their legitimacy. Once they lose that, they're in
trouble. But it's a worrying inheritance all the same. This year
hasn't been a good one for dictators.
For the latest we can talk to John in Seoul. You mentioned the
succession there in your report, are there any more clues today
about the nature of this new regime that's emerging? It's too early for
that. We did get one little PR touch from the team that are trying
to create a kind of legend, a myth about the new man, just as they
created them about his father and grandfather. They said that Kim
Jong Un had been   felt so sorry for all the people freezing out in
the cold that he ordered hot drinks to be taken to them. Now, you and I
may think that's pretty small stuff, but here you can see the direction
that they want to go in, the loving kind of leader, the man who thinks
about the people T won't necessarily be true, who knows
whether it will be true, but that's the direction it's going to. It's
just simply that these are difficult days for dictators and
North Korea is the hardest, nastiest dictatorship still left
affloat. Who knows whether it can swim for all that much longer.
Thank you. The trainmaker Bombardier, based in
Derby, has been awarded a new contract worth �188 million. But
the deal to build carriages for the rail company Southern was funded,
in part, by a Government subsidy worth �80 million. The Department
for Transport had been criticised for rejecting Bombardier for a much
bigger Thameslink contract worth �1.4 billion. From Derby, Anthony
Bartram reports. Trains have been built in Derby for
over a century. 2011 has been one of the toughest in Bombardier's
history and fears for its future brought people out on to the city
streets in their thousands to protest about the loss of 1400 jobs
and a crucial Government contract to overseas competition. But new
work announced today brings some consolation and security. It's
great news, especially over the Christmas period and there's been
people that have been laid off, so they're probably feeling sad over
Christmas about losing their jobs, but now they can see a little
glimmer of hope in the future. train makers change of fortune has
been welcomed, but unions say the scale of the new order has to be
taken in context. Bombardier's successful contract with Southern
Trains is worth �188 million. It's been subsidised by Government to
the tune of �80 million. In June, the company failed to get the
Thameslink contract, valued at �1.4 billion.
The Department of Transport awarded it instead to Siemens of Germany.
think this is a substantial contract. It will see work for the
next 12 18 months take place. It's one of a number the Government will
be putting out to tender over the coming years, we are putting a huge
amount of investment into our railways at the moment. Today's
announcement will be welcome news to Bombardier's workforce which is
enjoying its Christmas break and the company says the decision was a
vote of confidence in its work. But one thing Bombardier won't be drawn
on is what impact this order will have on future jobs on this site.
Production lines get moving again in the new year with engineers
looking forward to 130 new carriages to build and breathing
space perhaps to secure even more work here.
Police in Salford investigating the murder of an Indian student have
made a fourth arrest. Anuj Bidve was shot in the early hours of
Boxing Day. One man and three teenagers are now being questioned.
A gentle man who brought a smile to anyone's face, speaking from India
over the internet Anuj Bidve's cousin says they're struggling to
come to terms with his death. were extremely shocked, but his
parents, grandparents and family now getting older they're
completely shatter stkpwhrd in Salford today forensic officers
were back at the place where the student was shot dead in front of
his friends. It's been almost three days and every inch is still being
searched. But why was Anuj Bidve shot?
Detectives believe his killer asked him for the time, he replied and
it's then thought the gun was fired at point blank range. The shock of
what's happened is beginning to show on the streets. It's not just
sadness felt here in Salford, it's embarrassment, too. Local people
won't be interviewed because they say this shooting has brought shame
on the community. They feel sorry for the family in India. We will be
travelling to the UK to get Anuj Bidve's body back to India and we
will come there and talk to all authorities to explain the process
and we will try and get his body back to India.
Anuj Bidve's family hope to be in England by the end of the week.
They say they want justice for the 23 year old who only came to
Manchester that night to enjoy the festivities, but died on a street
thousands of miles from home. A young woman found stabbed to
death in Borehamwood Hertfordshire has been named as Catherine Wynter.
The body was discovered 8.00am yesterday morning by her mother.
But the police believe she was killed on Boxing Day night, stabbed
to death as she babysat her sister's two children, a three 
year old and a four year old. She was last seen alive at 7.30pm,
after that it's unclear exactly what happened. Two men have been
arrested, an 18 year old and 26  year old. They are known to have
been known by Catherine. They're being questioned in a local police
station at the moment. What's not clear at this stage is what the   
whether the two children witnessed the attack. They're with specially
trained police officers who are trying to get information from them.
In Syria, state television reports that 755 people being held for
their role in the uprising have been released. All detained
protesters are meant to be freed under a peace plan set out by the
Arab League, whose monitors are continuing their visit to the
country. But the UN estimates that some 14,000 have been detained
during the protests and more than 5,000 killed by President Assad's
forces, as Caroline Hawley reports. Reassuring may have been the
verdict of the Arab League but this is footage posted on the internet
by opposition activist who is fear the observers will not be allowed
to see the true face of the Syrian regime.
We can't be sure exactly where or when it was filmed but it appears
to show clashes in the town of Homs yesterday. The very day the Arab
League monitors arrived. Under the terms of the peace plan, peaceful
demonstrations are supposed to be allowed. Freeing political
prisoners is another of the key demands of the agreement and today
in a gesture to the observers the Syrian authorities say they've
released 755. But that's a small fraction of the thousands being
held and Human Rights Watch says it's been told that as many as 600
detainees may have been transferred to military sites to hide them from
the Arab monitors. State run television showed their
visit to Homs, all quiet when this was filmed. The observers are led
by a Sudanese General and accompanied by the Syrian
authorities. And there are only 60 of them at the moment. Far too few,
critics say, for the crisis Syria is in. The regime is attempt ing to
use this for public relations purposes, the question is are these
monitors there to sightsee, be part of regime's public relations
apparatus? At the moment it's toothless. The mission is meant to
help stem the bloodshed but the toll is rising all the time. These
are Syrians being treated in hospital just inside Lebanon,
refugees still frightened to be identified after they fled.
She has shrapnel in the head, he says, we had to come here so she
could be properly treated. The credibility of the Arab League
monitors is on the line and with the violence apparently continuing
in Homs today, even in their presence, the omens for their
mission are not good. At the Old Bailey, the judge at the
Stephen Lawrence murder trial has told jurors to set aside any
emotion in their deliberations. David Norris and Gary Dobson deny
murdering the black teenager in south east London in 1993. The
defence says that forensic evidence against them was contaminated. The
judge said sympathy for the Lawrence family, or anger at the
nature of the attack, could not guide the jury's verdict, as Tom
Symonds reports. The final final act of this high
profile trial, 18 years after the stabbing of Stephen Lawrence. His
family, including his brother Stewart, here on the right, have
all been in court. Defendants Gary Dobson and David Norris were
brought from prison by van for the judge's summing up. Mr Justice
He set out for the jury the routes they must take to reach a verdict.
He said they had to be sure forensic evidence came from Stephen
Lawrence, and that there had been no contamination of the evidence
while in storage bags. They had to be sure either defendant had been
present and participating in the attack.
To be guilty of murder, the defendant must have intended to
kill Stephen or cause him serious harm. But under the laws of joint
enterprise, if they realised another member of the group
intended to kill, that could also be murder. The jury can consider
manslaughter, as an alternative. The judge has been summarising all
of the evidence, including eyewitness descriptions of the
attack here on this road in Eltham and the detailed views of forensic
scientists. He told the jury they had to be sure of their verdicts,
but also that this trial wasn't some sort of detective novel where
all the loose ends were tied newspaper the final chapter, there
might be some unanswered questions once they had made their decisions.
David Norris and Gary Dobson both deny murder. The jury will begin
considering its verdicts tomorrow. Palestinian police have intervened
to stop a fight between rival priests at the Church of the
Nativity in Bethlehem. Around 100 Greek Orthodox and Armenian clerics
fought with brooms as they cleaned the church in preparation for the
Orthodox Christmas. There's been tension in the past between the
various Christian denominations sharing the church.
A chimpanzee believed to have starred in a number of Hollywood
films has died. It's even claimed that Cheetah was the famous co star
with Johnny Weissmuller in the Tarzan films of the 1930s. The
owners of the animal sanctuary in Florida where he died say he was 80
years old. A team of British scientists has
captured images of very rare species in some of the most
inaccessible parts of the Indian Ocean. They've been surveying
volcanic underwater vents where they found a remarkable array of
creatures living in the heated waters. They believe some of the
species may be new to science, as Daniel Boettcher reports.
A dark and mysterious world almost 3,000 meeters beneath the surface
of the Indian Ocean, these volcanic vents spew out superheated water.
It's an extreme environment. It's home to strange specially adapted
creatures. Researchers using a remote controlled robot have been
surveying an area in the south west Indian ridge, comparing it with
other ridges where life has already been well documented. And they
believe some of the species they found may be new to science. For
example, this yeti crab, it's unlike species recorded in the
Pacific. It's like a crossroads for marine life. Our task is to
understand how creatures are related to other species elsewhere
understand how kwraels    animals disperse and evolve in the deep
ocean. Volcanic vents support unusual food chains which rely on
chemical energy, rather than sunlight. Because the the vents
aren't around for long creatures have to be able to move between
them to survive. As technology improves, scientists aren't the
