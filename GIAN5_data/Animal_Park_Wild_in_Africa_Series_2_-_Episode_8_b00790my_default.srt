Hello and welcome to Wild In Africa. I'm Ben Fogle.
And I'm Kate Humble and we're on our way through the vast Namib Desert in the west of Namibia.
At 81,000 square kilometres, this wilderness is larger than England.
However, there are plenty of animals living here and we'll be meeting some of them later on.
Here's what's coming up on today's programme.
A cat called Vidal needs medical help.
  But leopards don't make good patients.
  They attack people.
They won't run away.
They make a nasty mess of people.
He's got the largest bill of any bird of prey in the world and he'll give you a nasty nip with that.
And this desert is so tough, even the vegetarians are deadly.
Ostrich are very aggressive birds, especially the male ones.
They can kill a man.
But we're starting off on Namibia's plains
where it's a busy day at the Africat Foundation.
The aim of this charity is to rescue all kinds of big cats
and then return them to the wild as soon as possible.
Sometimes they have to stay for a spell to recover from injuries
and then there are the permanent residents for whom a life in the wild is not an option.
Come round this way.
From time to time, British born vet Mark Jago comes out to do a batch of routine health checks.
Gerhard Steenkamp, a specialist in wildlife dentistry.
Healthy teeth are essential to all predators because that's what they use to kill.
And one of the residents in particular will soon need
to be sure his deadly equipment is in perfect working order.
Vidal the leopard was rescued after being caught in a farmer's trap.
Africat returned him to the wild, but he seems to have developed a taste for livestock
and Vidal was soon trapped again by a different farmer.
But now arrangements are being made to move him to a wildlife reserve, well away from any farm.
In a few weeks, he'll be hunting for himself.
But if he's not fully fit and his teeth aren't up to the job, he'll just starve to death.
So today's check up is vital.
But before they can do any of that,
Africat's Dave Houghton has got to catch Vidal in his large and overgrown enclosure
and then knock him out with a tranquilliser dart.
And that's not going to be easy
because leopards are very dangerous indeed.
You can come here.
But if you see a leopard coming, get the hell out of here cos I'm going to be right behind you.
Dave is setting up a box trap in the corner of Vidal's enclosure.
He's probably just laying in there somewhere.
I'm just hoping that I haven't made him angry recently.
OK, that's all I can do now.
I'm very hopeful.
But an animal's an animal and they always do the things you don't expect them to do.
And of all the big cats, that's most true of leopards.
In fact, that's one of the reasons why they're so dangerous.
The cheetah has a lightweight body that's built for speed.
In a short distance sprint, lunch doesn't often get away.
The lion has weight and power.
Combine that with finely tuned teamwork and there's usually something for tea.
But the leopard often kills at night because it must use stealth and cunning to catch its supper.
They hunt alone and strike at close range.
The victim never knows what hit it until it's too late.
But the leopard is also more versatile than the other big cats.
They're adaptable and they learn fast.
So, when Dave comes back an hour later to check on the trap,
he's not really surprised at what's happened.
Well, the box trap is down, the leopard is not in.
It looks like Vidal has reached in and hooked some of the meat out from the back.
Leopards are very clever.
They can sometimes take a long time to catch.
I know that he's foxing me.
But I'm going to win.
Dave is going to reset the trap,
this time with modifications.
I'll put thorn bushes all the way around the back of the trap,
so he can't get the meat from the back or side,
so the only way for him to get it is the front.
And it won't matter that the bait has now been sitting out in the sun for a while.
A leopard goes back to his kill many days after he has killed it, as long as there's some left.
He doesn't mind a few maggots.
So, in fact, it's better if the meat is a little bit smelly.
The bait is attached to a wire that's connected to the door mechanism.
I think he'll be happy grabbing it, until he realises he's trapped.
And then he's going to be quite angry.
Because I know I'm going to get him this time.
Now to position those thorny branches.
And all the while, a vicious leopard could be watching, hiding in the grass just metres away.
If I don't do a good job, I'm wasting my time.
I am trying to do it as quick as possible.
That should work.
It will work if he grabs it.
A leopard restaurant, look.
A bowl of water.
Lump of meat. What more could you ask for?
I'm definitely going to get him this time.
If Vidal doesn't fall for it, he won't get his medical check up and dental exam.
And without them, he can't go to be released into that big wildlife reserve.
If he's not able to hunt for himself, that wouldn't be freedom.
It would be a death sentence.
Life on the plains is hard, but to the west in the Namib Desert, it's merciless.
Today we've come to find some of the wildlife
that survives in this harsh and unforgiving wilderness.
We start with a creature who wouldn't have it any other way
because this is a bird that thrives on death.
A lot of people seem to have got the wrong idea about vultures.
Perhaps it's because they feast on the flesh and entrails of the recently deceased
and even squabble over the juicy bits.
But it's quite unfair   vultures are the refuse collectors of the bush.
They clean up the mess and keep the place tidy.
They're undoubtedly magnificent,
but now I'm about to find out if a vulture could also be cuddly.
The Namibian Vulture Study Group was founded to discover more about these misunderstood birds.
Part of their work is to measure and monitor them,
but just about the only time you can ever get close to a vulture is while it's still very young.
That's because until they've learnt to fly, the babies are naturally docile.
I'm out in the Namib Naukluft Park with former warden, Peter Bridgeford,
who is just coming down this ladder with the most enormous chick! Peter, this is extraordinary.
A lappet faced vulture.
  That's right.
  All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Careful, he's got the largest bill for any bird of prey in the world.
You can get a nasty nip with that.
  I can't believe this is actually a chick, it looks fully grown.
  That's right.
It's a pretty big one, he's getting close to flying.
He must be about three months old.
Look at him, he's a beauty. Absolute beauty.
What sort of stage will he be at in the nest at the moment?
Will he be flexing wings?
Yes, he will be exercising, flapping his wings.
In about 120 days, they fledge and he takes off.
Look at the size of this wing, it's almost the full length of the wing.
Yes, he's a pretty big chick, a nice, long tail.
Look at the size of those claws.
Look at those claws!
We'll put a ring on him. It's part of the ringing programme.
I was going to ask you, why are you dragging chicks out of nests?
It doesn't seem a terribly wise thing to be doing!
Particularly when they're this big.
It's all part of our ringing programme which has been going on for 15 years.
By putting a unique metal ring on it with a number on it,
you can check this bird wherever it goes.
  OK. Do you want me to note down the numbers for you?
  Yes, please. It's G20832.
So, these beaks and claws,
are lappet faced vultures exclusively carrion eaters
or would they actually use these incredible weapons for killing as well?
In times of stress,
there are records where they have attacked domestic stock like sheep.
If a ewe is having problems giving birth,
there are records where they have attacked the lamb
which is having a problem being born
or just after birth.
It's very seldom. There's not many records of that.
But yes, you can't say they will not.
When hunger drives them,
they do things we don't normally expect them to do.
Generally, they eat carrion,
anything from elephants to hares killed on the road.
So, now we're going to measure the wing.
From this, we can determine the age of the bird.
You hold them together like that.
650, that's pretty long.
  You can put it down there for the length of the wing, 650.
An adult wing is just over 700. He's getting close.
You know he's almost there.
The tail is 270.
We've got mass here. Have you got any idea, roughly, how much?
I think we can quickly weigh him.
You put this down so I can put him down in the middle of that.
I'll wrap him up.
This will have to be a makeshift weighing bag.
You get the reading there for me.
I would say that looks like eight and a half, actually.
8.5? OK, that's a pretty big bird.
The average weight for an adult is seven kilograms.
  But what happens, it's like puppy fat.
  Yeah?
It builds up a lot of fat so once it starts flying and it's on its own,
it's already got this reserve in the body.
You hold him. Put your hands underneath and take both feet
so his claws don't hang down.
Otherwise, he'll get you with the claws.
OK, feller, ready?
Get ready for your close up.
That's lovely, isn't it?
He's magnificent! Peter, thank you very much.
So, now we've had a close look at this fine bouncing baby,
it's time to decide   can a vulture ever be cute
or is this a face that only a mother could love?
Back at Africat, a box trap has been set for Vidal the leopard.
He's got to be caught so that he can have a medical check and dental exam.
But so far he's outsmarted Dave Houghton.
To see if he can do it again, we've left a small camera running by the trap.
Here comes Vidal.
He's going in.
Incredibly, he's managed to get a small piece of the bait
without springing the gate.
But he's soon back.
He just can't resist that meat.
Now he's trapped, Vidal needs to be taken to the Africat clinic.
He'll have to be sedated.
Vet Mark Jago is here to do that with a tranquilliser dart fired from his air rifle.
Big boy!
One has to have a lot of respect for a leopard. They're not the same as cheetahs.
They are incredibly quick, very strong, they can get their feet through those bars very easily.
And one doesn't play around with leopards.
They're aggressive animals.
Dave holds the leopard's attention while Mark takes the shot.
I think maybe we should just back off now.
Give him time to settle down.
He won't settle down so much if we stand too close.
Sedating big cats is notoriously tricky.
They've backed off, but are watching closely.
It normally takes about ten minutes.
That's if he's got the full dose and if it's enough.
We won't get him out until he's completely asleep.
He'll be completely asleep before we move him.
You don't want a leopard waking up in the back of the car.
It could be dangerous. It WOULD be dangerous.
It would attack people.
Bite people.
Make a nasty mess of people.
They're not like cheetahs. They won't run away.
They come for you and they're aggressive.
Ten minutes later, Vidal is out for the count.
But when Mark and Dave go in to get him, something is wrong.
He's been sick and that may have blocked his windpipe.
There's a real danger of suffocation.
The equipment they need to deal with this is back at the clinic,
but will they get there in time?
Back in the Namib Naukluft National Park,
it's my turn to seek out another of the desert's great survivors.
It's the world's largest bird.
While they're not common here, they can be found,
as long as you're with someone who knows where to look.
Wilderness guide Felix and I are here
at the only permanent water source in the Namib Naukluft National Park.
Around it are a very impressive number of ostriches.
Felix, presumably they're here to get their daily water quotas, is that right?
  That's right, yes.
  How much water would an ostrich need per day?
Well, minus plus eight litres.
Eight litres in this sort of environment!
That strikes me... Especially as this is the only source of water,
that must be quite a task for them to manage.
No, sure. They also lose a lot of moisture,
through when they do a bit of dropping.
Some of these guys have to walk far.
Most of the other moisture they obtain, they get through plants,
which is very moisturised.
Obviously, we have some males there, the very black ones, aren't they?
  That's right.
  Are there some females as well?
Yes, I saw a few females, but it is more common to see the males during the day.
The females will be lying on the eggs.
They will switch at night time, the males will take over,
because they are black and can attract more heat.
That will give the female a chance to go and feed.
They obviously have these incredibly powerful legs. Can they run fast?
Oh, yes. They can run at a speed of 60 kilometres per hour.
Wow! That is pretty quick.
And the claws on the bottom look quite powerful.
  Apart from using them like we use our feet, would they use them to protect themselves?
  Yes, very much.
Ostrich are very aggressive birds, especially the males.
  They are capable of killing a man.
  How would they do that?
What they'd do is they kick to the front, and then they have a claw,
a thing that almost looks like two toes, one short and one long.
This long one is a claw that can actually cut through you.
And presumably quite a powerful kick?
By looking at the length of it, yes, he will kick you.
I have to ask, the one image I always had as a child of an ostrich is with its head buried in the ground.
Is that truth or myth?
That's a myth. It's not true.
  They don't do it?
  They are not really smart birds but they don't bury their heads in the sand.
There's nothing really going on upstairs.
It's a very funny bird, even by looking at the structure. They are not very smart.
Well, Felix, thank you very much for sharing your knowledge with me.
Pleasure's all mine.
Back at Africat, Vidal the leopard has been rushed to the clinic.
He was sick after being knocked out with a tranquilliser dart.
If it happens again, he could easily suffocate on his own vomit.
The vet, Mark Jago, must intubate to keep the airway safe.
That means inserting a plastic pipe down the throat, through the larynx
and right into the top of the bronchial tube itself.
Now everyone can breathe easy, especially Vidal.
In a few weeks' time, Vidal is due to be moved to a wildlife reserve
where he will need to hunt for himself.
Now, Mark and Gerhard must find out if he's fit enough to survive.
If he has got any abnormalities, we are reluctant to relocate him to a new place.
We only like relocating healthy, normal cheetahs.
If there is an abnormality...
Leopards or cheetahs.
If there is an abnormality with any animal, we will not relocate them
until we are perfectly happy with them.
Gerhard Steenkamp is a top specialist,
a wildlife dentist with particular expertise in big cats.
Straight away, he's spotted a big problem.
One of Vidal's canines is dead inside.
These are 55 millimetres.
In a cat of this size, it just disappears into the canal.
It looks like the problem started some time ago after the tip of the tooth was damaged.
These are these animals' tools,
so it could well have been when she was still wild, catching prey.
That can happen. If they catch an antelope, animals will kick and roll around.
There is always a chance that trauma can happen.
This tooth will have been causing pain
and would definitely stop Vidal from functioning in the wild.
Gerhard needs to smooth the tooth down
and do some serious root canal work.
It's a big job and is going to take some time.
I have worked with leopards before.
We did this procedure on the teeth
and, a couple of months later, saw them on the kill.
We know that if we take it out, they definitely will struggle a lot more
than if we leave them something.
There's still quite a lot of length left on this tooth.
So, she's got virtually three pretty healthy canines
and then there will be that one which is more like a stump.
So while Gerhard gets on with that,
Mark carries out the rest of Vidal's health check.
You can see he's got a bit of soreness on his left front leg.
It's probably from being in the box trap now. It's not serious.
It's always a problem when you catch them, you have to catch them in box traps.
They can always do injury to themselves
and with wild animals, it can be fairly serious.
With these animals which have been kept in captivity, it's less of a risk.
We get them out of the box traps fast.
The small injury should soon heal
and Mark can't find any other problems.
But the dental work takes longer
and it's well after dark before it's finally finished.
I'm impressed, Gerhard! They look nice.
Neat job.
Almost as good as new.
Vidal's now been under sedation for almost three hours
and pretty soon the drugs are going to start to wear off.
Let's load him up and take him back home.
Mark and Dave need to get Vidal back to his enclosure before he wakes up.
They don't want to give him the chance to try out his newly repaired teeth quite yet.
Back in the Namib Naukluft National Park,
Kate's out with wilderness guide Felix in search of more desert wildlife.
There are parts of this region where it hasn't rained in years,
so anything you find out here is a real survivor.
We've just spotted a herd of gemsbok, or oryx, which is their general name.
Gemsbok is a local name, isn't it, for this particular antelope?
They're all under a tree, it's incredibly hot.
We're right in the middle of the day.
This is a standard way, presumably, for these animals to cope
with the extreme heats they get in this area of Namibia?
That's right. Up here it can get up to 45 degrees, even more.
It gets so hot that these guys are forced to move under the trees to take cover.
You do quite often see a lone male.
  Is he holding on to a territory like wildebeest do?
  That's right.
What happens is, basically, he needs to hold this territory
and make sure there is water, if it's available, and enough food.
During the mating season, he will bring in a herd of females
and he will be very protective over these females.
You mentioned water, which is something you don't see a lot of around here.
In fact, I haven't seen any standing water at all.
How does an animal like the oryx cope with so little water?
One of the ways is to eat succulent plants,
which it will dig up with its legs.
It will also save the moisture in its body
by excreting droppings without any moisture.
We've got some of them here.
Basically, what will they will do, is if they eat anything, a succulent plant,
something with a lot of moisture on,
none of that moisture will then get into the droppings,
the droppings will be completely dry
and they manage to store the moisture in their bodies.
That's right. They will keep that back and leave the solid droppings.
If I break this one, if I can...
You have managed.
This is only grass, you can see. There's hardly any moisture.
And they squeeze this out.
God, yeah, it is completely packed down.
And they don't sweat or do they?
When they are standing in the sun without any shade,
they will increase their body temperature.
They allow their body temperature to get really high
so that they don't lose moisture?
They are holding on to the moisture from the food?
  That's right.
  That's extraordinary.
And then presumably, in the cool of the night, the temperature drops back to normal?
That's right. What they also do is, they do not move a lot.
They will be standing still for most of the day and they will only be grazing later in the afternoon.
That's also just to prevent moisture loss.
So, how long can they go before it becomes dangerous for them, without drinking at all?
Like I say, they obtain this moisture from the plants,
but if water is available, they will drink,
but they can go for months without drinking water.
It's absolutely fascinating. Felix, thank you very much indeed.
Back in Africat, it's been a long day.
Vidal the leopard has had major dental work
and he's been under sedation for over three hours.
But now vet Mark Jago and Africat's Dave Houghton
carry him back into the enclosure.
He's done well. We've finished.
It's about seven o'clock in the evening now.
He is sleeping soundly still.
We're going to give him a reversal
so he wakes up within the next 30 minutes or so
and then we'll take the drip off and take the pipes out.
He's stable, he's in good condition.
It was just the teeth that were a problem. We've sorted those. Gerhard's done a good job.
And it's time for him to wake up.
I'm very happy that he's got the vet's seal of approval.
I'm now going to feel a lot better when he goes and starts hunting for himself.
I know his teeth can handle the job.
It's a good feeling that he's all fixed up.
Every day, Mark deals with all sorts of wildlife.
But there's no denying it   leopards are special.
It's a privilege to work with them.
They are very impressive creatures, they are very beautiful creatures.
They are creatures which, I've said before, one has to be aware of
as they are aggressive but they are definitely majestic animals.
I'm just going to give the reversal now, pop it in the back leg.
There we are. He will be sitting up within a few minutes.
And in a few weeks, he will be off to his new home in a wildlife reserve.
Thanks to the work that's been done today, Vidal should be ready to survive out in the wild.
Kate and I are warming ourselves around this fire,
safely back at camp in the Namib Naukluft Park with wilderness guide Felix.
Felix, am I right in assuming that because we're about to go to bed,
all the animals will be doing the same thing?
No, as a matter of fact, you are wrong.
There is nocturnal animals.
Such as the Cape fox, black backed jackal, spotted hyena
and a few snakes.
Thanks, that makes me feel great(!)
We are going to sleep well!
Hopefully, we will make it through to the morning, but that's all we have time for today.
Here's what's coming up on the next Wild In Africa.
A mystery disease threatens to kill every jackal on the Skeleton Coast.
We've had reports and we've also seen first hand a lot of mortalities
around the colony in particular.
Sun, sand and survival  
it's amazing that anything can live in a place like this.
Sometimes in the desert, the temperatures go up to 70 degrees Celsius.
You can fry an egg on it.
  On the sand?
  On the sand.
  Really?
And he's very fast and highly poisonous.
But what really makes the sidewinder scary is this...
We'll have all that and more on the next Wild In Africa.
