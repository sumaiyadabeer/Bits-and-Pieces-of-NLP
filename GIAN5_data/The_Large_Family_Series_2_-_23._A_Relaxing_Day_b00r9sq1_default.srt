And a bottle of washing up liquid.
Will that be all?
Yes, I think so, for the moment.
Well, thank you.
That'll be Â£46.80, Mrs Large.
And here, just for you, is a special voucher.
They're for my extra special customers.
Oh, a voucher. For what? A day at the Pacific Lagoon. Oh!
That sounds very exotic.
The children will be really pleased with this.
No, no, it's for you.
It's to try out Pacific Lagoon, the brand new spa in town.
This is a free one day pass.
How exciting!
A spa, Linda?
What exactly do you do in a spa?
Erm, well, there's a swimming pool
and relaxing bubble baths, for a start.
And you can also have a lovely relaxing massage
and drink delicious fresh fruit juices, packed with vitamins.
Oh, it sounds fantastic, Mum.
Can I come with you...please?
Oh, I'm sorry, Laura, only adults are allowed.
  Oh!
  Don't worry, Laura,
we'll find lots of fun things to do together
while your mum's at the spa.
Oh, yes, I'm sure you will.
And I'll enjoy a lovely relaxing day. Oh, I can't wait!
La la la la...
  Oh...
  Is everything to your liking, madam?
Yes, thank you.
The juice and the bath, oh...!
  Heaven...
  Oh, I don't know what this place is coming to.
How unprofessional! No one has brought me a bathrobe.
Oh!
Well, Mrs Smart, I'm so sorry.
I shall bring you a robe immediately.
Thank you. I hope you won't be long.
Oh, and tell me, my neighbour Mrs Large
is supposed to be here today, have you seen her anywhere?
Why, yes, I think she's in the steam bath at this very moment.
Thank you. Oh, the poor thing, it's her first time here, you know,
and she'll need some guidance.
Oh, honestly, no sign of Mrs Large here.
These beauticians don't know their trunks from their tails!
  Oh!
  Have you lost something, dear?
Erm, my swimming cap...I think.
  I don't think you had one on.
  Oh, of course.
I really am losing my head!
What's the matter, sis? You look like you're miles away.
I am. I'm at the spa...with Mum.
Poor Laura! Still dreaming about a bubble bath, eh?
Yup, I so wish I could be there. It sounded great.
I know, I've got a really cool idea.
Why don't we make one right here?
Where?
Here, in the garden. We've got a paddling pool and some bubble bath.
  That should do the trick.
  Excellent idea, Lester.
  Fantastic, yeah, that'd be great!
  Yeah!
Ah, there it is.
It's got to be quite old, but still...
Yep, it's old, all right. And it's not made of plastic.
That's because it's not a paddling pool, it's a tent.
Oh, yes, of course.
Oh, dear, I remember now.
The paddling pool got a puncture last year
and we had to throw it away.
  All we kept was the box.
  Oh.
Does that mean we won't be able to do our spa?
Of course not. Sebastian's got a paddling pool,
we could borrow that.
Linda, yoo hoo!
It's me, Sheena. Are you there?
Linda?
Hello, Lester.
I'm sorry, Sebastian's not in, he's at his trombone lesson.
OK, but, erm, actually,
we were coming about something else.
Actually, we were planning to set up a little spa in our garden.
We thought it would be fun for Laura.
A spa?
Yes, the thing is, we need to borrow your plastic paddling pool.
Would you mind?
Of course not.
Brilliant!
But...
Our pool is of extremely high quality, the best that money can buy.
It was made from the same plastic they use in spaceships.
And I will have to be here at all times, while you use it.
Yoo hoo, Linda.
Where are you?
I'm going to be more exhausted than when I started, at this rate.
Ah, Mrs Large.
You've come to the right place.
You'll see, the icy water jets will relax you beautifully.
Really? Are you sure about this?
Oh, dear me, why ever did I think this would be fun?
Oh oh oh, so cold, oh!
Oh, no, sorry. No bubble bath in there.
You could damage the plastic pool walls.
  Hmm!
  Sorry, Lester,
no parasols either, I'm afraid. I don't want any holes in my lawn.
Oh, that's not fair.
Luke, no mats either, they'd squash my lovely plump grass.
This is no fun!
Perhaps you could play in your own garden.
Your father can stay and help me inflate the pool
and we'll call you when we're ready.
No yellow ducks...
Well, a plastic duck can't do much damage, I suppose.
This spa idea is the worst in the world. We can't do anything.
Without Sebastian, we'll never persuade Mr Smart to have fun.
It doesn't matter, forget about Mr Smart's pool.
  We'll make our own spa at home.
  Yeah, but what with?
With Lucy's old bathtub.
N n nobody on the horizon.
OK... OK, here I go.
Oh, no sign of Sheena.
Oh, good, I can go.
Hoo hoo!
  Oh ho ho...
  Oh, Linda, I've found you at last.
I see you're making the most of the spa.
I've been looking for you. What have you been up to?
Erm, isn't the pool a little too full already?
It might make the plastic split.
Course not!
Your plastic thingummy's quite solid, isn't it?
The latest in space technology.
I'm not sure we blew it up enough...
Or maybe too much.
Oh, the water's stopped. There must be a problem.
Of course there isn't. I turned the water off.
  The pool was about to overflow.
  Thank you.
  Luke, Lester, it's ready!
  Oh!
Well, I'm ready. How about you, girls?
So are we.
Look what I found. We don't have the pool,
but we do have a pump for blowing bubbles.
Try and relax, Mrs Large.
You'll get more out of it if you do.
So I gave her a piece of my mind.
What a cheek, pushing in front of me like that.
How's the massage going, Linda? Delightful, isn't it?
Yes, erm, y yes.
Well, anyway, right, I think it's time I got back home.
My husband and my children will be waiting for me.
And I can't wait to see them.
You're absolutely right.
All this chatting, but time is getting on.
I'm in the car, I can drive you home.
Coming in, Larry?
Water's lovely and warm. Tell your children to come in too.
Oh, no, I'm going with them.
They've got a really good spa going over there.
It's fun and very user friendly.
Oh!
Your spa is absolutely wonderful, kids.
Ah, yeah, except the bathtub's absolutely tiny.
A real paradise!
AIR HISSES What's happening?
Mum! So was your day at the spa good?
Well, not quite as good as I'd have imagined.
I'm really happy to be back home again.
Oh, my goodness, what on earth is going on here?
The neighbours and I decided to make a spa here at home, in the garden.
Great!
Erm, yeah... No, not really. It didn't quite go to plan.
But it's no big deal, the lawn and flowers did need a bit of water!
Huh!
That's such a cool spa.
  Can I go?
  Of course you can, son, I'll come with you.
Like this? Does this feel nice?
Oh, yeah, it's wonderful!
Oh, oh, that tickles!
