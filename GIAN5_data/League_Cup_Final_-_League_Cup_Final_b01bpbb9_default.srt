They have been playing for this trophy in Northern Ireland for 118
years, and today it is the turn of Coleraine and Crusaders to try and

Ballymena Showground. The weather is chilly and frosty, but a great
atmosphere starting to build for this, the second cup final of the
season. Good afternoon and welcome to live coverage of the Irn Bru
League Cup. We are all looking forward to what we hope will be a
cracking Cup final. Joining me in the studio, two men who know all
about winning local football silverware, Marty Quinn and Chris
Morgan. Good to see you both. What do you think of the venue for the
game today? Good choice? I've think so. It suits both sides. It is
halfway between Belfast and Coleraine. The stadium looks the
part and they have been able to house the extra Coleraine fans.

team's fans. Coleraine fans are very confident. It was a good
location, 50 50 for both clubs. Rather than bringing it to Belfast,
should look well. A la Sky 1 Coleraine were winning silverware

memories? Those memories never fade. I am actually someone with a bit of
a Crusaders blood and a long association with Cliftonville, but
with the experience that the crews have had, winning a few trophies
and have been competing hard for the lead, they might have the edge
on a young and very fast maturing Coleraine side. I am delighted for
them. I would love them to win the Cup today, but I think it might be
a bit too early for them. The only time these teams have met in the
final before was here in 1996, the League Cup final. The last time
Crusaders won the competition was the same year, 1996. Chris, you
were in the squad that day. It has been a while since you pulled on
your boots, but good memories. Absolutely. I remember the game. I
would have been starting to break into the squad. I was about 20
years old.    you were about 20 years old. You do the maths. Out of
the blue, they came into the final and it was the first time we saw
some players, and might chance was gone and Patrick Donnelly scored
the winner.    my chance. Coleraine have been scoring some spectacular
goals and have been on a great run, unbeaten in 13. This was one of the
best they scored. Johnny Black from inside his own half. An
unbelievable effort. Then last week, is in. Paul Owens. Direct from the
corner. He wasn't content to do it once, he did it twice and nearly
did it a third time. Yes, a little bit of luck, but Coleraine are on a
good run at the moment and playing The manager said he had been lucky
up to now. When you score goals like that, in a gale force winds,
lo and behold, he was caught out twice which was uncharacteristic of
David, but the conditions added to that. He made a couple of great
saves on the day as well. Coleraine are a team without fear, they are
young with a young manager. They are not afraid to have a pop.
Johnny Black's goal showed that the goalkeeper when one to watch them
again, but they were caught out and should not have been caught out in
those positions. Do you think Crusaders experience will count.
Colin Coates making his three hundreds appearance. He has been a
key player for them. As Marty Quinn said, Crusaders have been pushing
at the top end of the league for a few years and have been in cup
finals and maybe just had a bit of extra big game experience. You talk
about Colin Coates and he was a big threat from set pieces. I think he
was    has scored eight goals this season. Good going for a centre
half. The guy beside him, Paul Leeman, so much experience. Stuart
Dallas is a really exciting player and one we all like watching. You
can see his pace here and his eye for goal. He is a player I would
like to see in a more central position. I fancy might come in off
the left, but I would like to see him getting close to the forwards
and making the third man runs the on the strikers. While the Irish
League and the Irish Cup may be the most coveted titles in local
football, but this competition has prestige. The cup was presented 100
years ago as the City Cup and this is what it meant to Tommy Wright
when he led Lisburn Distillery to the Cup last year. To winning last
season was brilliant for me. As you can see from the celebrations, I
lost control. A wonderful, wonderful feeling. I put so much
hard work into it and to achieve the silverware was great. I'm sure
the lads might not celebrate in the way I did, but they will be
extremely delighted if they can get their hands on the Cup. Both
Coleraine and Crusaders have only won the League Cup once before and
memories of those victories are fresh for them. But the men in
charge of today's teams want to create their own bit of local
football history. It are the views, past and present    here are the
I was meant to be away with a steel band, but I ended up playing in the
final. It went to extra time and it was deep in the second half of
extra time that it was probably the only chance in the whole game and
it fell, and he hated, the keeper saved it and I had it the second
time a, and I got it. Anybody who scores the winning in this final
will definitely be a daughter in Coleraine.    will definitely be a

and been brilliant and they went on some good runs this season and I
was really happy with the quarter  final victory. We just hope the
players can push on another step to see if we can go a stage further
We had a bit of a crisis up front, and Paddy came, and unknown to many,

League Cup here this afternoon? Chris, for you? I just fancy that
Crusaders might have the experience. Both of their games in the league
have been draws, so possibly extra time, but my fancy his Crusaders.
Your heart says Coleraine, but your head says Crusaders? Let's not
forget the job Stephen Baxter's has done. He came is as    as a young
manager and got his act together quickly and was successful with
Irish cops. He has always been around the top four in the league.
I think that experience has served them well. They have a solid back
four. The centre of the team are strong. Jordan Owens and David
Rainey, he is a predator, he could be picking up the pieces. Curtis
Allen could score if Crusaders switch off. I would give Crusaders
the edge. We shall see. It is cold, but is certainly colourful at the

people. We were privileged to be in a cracking game last year. This
year we are down here and it is a credit to both clubs in terms of
the number of supporters, particularly Coleraine. Oran

tickets Santa packed the ground makes for a super atmosphere.
certainly does. The teams are making their entrance. Crusaders in
their familiar red and black, a pinstripe, really. The pinstripe of
macro Colraine    Coleraine. They are sleeping giants. They are
unbeaten in their last 13 games. They come here in good form.
Crusaders are unbeaten in their last five though. Impressive form.
There is the temporary stand. The Crusaders fans on the left as you
look at them. About 1,200 Crusaders fans coming to this game and that
small temporary stand, and we have something like 2,500 supporters
here. It is always sad to me, because the average home crowd for
Coleraine has been 933 and here we have 2,500. Where are they every
Saturday? That is the question we all ask. Personally, I champion the
Irish League because we produce a great product. We play some
fantastic football and I don't know whether he maybe this day and age
we are spoiled with Sky Television, and people seek their pleasures
elsewhere, whether it is in England or Scotland. But you see this
turnout today and it is phenomenal. But I do think the supporters want
to watch successful teams, who played good, decent football, and
in Crusaders and Coleraine, you have that product. There we have
the presentations. There is the marketing manager for iron brew   
the Irn Bru League Cup sponsors. His grandfather was a player fought
Coleraine when they were founded in 1920. He might not be impartial in
that case. A big day for the sponsor. This is what I love about
the modern game. It is how we involve young kids. Interesting to
note, look at that. A lovely picture. When you are talking about
getting fans back in the game, that is exactly how you do it, you bring
them along as young kids, induct them and get them to love the game
and their club. That is a fantastic shot. What was surprising and
interesting was coming through the Coleraine supporters, the number of
families here today. This is not a male dominated audience by any
stretch. Let us pause for the off a manner of minutes away.

target cell we say    shall we say. It is one of those way you take
your chance and a burst the back of the net and you are a world beater
or it can go embarrassingly over the bar. That was one of those
embarrassing ones. Chris Morrow with five goals this season, none
in the League Cup. A few people wanting to make their mark, and
this would be the perfect day to do it. The boys in the studio were
tucking about Crusaders having more there to be. I think young David
went down a little bit theatrically. A little bit too easy. Earlier on
today, QPR were playing Chelsea and Chelsea got a very soft penalty,
but I don't think there was any way Canning got his first goal for the
club. He shimmied past a couple of defenders and really hammered it in.
And he celebrated. It was one to nothing.    ball in many ways, but
Curtis Allen really busted his neck to get it down. That is good
forward play. Really good team play. Having watched Coleraine last week,
Oran Kearney has brought a work ethic to the side because they
worked all over the pitch. You can be as talented as you are, but if
it is not accompanied by honest, hard work then talent is worked   
wish to disagree with Stephen Watson, the Colin Coates is one
short of the landmark, it is his talking to me, and we will argue
about this after. I think there was a little nudge. Yes, Johnny Black
coming off the worst from Jordan Owens. Johnny, who scored a
spectacular goal at the start of their voice around us. Both sides
around us have a hundred % records at this venue. Coleraine came in
September and thumped their biggest rivals 5 1. Crusaders won here
three 0 and then 1 0 in the semi  final of the League Cup. While
we're waiting for the free kick, isn't it brilliant to be here and
the way the supporters are creating a fantastic atmosphere. A hope that
viewers will enjoy our presentation today. Let's hope we see a few
goals as well. The little bit of pressure coming from Coleraine,
forcing Colin Coates to give away don't like a long ball forward, but
it can cause problems. A pretty innocuous one and they seem to be a
lack of communication between the but it in region. Johnny Black did
brilliantly there. He really did. McMaster was lurking, and a great
interception. Black has missed a few games because of a groin injury,
but they will glad to welcome him back. I am still not sure why he
was released by one club, as he almost gave up the game at the end
of last season. He is a great talent, he really is. Like you, I
am surprised he was allowed to leave, but sometimes these things
happen. He took it on the chin, picked himself up and Oran Kearney
made a very astute signing. He is not just a decent defender, he is a
good passer of the ball and in terms of free kicks he scored a
rasping free kick the other week. So, a good, a talented all round
window.    winger. Crusaders get played the ball to Curtis Allen.
There could be danger here. Gareth McKeown has done very well. Stood
over on that side. But a bit of style there. You would give your
right arm for that. Yes, he was many years ago. Maybe not that
collar. Maybe not.    that colour. I remember your long blonde hair in
the modelling days when you on the catwalk. I have been hammered in
the past week. Friends of mine, who Why will not name, I think there is

They are defensively sound. Athletically, they are very good.
In terms of the tactical side of trained this morning and Philip was
asking how long we would go on because he wanted to come down and
support his brother. I thought it was a cracking touched. He will be
another Coleraine supporter. Blood is thicker than water. There is Mr
Baxter, hoping something comes from though. That must be frustrating
for the manager and the rest of the players, particularly the defenders
who had made their way up. Jordan Owens has done so well. Stuart
Gallas! I thought that was going in the top corner. So inventive, so
much pace. He saw the chance and he took it first time. Two seconds ago
I was going to criticise him. But like a flash, the ball is clear
there, he is so quick. He had to take it first time because he was
being closed down by the defender. That was a great piece of
opportunism. David Ogilby did just aerial battles up front. I'm sure
that will not have escaped Oran Kearney. David Scullion gets it

could not meet a nicer fellow. has committed his whole career to
know he was disappointed to leave a Coleraine but, the true gentleman
that he is, he simply got up and got on with it and he is doing
tremendously well for Crusaders. Stephen Baxter knew what he was
buying, that is for sure. Proven goods. Crusaders. Coleraine tried
to get forward. Twice they have played deceive   season and twice
it has been a stalemate. We have had two goals in two games. I hope
it is more exciting than that today for our viewers. When that free
kick was taken, Curtis Allen was about four yards from the ball.
players just have not settled yet. I am not making excuses for them.
The pitch is not great. There is that nervous energy and passes are
being misplaced at the moment. It will settle down. There is too much
talent out there not to give us a good game. If I still think they
are rushing things and snatching things. They need to play their
normal game but it is easier said than done. There is a lot at stake
here, plus the ï¿½10,000 for the winners, plus the trophy, plus a
place in next season's said Tanter forward. Gareth McKeown. We know a
game changes every time and a goal can change any game. Gareth McKeown
dealt with that superbly. Good slick passing. All the way through
to David Rainey. Curtis Allen gets away from Aidan Watson. How this is
good from Curtis Allen. A little cross. He will feel he was being
pulled it there. But there was not enough minute to give anything.
Curtis Allen was a very fortunate. Certainly the offence took place
outside the box. Aidan Watson was lucky. The referee tried to play a
good advantage. They now get a free No one could get a vital touch. A
smile from Stephen Baxter. Maybe one of relief. It was a decent ball
in. Shane Jennings was a peculiar. Here we have the the free kick.
Good work by Curtis Allen. Shane Jennings just mistimed his jump.
push forward. 20 minutes gone in this final and we still wait for
the first goal. When we get that beating the first man and that
really infuriates the manager. When there is a needless free kick given
away. David Rainey is a real competitor but when you are in an
area where you are looking to press the ball, what you don't want to do
is give a cheap free kick away. David Rainey, the great man that he
is, will be 36 in April. He has got three goals in the last four games.
There he is. Three in the last four games. David is a real credit to
the game, given his longevity. A very talented player and he still
has the enthusiasm of a 17 year old. Curtis Allen. A low ball in. The
'keeper claims it. He will have a few nerves in his first senior
final. He moved to Crusaders last summer. Gareth McKeown. David O
well be.   David Ogle the. pitch is not helping. I think the
nervous tension is not helping either. The one thing I have got to
say, it is certainly competitive. Just on cue. It was competitive
there from Chris Morrow. That might be a yellow card for coming through
from the back. Chris is competitive and combative and I don't think he
left the referee with any option there. I don't think so. I don't
think he can have too many complaints. There was no attempt to
hit anybody, he is just competitive. He just wanted to make his mark, so
to speak. I was going to say before that happened, we have not seen
enough of Gareth Tommons. He and Stephen Lowry are playing mainly
from back to front. If they get those two involved more, they might
have more success. I have talked about the ability of both boys and
they are both great footballers but it is not really going through
midfield. It is very direct at the moment. Both defences are very much
on top and dominating. An old head on a 21 year old's shoulders,
doubt, if we're replay this, but I cannot understand why goalkeepers
are protected. It is a long kick forward. Curtis Allen is trying to
come for the ball. He just goes for the ball. I don't think that is a
foul. I am not sure I agree with you. I think he was looking for the
goalkeeper as well. Possibly. I just like the competitive nature of
the game and I think goalkeepers are over protected. I am not
arguing with you there. Gareth McKeown with a this throw in. Here
he is again. Paul Leeman. David That is the first time Gareth
Tommons has really got on the ball. That afflicted not really workout.
  that flick. Colin Coates very quick to read the situation. That
was well spotted by the referee. No doubt there was a push. That was
nice to see, at the referee smiling. It is not all smiling   pressure.
The idea was right. A great run by David Rainey, but unfortunately the
that younger team. That is a great tackle by Howard Beverland. And it
had to be. Excellent defending. That is a quite superb tackle.
There are people who enjoy great passes and a great goals but, as a
former defender, I enjoy great tackles. There was no room for
error. If it was, it was a penalty. Well done, that young man. It is
hard to believe he is only 21. He seems to have been around for a
long time. One of the outstanding central defenders in the Irish
League, I can tell you. I will not read anything into that. I just
like central defenders because I was one. And you have a preview of
the team you will play on Tuesday. Yes, and we know it is going to be
tough. We have a Coleraine on Tuesday and Crusaders on Saturday.
As well as enjoying today, it gives me a chance to see both sides other
close and personal. You have got a nice lead at the top but it can be
whittled away in the blink of an eye so you cannot take anything for
granted. A long ball in. Aaron Canning put him under great
pressure. The striker had no chance. A touch of hands between the two
men involved. We need a goal, David. We do, Jack. Coleraine are trying
to get it down but again, the passes are going astray. We have no
real rhythm at the moment. Coleraine fans are still up for it
though. He that is the fantastic thing about it. They are creating a
fantastic atmosphere and giving their team every encouragement.
Colin Coates. That looked alright to me but the Coleraine fans did
not like his challenge. Shane Jennings. He was unselfish, trying
to find Curtis Allen, but it did not workout. Stuart Gallas gets it
forward. There is the pace of Stuart Gallas. He has got Jordan
Owens in the middle. Here is Chris Morrow. That hit a hand. That is a
great shout from the referee because the ball just bounced up
and hit him. There is nothing he could have done it. There was no
intention. The danger is not over. But plenty of blue and white shirts
there, defending in numbers and doing it well. A great tackle from
Chris Morrow. The ball just comes up. Looking at that again, maybe
there is a. There. But that is in slow motion. When it happened, I
did not think it was a penalty. If you were on the opposition bench,
you would be of your seat, wanting it. Stuart Gallas. David Rainey.
Jordan Owens tries to stay onside. That is straight into the
is not really working out as yet. Hence a stalemate and hence a not a
very exciting or good game at the moment. It is not, Jack, I have got
to agree with you there. Not much of the football has been played
through the middle of the park. It has all been very direct. The
defences are definitely on top. David Scullion made a run but it
did not get to him. He did well to McIlmoyle. If you studs showing but
his foot was not there. It was not really dangerous. Once again, the
ball back to front and given away. And that is repeated. Curtis Allen.
He did not have had that touch on that occasion. Gavin Cullen, just
his 10th appearance of the season. Took over when Michael Doherty was

have gone in this first half. does. To be fair to David, he is a

organising that extra seating. I have said many times that health
and safety is of paramount importance but it can be draconian
and it is killing the game. But it has allowed us a good attendance
today. It was a good move. Congratulations to a couple of
Coleraine businessmen who funded it so that the fans could beer in

looking for the run in. Only David Rainey in the middle. No chance of

Jennings. Aaron Canning delivers. Gareth McKeown did well. Strong in
the air. Johnny Black can hit them and he certainly had that one Welsh.
Not easy to do with the new balls. Most people would say that is an
idiotic shot but when you have got a shot like Johnny Black, go ahead
son and have a go. I think he was further away from the goal when he
scored that fantastic effort at the beginning of the season. He was in
the opposition half at this time. Here is the break and Jordan Owens.
It is Chris Morrow, in fact. Chris Morrow made the break. I was
looking at the replay. Crusaders have struck. 34 minutes gone. The
delight beginning to show, I think. But Chris Morrow, his first goal in
this League Cup campaign. The through ball, there was never any
doubt he was finishing it. The fans in the temporary stand from
Coleraine are silenced. exquisite pass. We deduce   just
did not see it from Stuart Gallas. Look at that.   Stuart Gallas. A
superb pass. And when he had to do the business, he did it with aplomb.
Just what we needed. A goal. Now we have got a cup final, now we have
main grandstand have gone very bit of attention. It was a Ryan
McIlmoyle. But he is ready to go. Just a precaution to make sure
there is no blood flowing. Crusaders are in the box seat
courtesy of Chris Morrow. A level header from Jordan Owens. David
McMaster. Jordan Owens had the chance. Coleraine are on the ropes
all of a sudden. Chris Morrow almost had his second of the day.
That would have been a telling goals. Coleraine has got to regroup
quickly. Aidan Watson. That is a way off Howard Beverland at for the
corner. David McMaster picks it up and a great dummy but then he
reacts to again. It is a good save from Gavin Cullen. Jordan Owens
will feel he should have done better when that ball came in the
Coates. He has dragged it wide. It is hard to believe for the big
defender has gone nine goals this season. Perhaps he should have had
Number 10. I don't think there is any doubt of that, Jack. The
goalkeeper did not know where he was. The ball drops and he will be
very disappointed because he can strike the ball very well. That
should be bulging in the back of the net. As for Gavin Cullen, he
will be mightily relieved. He was punching fresh air. All of a sudden,
that is the problem. Howard Beverland keeps his eye on that.
He was looking at the man, not the ball. The referee is just saying,
you know what you're doing. Don't give me any abuse, particularly on
television. It is a nice complex here at the Ballymena Showgrounds.
It is the third time of the Cup final has been outside Belfast. It
does add to the atmosphere. The crowd are tense to get a bit lost
in the bigger stadiums. Coleraine try to hit back. It is a long throw.
The goalkeeper, Sean O'Neill, was decisive. A great custodian at.
Crusaders got him from done Gannon and he is very assured. He has
played every game this season so he is doing something right. Stuart
Gallas trying to take on Aaron Canning. The pressure is all from
half. The goalkeeper with an easy little bit isolated there.
Coleraine has been forced deep in it is easy for us to spot. Stuart
Gallas. He has quality, pace and power. At the end man who is the
reigning junior player of the Year. He just glides across the surface.
By his own admission, this year has not been as dynamic as last year,
but a superb a player. I think teams now know what to expect from
him. They have certainly worked him out but he is still a talented
player who can hurt you. He is not just good going forward, he is
defensively sound. He helps his full back out a lot. And he is
still just 20 years old. He could make career across the Channel
and one before half time would be very welcome, psychologically it
for Gareth Tommons, the 22 year old in his farewell appearance before
he departs for Australia. You hit the nail on the head.
Psychologically it would be a great lift for Coleraine. That is a
decent effort. But it did not trouble the goalkeeper in the end.
The goalkeeper had it covered, looked like a late challenge.   
play on. I will agree with you, that was a free kick. I don't know
decent ball back. It needed a good defensive header to clear the
would be a second goal for Crusaders. Crusaders would know if
they went two goals up just before half time there would be near
not often it does, but it did on Owens not getting the ball, but he
was going to make the defender work hard, and he has got his team in a
Dallas, once again. That is what he is capable of. That is why he has
got 10 goals this season. He really thump it. Increasingly his
influence is getting stronger. A great through ball for the goal,
and that is a half decent effort. We are now into time added on in
David? I think Stephen Baxter will be pleased to be a goal up. He will
be very happy with his defence, who have not given Coleraine a chance
and he would want to see more of the same. I think Coleraine have
maybe got to try and get more of the ball in the last third where
they have not trouble the defence. And I think going back to front
does not suit them. They may be need to get the ball into wider
only one goal, that man providing it after 34 minutes, Chris Morrow,
his six of the season and his first in the Irn Bru League Cup campaign,
but how important it could be. Congratulated by Declan Caddell.
Half time, a lot of talking to be done by both managers, but mainly
Oran Kearney. The Bannsiders but no real appeal. Here is the
break, Jordan Owens! It is Chris Stephen Baxter, one ahead, should
you be further ahead? We should be two goals up. We have done well and
kept the game alive and pushed forward and created the chances.
Stuart Dallas had a good chance, and it might have been a penalty.
It does seem to indicate you had a call, but it is a big call for the
referee. It is a big one, especially to the referee. But I
think we have done well in the Chris Morgan and Marty Quinn have
been watching the first half. Crusaders deservedly does? I think
in the first half hour it was fairly even. Neither team was
totally dominant, but Crusaders started to look threatening from
the goal and maybe they are disappointed they did not extend
lead, but they are good value to be it in the lead at the break. As an
occasion, fantastic, but for the first half hour of the game, a bit
of a damp squib and still crusader started to stamp their authority on
the game.    until Crusaders. think Chris Morrow was gradually
dominating the midfield. Coleraine giving him too much freedom. Gareth
Tommons was having to sacrifice his own game to stop Chris Morrow, but
Crusaders deserve to be in front. Coleraine have not penetrated the
defence. Curtis Allen has got down the left a couple of times, got to
the near post, but there is no one to be seen. Jennings might have
made a few runs to the post. But Chris Morrow was influencing the
game and then scored the goal and with Howard Beverland, they have
been the two best players. Let's have a look at the goal. A well 
worked move and a good finish. it could build up for the goal. A
long ball, the goalkeeper kicked it out and they get a knock. The great
ball in their and a lot of composure, keeping his head.
Committed the goalkeeper and got it past him. That put Crusaders into
the lead, which they deserved. did well to keep him on side as
well. I think the key thing for Coleraine defensively is there is
no midfield player close to Chris Morrow. He has been like a third
centre forward almost. Dallas plays it instinctively, a perfect weight.
When you get into those situations you can be put off by the keeper
coming out but he keeps a close to the keeper's body and that can be
difficult for the keeper to make a save. Gavin Cullen gets a bit on
edge, but not enough to keep it out. Chris Morrow has got involved a lot
and onto the ball. He has been the best player on the park for the
last 15 or 20 minutes. We have seen him getting on the ball and
gradually getting his confidence levels are. Maybe could have got a
penalty kick. Might have been a bad call, but at the same time they
have been given. 1 0 is probably a fair reflection of the 45 minutes.
Coleraine will have to improve or they will just run out here and not
really remember the game. They have to go out there. No. 1, I would say
to someone, get on Chris Morrow's case and stop him play. Eliminate
Chris Morrow. Let's give it a bit more weeks. They haven't got the
ball wide and the wing there hasn't got the ball at all. They haven't
got to cross into the box, so Coleraine can do a lot better and I
would like to see it otherwise the game is going to run out rather
easily. We do not want the occasion to pass them by. They could have
been more than one 0 down. A couple of great chances to make it two or
three. Yes, the opportunity here, great link up from Jordan Owens. A
lovely cushioned header and he will be disappointed. I don't think he
read the dummy coming in. He has inadvertently played it across the
path of Chris Morrow. I fully expected him to take it into the
back of the net. He has choked it a little bit and hit it into the
ground. Those two opportunities came quickly, close to the goal and
if we had seen a goal that would have been a big ask, but they have
survived a bit of an onslaught and all they need is a chance to get in
amongst the players and to address the things that have been going
wrong. Marty said they had not got it going wide, and I think Curtis
Allen is the key player. His movement has been good and he has
caused some problems, but just not getting enough of the ball. Let's
have a look at some incidents with Curtis Allen. He did get himself
involved there was a solitary run at times. The boy has got pace and
good technique, a ball into the middle was well defended by the
Crusaders. Another occasion he could get down into the same area
and get across him and there is no one there. Would you prefer to see
him through the centre more? They do have a left winger who has not
shown much in those areas. Curtis Allen has had to come and pick the
ball up. The majority of his goals have been in the six yard box. He
is a predator and he times his runs well but he cannot do that if the
ball is not supplied to him. That is what is happening at the moment.
He is going to have to go in there and take the fear or awake from
those players. I think they are playing within themselves. It is
not a true reflection of the team that they are and what they are
capable of. Maybe they can instil a bit more confidence in them and get
at Crusaders. They are not invincible. If you put pressure on
defenders, especially in the Cup final, you have a chance of getting
something. But at the moment it is easy for Crusaders and Coleraine
don't come out and get on Chris Morrow running the show    and stop
him running the show, they could run out with an easy defeat. They
are capable of something, that I have no doubt. Stuart Dallas, have
you been impressed with him, Chris? I think in the period where
Crusaders got on top be started coming to the fore. He had great
pace and had a good part in the goal. He makes the run, be on the
front players. He gets in there and possibly could have nicked it on a
little more. He decides to take it early but unfortunately it slices
off his boot. In the latter half I thought he dictated things a little
more. The key players have responded. What about the penalty
claim? At first we thought it wasn't, but in the slow motion it
look like it might have been. one of those way you have seen them
given, but the ball did plate on to the hand. I don't think the
intention was there to handle the ball, and I don't think the
intention was there at all. It does look worse in slow motion. We have
seen them given against Liverpool, Surrey, for Liverpool, early in the

Cliftonville are beating Carrick You were out of work at the minute
as a football manager. Does the job they tempt you? It doesn't. I am
enjoying a break from the game. I didn't realise the pressure that I
had been carrying around with me over the years until I finished and
I realised there was a lot more to life. I'm not saying fire wouldn't
go back into management again. My hunger is returning but at the
moment I'm happy with how things are. Chris, how would you describe
the situation there at the moment? They need to look to appoint a
manager and I suppose try and steady the ship. It is a club in
disarray, no doubt about it. It probably needs strong leadership.
Who the right person this is not an easy thing. It is not something
that will have a quick appointment. They recognise the season has gone
One old boy from Coleraine is here today, he made his name playing for
The Bannsiders, and it is the new Northern Ireland manager, Michael
O'Neill. He said he would have loved that job, but he is busy at
the moment. It all began view as a 15 year old for you at Coleraine,
but you have to say Crusaders are worth the lead. They have been the
dominant team from about 15 minutes. Chris Morrow and Watson and Stuart
Dallas of Collymore into the game and they are deservedly ahead.   
have come more into the game. Coleraine have a big task in the
second half. From that 15 year old at Coleraine, now the number one
job in the country. The easy question, what does Oran Kearney
need to say to turn it round in the dressing room? It is a bit similar
to last season with Lisburn Distillery. They did not settle
well but came out in the second half and turned it round. I think
Coleraine need to take chances and take the shackles off. They have
nothing to lose, and if they get themselves level it could be their
day, but Crusaders have been dormant and Coleraine will have to
live    lift their levels. We will let you off the book about Northern
Ireland, because the teams are back out. And congratulations on the job.
The bank you very much. Nike Air    thank you very much. Michael
O'Neill with a big job ahead of him. And Oran Kearney as well. I would
like to see Coleraine using a bit more width. Johnny Black has a
great left peg, so let's get him more involved and get some crosses
in the box. Curtis Allen can finish them. The next goal obviously
crucial. As Michael O'Neill said, if Coleraine get a goal, they are
back in, but if Crusaders get it it is moving away from them. That is
the key thing at the beginning of this half. OK, time to rejoin David
Distillery were trailing in came back. When I looked at Coleraine
before today they have played 31 games this season and have lost
just four, so they are not used to losing. They have a lot of
character and consistency in the team. Ferry much so. I think
Stephen's summation was 100 % right. The goal has brought the game to
life and I'm sure Oran Kearney has said, look at the players    crowd

David Rainey. Missing the first opportunity to get in. Chris Morrow
takes the opportunity. Could save! Well anticipated from the keeper,
but the big man was so close. great effort. What was David
Scullion doing losing the board? That man Morrow won it again. Big
Jordan did everything right. You probably hit it too well, if you
can do such a thing. A decent save by Gavin Cullen. A bit of a
Hollywood save, but he got there. One for the cameras, but David

corner. That brings the temporary grandstand behind the goal of full
trot. This is the pressure that Oran Kearney will have demanded.
But you have to make it count and little foot went in there from
Curtis. Definitely a free kick in what you guys in the media call a
forward's tackle. Usually used to excuse the tackle, but I think the
referee was well aware of what he was trying to do. No wonder Stephen
McBride was annoyed. Stephen the commentators cars.. Prior to
that great interplay between the two men. In terms of Stuart Dallas
and Chris Morrow. Not sure if they are heeding the warning that was
given to them, particularly by beat Manchester United 2 One in the
FA Cup as Jennings hammers it wide. I think my producer must be a
Liverpool supporter as he told me to mention it again. He is probably
overjoyed. I'm not. Nice little header from Curtis Allen. He had to
take it quickly. Disappointment for 13 games this season and have won
them all, so Crusaders, beware. There is a durability about this
team. They don't know when they are beaten. That has been instilled
in the first half, and just for a fleeting moment, I thought, was
that a handball? I still cannot work it out. It didn't look like it
years old. Still going. He always had a great pace through his career
exclusively on the wide. He will want more from his side as they had
the flourish in the first five minutes but then Crusaders got hold
of it again. A chance for a break safety, and that should be a
Crusaders throw in. Taking a touch forward. They do, Jackie. You are
so right. The front too isolated.   many gaps and too many options. Too
impression that Coleraine have just not settled and may be the occasion
has got to them. It can so often happen if it has been a long time
since a team has been in a final. This is a relatively young team.
There has been so much hype. We see the size of the crowd that has come
out. Listening to Oran Kearney in the build up, I think the whole
town have taken the occasion but at the moment their players are not
annoyed with themselves because they were desperately want to
impress and do well. There is no lack of effort or commitment.
Things are just not going right for them at the moment. Their last
trophy was nine years ago. That is a great challenge. There is the
experience of Paul Leeman. It is not clear yet. It should be now.
Who can they bring on to change things? Johnny Watt, if he came on,
would be making his 150 of appearances. Ciaran Clarke could
get you a goal. But they have got to do something. David Scullion.
But lets not write them off, David. They have been too consistent this
season. They have been, so do not write them off it. That is a good
saving tackle from Paul Leeman. While they are not playing at to
park, they are only one goal behind. As we said earlier, a goal can
change everything. Crusaders have lost just 10 of 34 games, so that

accomplished footballer. I think this might be a free kick. No, he

with good reason. They are no slouches. Coleraine are 4th in the
league table and Crusaders are sick.    6th. That is better from a
Coleraine. Ryan McIlmoyle. That is the Vaseline on his head. Down the
line. The ball is for Aidan Watson and he gets it forward, but towards
the Jordan Owens. Not a bad touch from the big striker. Encouraging
signs there. A good passage of play from the Coleraine. It needed a
good tackle from Gareth McKeown. If they can just build on that. They
need to probe. The standard a style of Gareth McKeown, he takes the
throw. David Ogilby won it. trophy on its way back there? It
looks that way at the moment but there is still a long way to go. We
have got half an hour left. There will be extra time and penalties if
good run this season. They are doing very well. They have done
phenomenally well. They play some couple of times this season. Very
much so. They have played very well against us. There is going to be a
change for Coleraine. We will tell you about that in a moment. David
Rainey. Charged down. I think Ruairi Harkin is getting ready to
come on. Well charged down by just about ready. I think this
might be the chance to bring him on. Ruairi Harkin, 22 years of age. He
only joined a couple of weeks ago on an 18 month deal from Derry City.
Ryan McIlmoyle goes off. I saw him play last week. They could be a
change of formation. He has gone into the centre of midfield. He
obviously wants them to play in a three. That is a good ball. It was
from a David McMaster to find it David Rainey. Stuart Gallas was
unlucky. I think they decided they were not getting down past the full
backs so they decided to change formation as quickly as we can.
think it is a three. Gareth McKeown, at a pace. He does not even get the
throw in, though, for his efforts. The long ball from the back and
Shane Jennings gives chase. Ironic as it sounds, this formation might
give them a more attacking options, but they will take it in turns to
stop the full back. It is a disciplined way of playing. You
might just find that Gareth McKeown and Stephen McBride get more joy
than David Scullion, Curtis Allen and Shane Jennings. A good point,
David. Stuart Gallas. The free kick has been given to Coleraine. I
think Stuart Gallas was hampering Howard Beverland. Stephen Baxter
looks on bewildered. Why was that? It is taken quickly. Here we go.
Paul Leeman have not do much wrong but they have not been ended too
much pressure.    under too much pressure. I really feel Shane
Jennings is not being given the support he needs. Colin Coates and
Paul Leeman have been on top. They have not been penetrated at any
to you. Oran Kearney is desperate for his team to do well and he is
just trying to urge them on. The hardest thing for a manager, when
the players cross that white line, you have got to trust them
implicitly because it is all over to them. David Rainey judged that
well but so did the goalkeeper. Well done, Gavin Cullen, he did
Morrow. 26 years of age and his 55th goal of for the club. His 6th
in their League Cup campaign. They are happy, although they don't show
it in that particular shot. Good control by Stephen Lowry. He did
well. Here is Chris Morrow, who has pulled a lot of strings in midfield.
Jordan Owens did not get any space. Good defending by Howard Beverland
and David Ogilby. Stephen McBride gives it away. Howard Beverland
gets it away despite the attentions of a Coleraine player. Crusaders
throw in. The difficulty now for Coleraine, they have made a
tactical change, sometimes Shane Jennings is dropping into the hole.
Subsequently, the players are now makes a run ahead of him. He shows

forward. Shane Jennings on the run. Curtis Allen on the run. Shane
Jennings goes for gold. He almost succeeded. David Scullion chips to
the back post. It is wide of the Mark from Shane Jennings. He shows
his disappointment. So does his manager. But that was better from
the Bannsiders. Great strength from Shane Jennings. He does ever so
well because of that ball was opportunities like that because
Cathair Friel pressed for the first five a six minutes.    Coleraine
pressed for the first final six minutes. That could be a big
turning point in this final. Let's not underestimate the save of Sean

industrious and very successful to date. Jordan Owens! He should have
done better. There is no doubt about it. The big man will be
annoyed with himself. That was a great chance for him. He just did
not get over it. We have had a chance at the other end. This is
certainly one for Crusaders. That could be a turning point as well.

He is asking a bit of Shane Jennings. The goalkeeper did well,

little bit at the end. No, you have got to give credit where it is due.
Please stop. You have got to give credit. I am not going to comment

belly will be going mad because he will be asking, where it is   
where is it going to come from? You are just desperate for something to
Black special? Here is a good view of it. It is a long way out. It is
not a bad effort at all and I think the goalkeeper was struggling. So
close, that young man. A spectacular goal earlier in the
season and almost another one. Did it take a touch on the way through?
It may have done. Just swerving away. An audacious attempt. With
the distance and the angle, it is only someone of Johnny Black's
ability who would take that on. You want someone to run him on the ball.
Even if it gets a flick or drainage, it could end up in the back of the
net.    A flick or a nudge. It is a good skill. To keep the modern
football down and not plays it over are still working harder. A lot of
people would suggest that because of the make up of the modern day
football, it is easier to make it dip and bend, but I would not
necessarily agree with that. It is a great skill to strike a good ball
together. Can they pull this out of macro.    Gareth Tommons. That
passage of pressure is over for the moment. A little skirmish in the
corner there but Watson did ever so well. There is the Crusaders border.
They will be pleased with the Scullion goes off it. 19th birthday
for Ciaran Clarke. Maybe the script Morrow. The flag is up, it will not
count. I think the man with the flag got it right. It was close. He
thought he had number two. So did he. He finished it, but it has been
wiped out. David? Again, Chris Morrow making the run. There is no
doubt about it. A great piece of officialdom. But those are the
decisions that need to be made. The linesman was up with play and I
think he called it correctly. you will be on first name terms
with his linesman, who ICU berating week after week.    Oh you seem to
be berating week after week. 11 minutes left. Crusaders still lead
by one goal in this Irn Bru League Cup final. Shane Jennings slipped.
No way there for Curtis Allen. David, just to remind you, you have
got to pick the man of the match. I have a feeling through one or two
of the contenders might be, but I will keep my council. Colin Coates
has been impressive, Stuart Gallas has been impressive and Chris
Morrow has a very much made the Howard Beverland has done very well
breached once. It may be a very vital goal. It may well win this
cup final. We shall see. That was close. That must have hit the post.
I thought the goalkeeper had to save it. Here it is again. Yes, it
did hit the post. The throw caused the confusion. He stuck a day for
it. I think the 'keeper may have got there had he needed to. To be
fair, he did have it covered. was unlucky. David McMaster goes
off it. Declan Caddell comes on. has played over 100 games for
Crusaders. A couple of goals this season for Declan Caddell.

superb goal. Things were not looking good for you against

much. He is getting away with it. The foot was high. And later. The
referee has a nice word with the 22 year old. He is a 19, in fact,
Caddell's touch was poor. But Coleraine have given it away again.
That is infuriating for the manager and the supporters. Coleraine can
play some great stuff. I think that might be the bitter pill, if they
do play    used for this final, that they have not played or done
themselves justice. A big occasion, praise of Coleraine, and this
performance today is not typical. It is not about attitude, it is not
a bad effort, it is not about commitment. On the day, passes are
their of the Ballymena Showgrounds. All credit to Ballymena. They were
very pleased that a Cup Final was coming here but it really is a
marvellous complex. All credit to the local council. A free kick for
Coleraine. Are we going to have drama as we approach the closing
think he realises Johnny Black might be hitting this. There he is.
It is not really the side for a for the goalkeeper in the end.
There is his disappointment. I hope you can't lip read. Exasperation
for Johnny Black. Chris Morrow. He has worked tirelessly. Stephen
McBride with the header. It did not will be telling his troops to throw
caution to the wind. He might get beaten by two or three. Forward by
Ruairi Harkin. Colin Coates won it. He has been a colossus at the back.
Chris Morrow. That was nearly a mistake by Gavin Cullen. That was
the right idea by Jordan Owens. He just didn't hit it long enough and
himself out of nothing. Just by pure hard work and Endeavour. A
   McBride. So, Stephen Baxter, seven years in the job next
February. He has won two senior trophies, the Cup and Shield, and
it looks like he is about to add to that. He has been in six finals and
won two, lost four, so he knows Coates wins it in the air, and how
Coleraine, but sadly they have not displayed all the quality and
talent that has been in the side this season. That will be the big
minute of this Cup final. So, David, who is the Irn Bru League Cup man 
of the match? There have been some very impressive performances. The
central defensive partnership at Coleraine, they have done very well.
Aidan Watson, Stuart Dallas have done fantastically well. Colin
Coates and Paul Leeman have been strong. But my man of the match,
without a shadow of the doubt, is Chris Morrow. Not just about the
goal, but how he has broken up the play from Coleraine. Every time he
makes himself available for his team mates he is looking for the
run, so Chris Morrow is my man of the match. Not too many will argue
with that choice. A super game for the midfielder. Here is McBride.
2 0? He is not. All credit to the Coleraine defenders. Did not give
past and a great career, and he is still going. Well done David,
Rainey.    well done David Rainey. The deserves that standing ovation
from the Crusaders performance. What effort, commitment and quality
today. Well done, David. The great example to young players. Such a
Irish League who get hungrier because they know it is countdown
time in terms of their career. It really is an inspiring attitude
Howard Beverland who almost sold them a free one in injury time. Who
is going to tell Colin Coates he is not the man of the match? I will
leave that to you. Have you seen time and keep the ball up to this
faces at the end, we will be sure of that, unless, unless they
produce some drama right at the ball in the corner, as far away
the big crowd up from Coleraine is drift out. The it means so much,
David, but to country clubs like Coleraine, Portadown, it means so
much to get two or Cup final and win it, but today it looks as
though there will be disappointment. and you see the numbers are now
have come out today, and they will be this leap    bitterly
disappointed. Particularly Oran Kearney. While they have given
everything in terms of effort and commitment, they know they have not
played near their potential. It has been, by their standards, a very
flat performance today. And that will be the thing to stick in their
lose to a better team, you can hold your hands up, but not like that
today. Curtis Allen just did not get to pull the trigger or we would
have had drama. Be would have had extra time.    we would have had
of the dice. We have played the 94 minutes. A lot of the Coleraine
fans below the commentary box are making their way out. There is the
difference, a very glum looking Coleraine, and very very happy
Crusaders men. Wait for the whistle. wild. Stephen Baxter has claimed
his third trophy. Happiness on the bench for the Crusaders, and it
goes without saying, they have deserved it. No doubt about that,
Jackie. They have given their all, but on the date I think Crusaders
deserved the victory. Stephen In Sean O'Neill they had a sure
custodian. The two full backs have been very solid. Paul Leeman, Colin
Coates, they were dominant. Chris Morrow the outstanding player on
the day. Dallas and master, they posed all sorts of problems.   
McMaster. And nice touch there. is the most awful feeling. You feel
so much for Johnny black, yet Stephen Baxter most dignified. That
is brilliant. It says so much about our local game. There is humility,
modesty and outstanding example. Not celebrating, but commiserating
with the opposition. He knows when to commiserate and then celebrate.
It speaks volumes for Stephen Baxter. He will be delighted.
Crusaders will enjoy this day. They Morrow. All the way across. Colin
You are live with us, with the man  of the match, Chris Morrow. You
probably could have had four, the first to this man, Chris, one goal
difference, and what a difference. That is what it was going to take
today. A hard fought game and one goal was going to be the winner.
Thankfully has turned out to be mine. For you, this must be extra
special. Crusaders through and through. You are now in your 10th
year and you will see out another two. Describe what it means. It is
unbelievable. It is my first senior medal as a playing member. I was
involved in the 2009 Irish Cup game, but I never got to play in the
final. It means everything. To score the winner, that makes it
better. The Northern Ireland manager will present this tea when
a second, but you had to be in the running. He has been a stalwart,
never faltered, so the great man. Given that it is 10 years and
counting, you're not begrudge him man of the match. No, he is my old
mate, we came to the club on the same night and he has all the
ability in the world. When he applies himself the way he did
today, no one better in the league. The truth is you probably should
have won more convincingly, but one was enough. It made for a nervous
time. You are always nervous when you are just one goal up, but we
were solid. I don't think Coleraine had many shots. A few scrambles in
the box, but I thought we were solid and never looked like
conceding. Let me bring in the man who made him nervous. Jordan, you
could have had a second half hat  trick. 1 0 well done us, but I'm
sure the boss will be happy. But I could have had a couple myself. At
the end of the day, we won the game and Chris got it, a great player.
Comfortable winners on the day. I will sleep well tonight. Oh no
you're not thank me, one header over the bar, then one they hit the
post, and then you saw the keeper off his line on the 88th minute and
you knew what she wanted to do, and you tried to chip him. Were you out
of steam? The boss were shouting me to take it into the corner, but any
player wants to score in a cup final. I was nervous in case we had
conceded with the chances I had, but worthy winners. This one was
for the entire show Road. This was for the fans. We started a bit
sluggish in the league and Denny Cup you bring back is a big honour
for the club.    any Cup. There is barely a hair's breadth between you
and Coleraine this season. The league table reflects it. You will
feel for them as you celebrate a victory. They have been Super this
year. Oran Kearney has been great when he came in. Coleraine could
maybe do it this year, but we will push on to see where we can go. We
have a cup in our hands now and we will take it from there. I off you
go and celebrate. Thank you very Marty Quinn and Chris Morgan are
still here in the studio. Crusaders deservedly is this afternoon.
think so. Coleraine never really got a hold on the game and if
anyone was going to increase the advantage it was Crusaders and it
was fairly comfortable in the end. The experience seemed to be the
difference. They just had a bit more grittiness. It kept them in
good stead through the game. The defenders really supported the
goalkeeper. I think he only had one save to make over 90 minutes, and a
very good side. He got a good firm hand on it. But other run that I
cannot remember great chances for chilly    Colin Staff. Back to
These are gold medals for the winners, silver for the runners up,
like the Olympics. There is a Nobel winner's medal, a 5th winners'
medal for Paul Leeman. Michael Halliday, he didn't get to play,
but he has a winner's medal. There is the man of the match. David
Rainey, the grand old man. McMaster or, and big Jordan, who could have
I think Colin Coates is on his way up, the man who has been with the
club since he was a boy. He is now 26. His 299 is appearance by making
today, for Colin Coates, and it is a Cup final winner. Handed over by
the sponsors. Delight for Crusaders. Colin Coates, the players, they
dominated and they deserve it. Without question. Those fans are
ready to celebrate, as are the players. It is a great moment for
Stephen Baxter as well. Very much so. There is nothing like winning a
cup final. As we said, Stephen has been at the club for seven years
and done a fantastic job and has been making a real mark on the team.
They were excellent throughout. the other side, there is the
disappointment. As a player, that is the most awful, awful feeling,
and as a manager as well. You have to stand there and take it and show
respect. My goodness gracious Me, does it hurt. When you see the
celebration of the other team and There we are. All ages. That man
has seen some league titles. So there we are. Let's hand over to
Mark Sidebottom. We are running out of time, Stephen Baxter, but what
does it mean for you in 20 seconds? The boys have worked incredibly
hard. They took the game to them all afternoon and we probably
should have scored more. We were worthy winners today, magnificent.
Another trophy for you, three in seven years. You're doing all right.
You have to keep working hard in football. You never know when it
will turn for you. We are having a good run, the people here are
enjoying it. Give them away. Back to the studio. Yes, credit to
Stephen Baxter. He outfoxed his younger number. He did, but Oran
Kearney will learn from this. Crusaders have been here and done
it before and that experience to them in good stead. They did show
that they had learnt from previous games at a high level. A young team,
their first final in a long while and for many their first final.
They will improve and learn from it. Credit to Crusaders, but Coleraine
who have been on a great run, they will be back began stronger.
think so. You can sometimes learn more from defeat in the situation.
These young players, how they improve and learnt from this will
be the testimony to today's performance. I think we will see
