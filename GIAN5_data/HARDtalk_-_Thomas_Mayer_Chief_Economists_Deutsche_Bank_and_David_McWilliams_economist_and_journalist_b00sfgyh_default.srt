meeting and have their negotiators have spent six hours in their
discussions which were held in London.

Chelsea are this season's Premier League champions. They needed to

That's all from me. As commentators and historians
start writing their accounts of the 2010 election, we ask how big an
issue class was to voters. A fashion shift in the Middle East.
We discover how a traditional dress is making a comeback in Egypt.
The tour's one of the hardest fought election campaigns in many
years. Gordon Brown was the underdog, given no chance by every
British newspaper bar one. He cut a figure like King Lear. David
Cameron and Nick Clegg. A Labour candidate described his Prime
Minister as the worst in history. We headed north to Yorkshire to
find out how much it's still mattered.
For I am on a journey in search of an issue that has plagued Britain
and the rest of the world for history but still exercises   
politicians are talking about class. If Gordon Brown want to fight a
class war, fine. It doesn't work.
Class has been raised because David Cameron is the poshest man to run
for Prime Minister in decades. Where better to revisit its impact
then at the very top? There is someone here I would really like
you to meet. A I have been brought up here so I
am used to having people around all the time.
The Honourable Simon Howard was born into fabulous wealth, with
traditions and outfits to match. His home is a national treasure and
he, like David Cameron, went to Eton. It moulds you for life, for
better or for worse. We knew open your mouth, one
clearly knows we were coming from. A true.
It is the way one was brought up. The even here, things have changed.
It has become a business.    when you open your mouth.
Do it is not really about class, it is about money. People really look
at that now and think, it is the wealth people create and the power
they have. Classy a to Britain is what race is
in America.    class is it to Britain. Class has changed over the
years. At Oxford, David Cameron was a member of an elite club, one of
the symbols of an upper class upbringing.
I headed to another part of Yorkshire, to where someone
believes his    some would have you believe is the sight of the
enduring class war. The only thing that is left of coal mining here is
the colliery brass band and an awful lot of memories. Especially
in the park that once used to be the mind. Does it make you sad to
look at this place? Everybody worked here.
These men discussed the Conservative Party like many people
here. The miners' strike when Prime Minister Thatcher did poorly and
the daughter of a grocery    grocer close down the colliery. Miners
waged battle with police. One stars class mean? I don't know.
   what does class mean? They're happy where they are, we are happy
where we are. The does it mean something today
than it used to? Do be just still there, without a
doubt. This country has the biggest divide than anywhere else in the
world. I really think that. The if I can't see how it will make
any difference. Racing is the sport of kings so's
surely they would have strong views about class here.    socially.
Thanks to a combination of the recession and the expenses scandal
in Parliament... Of they are all posher than me.
Upper class, middle class, whatever class you want, it will not help
the working man. They all want to line their own pockets.
The bigger challenge for politicians of any class is to
reach kindle faith in the political process. At a time when the gulf
between society's winners and losers has become a chasm.
For a naturalised American born in Pakistan has been charged with
trying to explode a weapon of mass destruction in New York's Times
Square. Faisal Shahzad admitted trading in Pakistan's    training
in Pakistan and trying to detonate a car bomb in the crowded area.
Educated, affable, professional, a son of privilege in Pakistan who
built a life in the USA. A great deal was hidden behind the public
face of Faisal Shahzad, according to investigators. His father rose
from these dusty streets in the village to the top ranks of the
Pakistani air force. The ancestral home was quiet today. We found no
sign of life. Close relatives are believed to be in protective
custody. Members of the family say they are in shock. One told us,
when he heard what happened in New York, his hair stood on end. He
said the family are quite respectable people with no history
of involvement in militancy. What has happened, he said, is a tragedy.
Faisal Shahzad's cousin said he was not an extremist. He wasn't
religious, he told me. He didn't even prayed much. Ask around here
and there are hints of other things. His friend from childhood last saw
the Times Square suspect 18 months ago.
We didn't talk about the Taliban but he talked about American poll
done up    American policies towards Muslims, especially in Iraq
and Afghanistan. If did that anger at drive him into
the arms of Pakistani militants? Perhaps, but so far, US officials
cannot confirm he has links to the Pakistani Taliban or anyone else.
This family friend saw signs of change three years ago when Faisal
Shahzad grey beard and showed signs of change.
A way he got married and went to stay in Karachi, some inner changes
took place.    when he got married. He became silent and that was a
symptom of these changes. Faisal Shahzad passed unnoticed
from the shadows of Karachi to the heart of Times Square. The question
for investigators here and in the US is, how many others could do the
same? It was 20 years ago this month that
Ryan White, a young American, died of Aids. Raising awareness of this
deadly disease for many who were previously unaware. For many, the
air    epidemic was already taking ATOL in New York City. Many of them
were cared for in some Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village. The
hospital has now gone bankrupt and is forced to close.
The after 160 years in Greenwich Village, St Vincent's Hospital is
no more. The sirens of the ambulances have been silenced by
bankruptcy. Founded by the Catholic Sisters of Charity, this hospital
has treated survivors from the Titanic and the 9/11 attacks. It
played a crucial role in treating thousands upon thousands of Aids
patients. From his balcony in Chelsea, these men can see St
Vincent. Two of his lovers died there including the man who was
prominent in the struggle for gay rights early in the city.
There are very few of us left. vast majority died of Aids. I was
with him and a close friend and we were holding him when he took his
last breath.   the closure of St Vincent's marks
the end of an era. This hospital was at the epicentre of an Aids
crisis in the 1990s. Because of its location in the Greenwich Village,
then the heart of the gay community. Treating mainly gay patience wasn't
without its tensions. These sisters are saying goodbye to the
hospital's chapel. They say their mission to serve the needy was
always at the forefront when it came to treating Aids patients.
Her part of the issue with the gay community, they were not sure they
trusted the hospital because we were under the Catholic auspices.
They came because they were so sick. They found that there was no
distinction and no question. We were out fair to treat them. We
cared about them. We were not here to judge them and I think, in a
very special way, we, the Sisters of Charity, would face of the
Church to them. The Aids Outpatient Clinic remains
open and the search is on for someone who will provide the
funding. Compared to the early days of the Aids crisis, doctors like
Barbara Johnson are able to do so much more for their patients.
We were be by their bedsides, literally holding their hands with
nothing to do. Today, we manage the illness. People are still afraid.
They still have images of what aides can do. We say, look, we have
got something for you. The new drugs came to a later for those New
Yorkers who died of Aids when nothing seemed to work.
The support group, Friends Indeed, founded to help Aids patients, the
role of St Vincent will not be forgotten.
The Aids epidemic was such an important event. They should be
reverence for it, because that is when all those hundreds of hundreds
of people died. Her the hospital may be sold to
real estate developers    developers. This will always be the
place where the scale of New York's Education, education, education, a
mantra for politicians. A key for being competitive in the global
economy. In a recent poll of parents in the US, 60% of those who
replied believed the US was worse than other countries when it came
to teaching maths and science. Many see a strict education system in
South Korea as the way forward. President Obama praised it but it
is not without its fullback.    its flaws.
Of course, no news report about South Korean education would be
complete these days without an average South Korean school boy or
girl to help us illustrate the issues. This is a 10 year old boy
in another tough day at school. Schoolchildren get on average one
of our sleep less every night and their American counterparts. Here
is another statistic to chew on. Every day, South Korean children
study for almost three hours more than those in the US. Breakfast is
food for thought. The harder you work and the early you begin, he
tells me, the better university you get into and the better university
means a better job. South Korea is a country obsessed with education,
a place where families jostle and compete for every opportunity for
their children. Perhaps it is because of the confusion I deal
under which it knowledge is a passport to the status and wealth,
by whatever the reason, this country's lust for learning has
caught the eye of one rather influential individual. During his
visit to Seoul last November, President Obama has said he asked
his South Korean counterpart to name in this country's biggest
educational challenge. Not fumbling schools or meagre budgets, came the
reply, but parents who are too demanding. The first lesson is
geometry. In measurements of school level mathematics ability, South
Korea sits near the top of the table. That has impressed President
Obama who has been publicly praising the extended school
timetable and to the results it produces. But his South Korea in
such    such a good role model? This boy has a few private lessons
a week but many face and after school routine their tracks on four
cross after class. Sometimes until midnight. Even the South Korean
government which welcomes President Obama's warm words is a little
taken aback. I was surprised because we always thought we had
some problems in our education system. We have to take care of a
problem before it becomes a big trouble. In fact, the government
now appears to believe that South Korea's problem is too much
education. This country's late  night private schools are robbing
children of their childhood, the theory goes, and with an over 
reliance on learning, pupils are being turned into little more than
a exam pass in machines. This competition requires a lot of
memory, a lot of work. Not imagination but memory. You have to
memorise thousands of things. We like to change their kind of
education system. Meanwhile, South Korean families are voting with
their feet. Every year, 1,000 send their children overseas in search
of a better education.    thousands cent. At this fair, I met a family
thinking about leaving Korea for the sake of their children. Crehan
education is one dimensional, Mr Kim tells me, foreign schools are
more creative and open minded. Back to an average boy. His family
cannot afford to escape or pay for the best private tuition to compete
at    private tuition. To compete, he has a fight ahead of him. Some
would say that South Korea also offers a warning that you can have
too much of a good thing. For the past 30 years, Egypt has
witnessed the decline of the gallop there. Peasants still well    wear
them but businessman put first suits. Egyptians are banned from
wearing it in some private clubs and hotels. If one independent
politician has its way, it will be restored to its former glory.
In a dusty, dimly lit tailor's shop in Old Cairo, this man has come for
a fitting. The old man who scurries around him is of the designer. Not
of Western style suits but the traditional cotton robe that. He is
an independent MP and a man of elegance. But he champions the
causes of the poor and the clothes they wear. He has put forward a
Bill that would install the rope as Egypt's national dress. When I'd
went on TV in a national programme, my daughters were crying when I was
leaving the house in the road, because they like a father who is
dressed in designer labels. The roads are not us. They symbolise
Egyptian national dress beyond the turn of the last century. Had
generations of his family have been proud to wear it. There have been
plenty of other traditions that have died. Not many Egyptians can
still iron with their feet. There is one other familiar garment that
has succumbed to changing tastes. This was once an essential part of
the Egyptian dress. In the 1920s, every government official would
wear one, that is until the 1950s when the revolution came about and
this was exile, along with the monarchy. This is the oldest
manufacturing in Cairo, one of only a handful. Very few people would
wear one. There are fears that one day it will go the same way. Modern
designers like this woman who makes clothes for a younger generation of
Egyptians think that the days of the rope are numbered. For her, it
is the dress of the poorer classes. For an aspiring designer, it is not
a garment on which to build profit or a sense of national pride and
unity. When I come to a meeting and find a man wearing it, I feel
reserved in the way I talk to him. He is very old fashioned and might
think of me as too liberal. We don't want that. If his critics say
there are more important issues to discuss. But while his fellow MPs
are unlikely to vote in favour of his bill, they are also unlikely to
come out against him. It is still the preferred dress in the
countryside and it never pays to insult the close of the people who
Hello. We are in for a pretty chilly week ahead and we are
expecting some of overnight frost. A chilly start to the morning and
we will see some spells of sunshine developing. One or two showers
around. With the cool air from the north, some will be a bit wintry in
nature. Some sleet and snow for the hills. For northern England, the
chance of some rain. Elsewhere, it is looking fairly dry with some
cloud around. Best of any brightness in the southern counties
of England. Some sunny spells, lifting temperatures to 14 degrees.
Further north, some places will struggle to get temperatures into
double figures. Temperatures below what we would expect for this time
