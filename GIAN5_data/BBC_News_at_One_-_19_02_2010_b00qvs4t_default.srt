that you on board. Catch you later, Who's best to get Britain back into
to the black? 60 leading economists support Labour, saying it's right
to delay spending cuts. The Conservatives say that would
undermine the recovery. Gordon Brown accuses them of scare tactics.
I say to the British people this is not the time to put the recovery at
risk. This is the time to make sure that growth and jobs are secure.

Good afternoon. What's the best way to get the UK's public finances
from the red back into the black? Everyone agrees cuts will have to
be made in public spending, but how deep should they be and when should
they start? Well, today 60 leading economists have come out in support
of Labour's plan to delay cuts until 2011. Last weekend 20 others
backed the Conservatives' call for cuts to come a lot sooner, they
want them imposed this year. Here is our chief economics
correspondent Hugh Pym. After years of spending and
borrowing increases, whoever's running the Government after the
election will have to make a big decision, how quickly to stop the
radical cuts must wait until an economic recovery has taken hold.
He warmed to his theme this morning. This is not the time to put the
recovery at risk. This is the time to make sure that growth and jobs
are secured. 2010 must be the year of growth, it must not be the year
when the economy dips back into recession. The Prime Minister was
boosted by letters to the Financial Times backed by more than 60
leading economists, they say the Treasury plans for the next 12
months with no big squeeze are sensible. Unemployment is high
because people are not spending enough money to provide full
employment. In that situation the Government has to keep spending in
order to stop unemployment from rising. We shouldn't see Government
cuts until we have seen the recovery well under way and
unemployment on its way down. came as a repost to a letter in the
Sunday Times signed by 20 economists arguing for radical
action to bring down the deficit. think that the the economist who is
have attacked it have done so on the basis they don't think there's
real scope for the private sector to recover. I think that's wrong. I
think low interest rates and easier credit will help the private sector
to recover, whereas if the Government is borrowing all the
money that is available, then that actually will get in the way of a
real and sustained recovery. Sunday Times letter was seen as
supportive of Shadow Chancellor George Osbourne's call for a more
ambitious deficit reduction plan. Today the Conservatives argued that
business leaders, as well as the 20 economists, also backed their
position. Whoever walks through the door of number 11 Downing Street
after the election has critical decisions to make and in doing so
will draw support from some economists, those decisions on how
quickly to bring down borrowing will affect the livelihoods of
millions of people across the economy.
Hugh joins us now. What's your continuing assessment of this, how
significant is this? Well, it's a very significant debate in the run 
up to the election and beyond. These two issues, how do you
sustain the economy and help it come through a recovery, and how do
you deal with this Government deficit, one of the biggest of any
industrialised nation. The parties can fight to a standstill before
polling, but after whoever wins has to make decisions which could go
right and help or could get in the way and make things worse. It shows
how difficult it's going to be for them that the economics provision
is divided how best to deal with the situation. It's worth
remembering though that however many economists you have on your
side doesn't mean you are necessarily right. In 1981 Jeffrey
Howe, the then Chancellor, wanted to go ahead with a tax raising
budget just as the economy was coming out of recession and 364
economists wrote saying what a bad idea it was. 364 against the
Chancellor, history shows that he was more right than wrong and they,
if you like, hadn't quite got it right at the time.
A nine year old boy has been stabbed to death following an
attack at his home in Bradford. His 18 year old sister, who was also
stabbed is recovering in hospital, a 20 year old man has been arrested
on suspicion of murder. Chris Buckler reports.
In the streets where the nine year  old boy lived detectives are
investigating his death. He was stabbed several times here just
before 8.00 last night, his 18  year old sister was also injured in
the attack. It's the age of the boy who has died that's left this
community so stunned. Feels like you are not safe any more, not even
kids any more. Not even in their own house or in the gardens or
anything. It's shocking really. Stuff like that shouldn't happen.
Everyone's shocked, it's horrible. Loads of little kids play on this
street and you don't expect it to happen, you read about it, you
don't expect it to happen on your street. It's horrible. Forensic
officers arrived here this morning to try to establish exactly what
happened at the house last night. A police cordon has been put in place
but detectives have arrested a 20  year old man. It's understood that
he suffers from mental health problems. The nine year old went to
school with many other children who live in the area, and the family
are well known to neighbours. nice kid, never bothered nobody.
The nine year old boy lived metres from his sister, police officers
are at both homes today. A forensic tent in the backyard of one of them,
a sign of the investigation into a young child's murder. However, with
one man in custody, detectives have made clear that they currently have
no other suspects. Thousands Thousand what's the best
way to provide care for the elderly, it's likely to and key question in
the forthcoming general election, it's also being discussed today at
a conference in London attended by the Government, the Lib Dems and a
number of charities. However, the Conservatives have refused to take
part as they say it's a political ploy, they oppose the so called
death tax, one of the proposals under discussion. Ross Hawkins
reports. MPs have long agreed the way we
care for the elderly in England has to change, but they can't agree
what that change should be. Today, Labour and Liberal Democrats
politicians met with charities to talk again about the problem. The
Conservatives didn't join that discussion, because they said this
gathering was about politics, not about finding solutions. This
conference is just a Labour Party political ploy, frankly. A week ago
the Labour Government weren't interested in hearing from care
charities and councils about what their ideas were, they were
pursuing a compulsory death tax option. I don't accept that. Today
is a serious ateuplt    attempt to take the party politics out of this
issue, it is one of the biggest issues the country faces, the
public need a calm and measured debate, from listening to all the
care organisations and charities and councils who are key voices in
this debate. Until recently those politicians were trying to reach a
consensus in private talks but they failed and this has become a
general election issue. After the events of the last week we have to
demonstrate, first of all that we are prepared to work together, but
also we should use this opportunity when there's heightened interest in
the issue, to engage the public, to initiate a debate about what the
fairest system would be. What system do the parties think is most
fair? The Government has set out three options. A partnership where
it pays some of the cost of care, a voluntary insurance scheme or an
insurance system with guaranteed free care but a compulsory payment
of as much as £20,000. The Conservatives have dubbed that a
death tax and suggested instead a voluntary one off payment of £8,000
to guarantee free paerplt residential care. The Liberal
Democrats want what they call a partnership model with individuals
and Government sharing the bill. Over ten years ago the Government
set up a Royal commission to look into these problems, it's completed
a consultation and today holds another meeting here, for some of
those who already pay for the care they receive will these discussions
aren't proving reassuring. You have to be allowed to have a little bit
of savings left. You must cover your funeral., for one thing. At

Thousands of steel workers are to be balloted over strike action in
protest at the mothballing of part of the Corus plant in Redcar. At
its peak more than 100 blast tpurpbaces lined the banks of the
River Tees. Now the last one is being shut down because a buyer
can't be found. 1600 jobs are likely to be lost. Fiona Trott is
in Redcar. We asked those workers if they
would strike today, rumours of a ballot, they said they would, they
can't kpre comprehend why it is being mothballed, why hasn't
anybody stepped in to buy it? Corus will tell you it's been losing
money, it started with the global recession and that consortium of
companies which promised to buy 80% of its steel pulled out. For
generations of people have worked here, and some of their relatives
came here to protest today. Passionate doesn't even describe it.
That's why so many are at the gates, they're comparing it to the strikes
of the 1980s. And, like then, they're blaming the
Government today. And also Tata, Corus' owner. There's nothing else
in the area. You can't throw away 150 years of, you know, six
generations of people who have worked here from man to boy and
retired and lived and died and the whole thing, you can't throw that
away without feeling a bit of sadness and remorse and frustration
really. And when you mothball part of the steel industry in Redcar,
you mothball the town. It's already suffering from past job losses here,
people now think it will get worse. It's the only place where the pound
shop goes out of business, the shops have shut down. I was made
redundant about six months ago and found it hard to get a job, there's
nothing out there for my skills. For people with these skills it's
going to be even tougher. But the company says it's not over yet.
think there is a prospect somebody could make a cred    credible bid.
The market is improving. There is that prospect. That's one of the
main reasons why we are mothballing the plant and not closing it.
the workers feel it is the end. That's because this isn't just
their bread and butter, it's their heritage too. The day that steel 
making stopped here is going down in history.
There is talk today of three potential bidders, but they'll be
taking on a huge risk and would have to invest millions of pounds.
The company says there just aren't any customers and more importantly,
to get that blast furnace running again once it's been mothballed
will cost tens of millions of pounds.
The High Court has ruled that British Airways can go ahead with
its plans to cut the number of cabin crew staffing some of its
flights. The court refused to grant an injunction to the union Unite.
The company says it has to cut its costs to stay competitive.
Tiger Woods is to make his first public appearance since his fall
from grace three months ago following revelations that he
cheated on his wife. He will speak later today to a limited group of
journalists, although he won't take questions as he tries to rebuild
his public image and relaunch his career. In a moment we will go live
to Florida but first this report from Kevin Gearey.
It started mysteriously with a car accident outside his house, yet
quickly led to the most spectacular unravelling of a sporting icon's
image. It emerged that Tiger Woods wife might not have been equipped
with a golf club at the smash merely to free him from the
wreckage. The bigger car crash was in his private life. In the days
that followed news of his various infidelities filled the news,
almost too numerous to make a proper count. After expressing his
regrets on his websites he withdrew to a clinic specialising in the
treatment of sexual problems and hasn't been seen publicly since.
Inevitably for a personality seen as wholesome and clean and to
become the first billion dollar sportsman some advertisers and
endorsers scrambled to distance themselves. His face disappeared
from many, if not all commercials, with a kopbs stapbt financial
impact. What remains untarnished is his reputation as one of the finest
golfers. The winner of 14 major championships, including four
Masters and three Open championships, he is second only in
the all time list to Jack Nicklaus. Almost certainly he plans to play
in this year's Masters and to prepare for a difficult return will
probably step back on to a golf course soon. How he handles the
predictable teasing and times cutting catcalls will be the
biggest test and will tell us much Matthew Price is at the USPGA tour
headquarters in Florida. The news conference is scheduled to go ahead
in a few hours, but it will be very tightly controlled. Incredibly.
This is all about Tiger Woods and his management team finally taking
control of a story that's been out of their control for three months.
Tiger Woods's agent has said he will be making a prepared statement
prove friends and associates, and a very small number of hand picked
journalists. It is going to happen half a mile from where I'm talking
to you at the moment. The majority of journalists will be watching it
on a live TV feed. Very tightly controlled indeed. I think the
point is that this is the first stage of Tiger Woods trying to make
a PR relations comeback, if you like, ahead of that sports come
back that Kevin Gearey was talking about. There's been criticism about
the timing of the conference from his fellow glofulers. Yes, there is
   golfers. Yes, there's a match play tournament in Arizona. Some
there have expressed their frustration, if not anger, that
Tiger Woods is diverting the attention from them. They say
perhaps he could have chosen a better time to do this. The
Commissioner of the USPGA tour says that it had to take place today
because Tiger Woods is on a break from his therapy. We don't know the
truth of that, but that may explain why it is happening now. Simply put,
Tiger Woods is trying to make a bit of a comeback. He is a divisive
figure now. There are many golfers and indeed fans who are
disappointed with the stories that have come out about him. But at the
same time the USPGA tour and the sport of golf knows he is big
business. There'll be live coverage of that press conference on the BBC
News Channel at 4 o'clock this afternoon.

Coming up, I'm in Leicestershire where after centuries of getting it
wrong, historians have finally worked out the true location of one
of Britain's decisive battles. On BBC London: Fashion Week

McQueen. And celebrations at Craven Cottage
as Fulham keep their European It's almost a week since the start
of Operation Moshtarak, the major offensive against the Taliban in
southern Afghanistan. At a briefing at the Ministry of Defence this
morning, officials said the operation was on course, despite an
increase in Taliban resistance in recent days. Our world affairs
correspondent, Mike Wooldridge, was at that briefing and joins me now.
So who was there then and what it was tenor of what was being said?
This was a briefing given jointly by the Ministry of Defence, the
Foreign Office and the Department for International Development, all
very much involved in what they call this mission in southern
Afghanistan. The picture was one of a military operation that is
perhaps in many senses going according to plan. They
acknowledged that the level of resistance by the Taliban,
certainly in the last couple of days, had increased. There are
incidents they send across the board at the moment against British
and US forces and the Afghan forces working alongside them. But they
said that the level of this resistance was very much in line
with what was expected. They had, they insisted, been dist location
of the Taliban forces and these attacks were unco ordinated. A
development today. Some 200 elite Afghan policemen, the Afghan
gendarmerie, have been brought into this area. There'll be an effort to
try to hold important road crossings and bridges, to lead
towards the efforts to stabilise this area, which has been such a
strong Taliban area of resistance over the past year or two. Mike,
thank you. The Plaid Cymru leader, Ieuan Wyn
Jones, is expected to tell his party's spring conference in
Cardiff that in the event of a hung Parliament a vote for Plaid would
secure the best deal for Wales. The party has three MPs, but says its
target at the next election is to make that five. Mr Jones will argue
that Plaid could play a key role if no party wins an overall majority.
The Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, has predicted that her party
will make a truly historic breakthrough in the general
election. Speaking at its spring conference, she told delegates that
the Greens will win their first seat in Parliament. We are going to
Westminster to make a difference, to open the doors for all of those
that we represent, the hold the Government and Parliament to
account, to show that you can stick to your principles and get things
done. That is why we are here. That is the responsibility we want to
take up on May 7th. It's 25 years since the nation
first heard this... THEME MUSIC TO EASTENDERS
Eastenders, of course, has turned out to be one of the most
successful soap operas ever, with millions tuning in week in, week
out, to follow the torrid lives of Den and Angie, Dot Cotton, the
Mitchell family and the like. Tonight the programme celebrates
its Silver Jubilee with a live episode. Lizo Mzimba has been
following rehearsals, and joins me from Albert Square. Welcome to a
slightly sunny Albert Square. This is where it's all going to be
happening in just a few hours' time. Viewers over the years have been
well used to following what happens here, but tonight for the first
time they'll be able to watch events as they unfold, as they
broadcast a 25th anniversary special to commemorate a show which
since it began in 1985 has been nothing less than a national
nothing less than a national institution.
Oh, it stinks in here, doesn't it? From its opening moments it became
one of the most talked about shows on TV.
The intention was to reflect the issues that real people faced in
their lives, and its mix of gritty plots alongside more light hearted
story lines made it a hit with millions of viewers. Nice of you to
drop, in Ethel. At present we are on 3.96 recurring garments...
only actor to have appeared continuously since episode one says
statistics that variety which has statistics that variety which has
kept him in Albert Square. You are an actor in a soap you get to
portray a wider variety of emotions and character traits than you ever
do in a smaller drama series. I like it here. It's always something
fresh. The programme is nothing less than a national institution.
That has got to be the sickest joke that you've ever played and den
Watts fell for it. It gained one of the biggest audiences ever when den
told Angie he was leaving her. my sweet, is a letter from my
solicitor telling you that your husband has filed for divorce.
Happy Christmas, Ang. One of the reasons for the show's enduring
popularity habits willingness to tackle major issues. In 1988 there
was the rape of Kathy Beale. Please, let me go. No. For the character of
Mark foul ter it was living with HIV. I'm what they call HIV.
HIV? Yeah. HIV. And more recently the sexual abuse
of teenager Whitney Dean by her stepfather was a major story line.
Either you lie or I go back to prison, is that what you want, to
go back to prison? But the things that have got most people talking
over the years have been The Who done its, who fathered Michelle's
baby, who shot Phil Mitchell. Today we'll be revealing the mystery of
who killed arch archery Mitchell. And that's no surprise. A live
broadcast of this type is a huge undertaking, especially as they
know millions upon millions will be watching.
There are in the middle of one of their final rehearsals. It's a very
complex event to get right. The other thing that's a huge challenge
is keeping the identity of the killer of archery a secret. They've
rehearsed ten scenarios with ten different performers. Only a few
minutes before they go on air will they be told you are the murderer,
on live TV. After years of argument and debate,
archaeologists have finally revealed the correct location of
the Battle of Bosworth. They believe they may have also
identified the exact place where Richard III killed by Henry Tudor's
forces, in August 1485, the decisive moment in the Wars of the
Roses. Ben Godfrey is in Leicestershire.
The battle of boss wort was one of the most defining moments in
British history. It heralded the start of the Tudor dynasty, but
proof today that historians can get things wrong. It's taken them so
long, but with advances in new techniques in inearthing some of
the things behind us they say this is where the battle took place.
The battle of Bosworth field was the last time an English King,
Richard III, was killed leading an Army in the field. The year was
1485. His crown passed to Henry Tudor. For centuries it was widely
thought it happened here, at Ambion Hill near Market Bosworth in
Leicestershire. But no more. Two miles away this is Crown Hill, Glen
Foard and his team have spent four years digging away. They are
certain it happened here. If you had been here on 22nd August, 1485,
you would want to keep your head down, was there would be lead
flying through the air. These lead shots were discovered last year.
They are the largest collection from any medieval battlefield in
Europe, fired from shotguns that helped end the Wars of the Roses.
This silver gilt brooch of a boar is a clue. This would probably have
been worn by a knight who rode with King Richard when he was killed.
It's come as a surprise to the Oliver family, the landowners, who
has have had the farm for three generations. It was out of the blue.
You can only live with the excitement of it. And hope people
enjoy what we've got now. Experts have more work to do, not least how
to tell tourists that the true battleground is a bisc two mile
walk from the Bosworth Heritage Centre.    brisk. There are
concerns by some experts that people with metal detectors will
plund ter sites but they tell me there are no Treasury yours left
here, only new found knowledge about how they'll analyse and
research in the future and even how it is taught in schools.
These pictures in from Birmingham airport show the wintry weather
isn't relenting. The airport managed to re open early this
morning after being closed overnight. There've been delays to
rail services elsewhere in the rail services elsewhere in the
Midlands and the North West. John Hammond joins us.
It is just going on and on. Thanks for your pictures. This was from
Jane in Worcestershire. There was a good deal of snow around. And
there's been major disruption in places. Here was the feature, the
thick cloud that brought the snowfall across Wales and central
England. It is moving away. In its wake we see welcome sunshine. But
there are a scattering of snow showers, notably across the north 
east of Scotland, more ray, Aberdeenshire, Angus. A severe
weather warning here of snow piling up. But the rest of Scotland bright.
Lingering fog in Glasgow. Northern England bright and sunny this
afternoon. One or two sleet and snow showers but nothing as
disruptive as yesterday. Not helping the temperatures much, 4 6
degrees at best. When the showers come along temperatures tumble to
freezing. Wintry showers in southern England over the moors,
and Wales as well. Rain along the coastal fringe. A peppering of
showers for Northern Ireland. These could give a covering over higher
ground. A wintry afternoon as we go into
the night. It turns very cold indeed. Frost will be the main
theme nationwide. A hard frost. As in recent nights in the glens of
the Highlands, will minus 15 or mine hus 16 is feasible. For most
of us, minus 1 to minus 4 degrees, with fog patches.
A bright and sunny start to the weekend for most of us. But not all.
The south west: an area of wintry showers. Rain, sleet and snow
moving across southern counties through the day. That could give a
covering in some places. That's one to watch.
Further north a few wintry showers but plenty of sunshine. It will be
cold at 3 4 degrees. We could see snow across the South
East for a time tomorrow evening. That should ease away. Another
frosty night tomorrow night into Sunday morning.
More fun and games, another area of snow developing from the South West
pushing into the cold air, a frontal feature. It looks as if it
will move into northern England. In its wake, maybe less cold, turning
back to rain. It's going to be one of those weekends. All to play for.
A wintry mix: rain, snow, and A wintry mix: rain, snow, and
hopefully sunshine as well. The top story: leading economists
have backed Labour's plans to delay spending cuts in an effort to bring
the economy back on track. However, the Conservatives say any delay
