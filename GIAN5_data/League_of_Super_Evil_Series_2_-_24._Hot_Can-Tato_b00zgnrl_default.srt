It's incredible! The newspaper has some kind of future telling device!
It's just a horoscope.
Oh, really, Frogg? Well, let's see.
"You visit somewhere dark, today."
Wow, what does yours say?
Well, see, I'm not convinced   that monster was pink. Definitely pink.
Muh hah hah hah!
  Eee!
  Oof! Uh!
  Huh?
  Whaah!
  Ow!
  Aargh!
Raar hah hah hah!
Foolish humans of Earth, prepare yourselves
for the most exciting news, ever!
After a lifetime of mayhem and wilful destruction,
I, the mighty Skullossus,
have decided to give back to the community...
thrill a minute opportunity to visit my forbidden space station.
That's right, folks, inside specially marked cans
lies a single, slimy, gooey,
mind numbingly gross, brownish ticket.
Whoever finds it will be teleported
to evil wonders beyond their wildest imagining.
Swe e e et!
Ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
Whoa ha ha ha ha!
  Whah!
  Aieee!
Hee hee hee!
Co o ol!
Oh, and a catered lunch will be provided.
So, run, don't walk to your nearest purveyor of synthetic meat product.
May the power of badness be with you.
Muh hah hah hah!
Excellent. Everything is going according to plan.
Soon, I will be rid of these disgusting cans
of synthetic meat product and get my money back.
Hmm, last time I take investment advice from a Skullmando.
Let the synthetic, ham flavoured, meat selling bonanza begin!
Raar hah hah hah hah!
Skullossus' space station   here we come.
I can't believe we're going to live out our evil dreams.
This is the greatest day of my life!
Aw! Too bad there's four of us but only one slimy, gooey,
mind numbingly gross, brownish ticket.
Wait, what?
Only one of us will get to live out our evil dreams.
What, in the name of evil, is that?
  What? Where?
  What? I don't see anything!
Wait a minute!
I'd love to stay and chat but I've got a date
with a slimy, gooey, mind numbingly gross, brownish ticket.
He's getting away!
Muh hah hah hah!
Oh my!
He's going to buy every can before we can get there.
Hee hee hee!
What? Don't you even think about it!
  Oooh!
  There's no need to rush.
I'm sure there'll be plenty
of almost real canned meat for everybody.
Don't bet on it. Whoo ha ha ha!
  Huh?
To the Mall o Mart, please.
What? No!
I'll be sure to send you a postcard...from the space station.
Chocks away!
Curses!
Ha ha ha! Bye bye.
Whaaaah! BANG
Ye es! No time to lose.
Hey, that's my ride.
Must...win...contest. What?
No ticket.
I hope you all have extreme flatulence for weeks
and a shortage of two ply toilet paper.
Tee hee! Tee hee hee!
Game on, Doktor Frogg!
Hey, I'm going to make it. I'm going to make it!
Eh...
..ooft!
Hey, guys.
Co o ol!
There was no reason to rush, after all.
Out of my way!
Bad Doomageddon, you...
ate everything. HE BURPS
Oh, he probably ate the slimy, brown ticket, too.
No!
It's OK, Voltar.
I'm sure there'll be other contests for us
to mindlessly compete over.
Yeah, I guess we were being pretty ridiculous.
But I wanted to win this one!
Hey, I've got an idea. Come on!
Whenever I'm feeling blue, I just eat some soggy canned spinach.
Always cheers me up.
Bleaurgh! Spinach!
Here we go. Oh, whoopsy daisy!
Looks like someone misfiled this can. I'll notify the stock guy.
That's a can of Skullossus ham flavoured meat product.
It is? Hey, you're right.
They haven't announced the winner, yet. It might be in this very can.
It is!
So...beautiful.
Wow!
Mine!
Mine now! A ha ha!
  Oh, sorry.
  Ow ow!
Gotcha!
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
Here I come, Skullossokid.
Yee ha!
There he is. Hooray!
Whoa!
I got it!
Whoa!
Oh! Our can!
Mmmm! Ham flavoured, simulated meat product   my favourite.
Oh, no!
Congratulations! You are the lucky winner.
Now stand still for teleportation. This thing can be a little tricky.
Oh!
She's leaving with my ticket!
  We did it!
  We all did!
  Whoohoo!
  Yes!
Congratulations, foolish humans and thank you
for helping me get rid of my endless supply of disgusting canned meat.
As you have no doubt guessed, there will be no guided tour.
You can look out the window but don't touch anything.
Raar hah hah hah!
Oh, I almost forgot, your catered lunch is over there.
And there's an assortment of Skullossus T shirts,
coffee mugs and key chains available for purchase in our gift shop.
Thank you.
I demand free reign of this entire space station.
I want to have fun...or else I'll...I'll...
You'll what?
I'll tell you what a nice space station you got there,
old buddy, old pal.
A ha, I think we'll be going now.
Thanks for the visit, Mr Skullossus, sir.
What a waste of time!
Not quite, Frogg. Look what I got!
Oh! Crispy Cracks! Where'd you get those?
Swiped them from the free buffet.
Inside specially marked bags, is a crispy, yellow ticket.
Whoever finds the ticket gets to ride
  Gimme!
  Gimme!
  Gimme!
  Gimme!
