Good morning.
Mum.
This is a nice surprise.
  Trouble in paradise, is it?
  Mum...
  What?
Am I not allowed to ask my son why he's sleeping on our sofa?
You've left Christian?
No. We had a disagreement, I went for a walk and then...
And then you didn't want to return. I understand.
Morning, Syed...and everyone.
I don't think he needs breakfast in bed?
  He can come to the kitchen like everyone else.
  Ooops.
Welcome home, bro.
Morning, Hev.
Tea to take away, please.
Pops!
Hey! What you doing here?
  Make that to have in, will you? You hungry?
  Yeah.
A couple of bacon sarnies as well, please, stick it on my slate.
I don't know if I can.
I called the home, they said you got back all right.
You didn't say nothing, did ya?
As if. You did the right thing. Scarper quick and dodge the bullets,
that's what I say. I've had a bit of practice myself, over the years.
  Really?
  Oh, yeah.
You could tidy up before you go to work.
Afia's got to be at the Argee Bhajee for a flour delivery, I have got to go to the shop...
the least that you could do is tidy up before you leave.
  Mum, I'll tidy up.
  Fine.
  See you soon, sweetheart.
  I won't be long.
  You can leave her alone for two minutes.
  You should look after your brother.
  I'm OK.
  You're not. You look terrible.
Go up and have a shower. You, lend your brother some clothes.
I don't want a change of clothes.
Isn't this wonderful? Having the house full again.
It's about time things started to go right for us for a change.
Actually, you know what,
why don't I cook us a welcome home dinner, all right?
These two will be at work, so it'll be the two of us.
We'll have a lovely evening, just the two of us.
Just the two of us...
I'm not sure I can play the dutiful son any more.
We can make it if we try...
Sorry.
I was going to ring but I thought face to face was best.
Yeah well, makes a change from off your face I suppose.
Sorry. But I didn't do anything terrible, did I?
No, no, you were just your usual self. Drunk and hopeless.
I had a drink or two.
Yeah, and then you just went missing.
Don't tell me where. I don't want to know.
You've had enough, imagine what it's like to be me.
I hate being me, Tan.
  I look at you and you're all...
  You didn't take any drugs?
I'm stupid, but I'm not that stupid, I promise.
What are we going to do with you?
You could cheer me on.
What?
My drugs group. We've got this ceremony tonight.
What, a prize for the member who's drunk the most?
  Sorry.
  Six months clean of drugs.
Six months?
Already?
I know I ain't been a saint, but I have been a good girl, ain't I?
Yes. I must be mad. Yes, of course, I'll come.
Really?
Yes, I promise. I've got to go to work. Help yourself. I know you will.
Thanks, Tan.
I'll have to repaint the whole front or it won't match.
  Fine, I'll tell my insurance company.
  Good.
  Is that it? We done?
All right.
Is that all you've got to say, Mr Hamilton?
Well, yeah... No, no.
I'm sorry about your window, Mr Beale.
I can't believe you're such a rubbish driver. Are you honestly going to let him get away with it?
I've had words and I'll have a few more, don't worry.
I won't skimp on this repair either, make sure your premiums are paid up.
It's trade insurance. Unless reglazing a window's Â£1 million you'll be all right.
Dad, come on, we're late.
  All right. Where you two off to? Going to revisit the scene of the crime?
  The crime of what?
Being a passenger?
  I saw that! Why did you just shake your head at her.
  What you talking about?
They're in collusion.
Nah, we were in a collision. Get your wordage right. He's a weirdo.
She's been here five minutes, already got the measure of you.
If you were just a passenger why did you run away?
Practising for the marathon, late for me bedtime, dying for the loo. Take your pick.
Come on.
A warning, if my employee weren't driving, my insurance won't pay out.
  You what?
  If it's an under age driver behind the wheel we'll both be out of pocket.
Dad. Come on, we're going to be late for school again.
Yeah, all right, all right!
  I could take him if you want.
  Really?
  If that's OK by you, Bobby? Got nothing better to do.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
I can collect him after, take him home, give him his tea.
  You don't mind.
  No.
  Brilliant! Thanks, have a good day at school. See you later.
  Here you go.
  Listen, the big thing is, she's stayed clean, ain't she?
  She'll want to move back in.
  You don't know that.
  Where else is she going to go?
What's the betting she turning up at ours later, hog the remote and ruin our evening?
  She's got something on tonight.
  Good. We can lock the door,
unplug the phone, and let her sort herself out for once.
  The thing is, I did promise...
  No, no, no. Tonight is Tanya and Greg night. Unplugged.
It's just half an hour. Sorry.
Sorry.
Oi! You do know Christian's in pieces, right?
Keep out of it, Rox.
Didn't I tell you, Syed?
You got any doubts, you tell Christian up front. Not when you're halfway through the adoption.
It takes time to realise. You've seen those stickers? A dog is not just for Christmas.
A kid's for life. You should know that.
Give him a break, just cos he's not as broody as your mate.
  What do you know?
  Surely you've got enough in your own life without poking your nose into his.
  Meaning?
  Possibly meaning Ronnie?
  Girls, please.
  Shut your mouth.
Christian is in a right state and it's down to you, OK?
Sorry about that.
Don't be silly, it's not your fault.
Tan, you don't have to join in every ruck you see.
  All right.
  Syed, you're right, for what it's worth.
  It's hard enough for a normal couple to get it right.
  Sorry?
  Two blokes. A kid needs a mother.
I'm sorry, ignore him. He's stuck in the '80s.
  I'm sticking up for him, not getting against him.
  Of course not.
See you back at the salon.
I have a toddler, Georgie. You'll have to meet him.
  Is he my cousin?
  No, no, no, no, Hev's just a mate.
When I say, "just"...
You know what I mean.
Complicated, innit?
So, what's the big panic?
Billy's got someone he wants you to meet.
  Is that it? I thought it was urgent.
  Phil, this is Lola.
My granddaughter.
You all right?
You've already met Jay, ain't ya?
You're my uncle, brother, or summat like that?
Oh, no, no, Jay's not blood related.
No? Nice one.
Know what they say, can't choose your family,
but you can get really, really close to your friends.
Big day, innit?
Emotional.
I'm sorry about your son.
Thank you, Heather. No one's said that.
Billy hasn't given it much thought, too busy looking after Lola.
Got to make the most of her now you've found her.
I didn't find her. Billy did, I just went along with it.
  He loves her, you can see that.
  He doesn't know her.
Yeah, but you soon will. When she's living with you.
There's no way she's living with us. That would be good for me and Billy, wouldn't it(?) I don't think.
You won't learn any life lessons from Billy, except how to be a good loser.
  I'm doing all right.
  You keep telling yourself that.
He's got a lovely heart, look how he is with his granddaughter.
  I ain't done nothing yet.
  Introducing her into the family.
  Not many people would do that.
  Thanks.
Most people would worry about taking on a teenager, wouldn't they?
  Like Julie. But Billy, he doesn't think twice.
  Like Julie?
Put the shovel away, Hev, will you?
That what you said?
I get things wrong all the time, I'm sorry, Lola, you know...
Don't worry about it, cos I ain't in love with her, neither.
So, going to show me around?
Thank you, Ian. For the advance, but I won't be needing it any more.
Do you mind!
And now that that's settled, I thought maybe you and I could talk about business?
I don't think so.
Only, well I'm looking to buy an investment property or two,
or maybe open a business, or maybe... well, who knows?
Janine, I just came in here for a nice quiet drink, OK?
So just tell me,
what does a girl do with a great big fat fortune?
I don't know, and I don't care.
  Sorry, I didn't hear you knock.
  Christian.
You're still moving?
Not that it's got anything to do with you any more.
Why wouldn't I?
Did you call the social worker?
You told me to, didn't you?
I know. I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry, are you, yeah? Sorry for what?
For chickening out or for ruining his life?
Roxy, just go and pick up Amy?
  I've got plenty of time.
  How about now? We need to talk in private.
  Yeah?
What, sweep it all under the rug?
You never even came out the closet, just opened up the door and waved your little fingers at the world.
Everyone has arguments. This isn't about being gay.
Yes, it is, because deep down, you are just like your old dear, aren't you?
You don't think two men should have a baby together.
Roxy. Please.
He deserves better.
I'm sorry.
I know how much you want a kid.
It's all right.
Because it's not going to stop me.
What?
I could be approved as early as next year.
Right. But...
if you want a child and I don't, where does that leave us?
I'm not doing this any more, Sy.
Why should I have to give up my dreams just to stay in this relationship?
My dream of being a father.
So what, we're finished?
I don't know, Sy. Are we?
Just grow up, all right.
It's time to make your own decisions, and stick to it.
What, and that's it?
I've got nothing else to say. I'm walking out of this flat to get one with my life.
Making my life ready for a child. Your stuff is over there,
and rest of your clothes, they're in the wardrobe.
Look how high I can go.
Another independent career woman, just what I was looking for!
Sorry?
You must get all the gossip sitting in that shop.
Businesses closing, properties for sale.
And what, you would like me to be your spy?
Why is everyone just so prickly today?
Who said anything about spying?
Think I'll report back to you, think again.
Well, your loss. Do you want to come to my party at the R&R next Monday?
  Busy, sorry.
  Free champagne on entry.
Oh, no.
Are you meant to be looking after him?
Tut tut. Child neglect.
Darling, that is a nasty graze, innit, sweetheart?
Come on, let's get you back to my house, shall we?
Cool. Mega wounded. You wait till the kids at school see that.
They'll be like "Wow! Sick!"
You're mad you, ain't ya?
And you love it!
See you round, sexy.
Another 20, and another 20,
and another one.
The service, the crem, everything, give him the damn money.
All right, then there's 20 for flowers from the family.
Want me to pay for all of them?
  Oh. Well...
  What with it saying on the card,
"Love from Ricky, Carol and all the family."
Priceless.
Look Pat, if that's the way she wants to be.
I'm going to make the most of my money. I'm not going to just throw it away like some people.
I might splash out a little bit at first, you know.
A party, I thought. At the R&R.
Next Monday.
And we're invited?
Oh, yeah.
Family, friends,
enemies.
Well, the last lot'll be queuing round the block.
I don't understand what you've got against her.
I don't know her, but when I see her I think of my baby.
How can you think about him? You didn't even know him.
I held him in my arms, Billy, and sometimes I still feel him there.
And actually, I do know her.
Me and you both know kids like her.
Rough, tough little bullies.
Lola's not our problem.
Whose problem is she, then?
Cos we're the only ones who'll love her, aren't we?
I don't love her.
I can't love her. I don't even want to love her.
She's your own flesh and blood.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
If you make Billy choose between me or you, I'll win.
You're a hard faced little girl.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
  There she is!
  Here I am.
  All right?
Yeah. Can we go to that little caff? I'm starving.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Course we can. You coming, Ju?
No, I just asked her.
Right, come on then.
See you, Grandma.
I mean, I know it's only a little thing, you know, a made up certificate...
No, it's not. It's great. Something to be really proud of.
Yeah, I know.
Six months clean, eh!
Be happy for me, then.
I am. Look. See?
What is it? Jay?
He's... It doesn't matter.
You'll sort it out. Young love and all that.
But what if he finds someone else before it's sorted?
Or what if someone else's already after him?
What? He ain't going to find anyone half as gorgeous as you.
So, do you have to give a speech at this thing then?
Some do, some don't.
And there's this bit where we thank our supporters with, like, flowers.
So I thought I'd call your mum up.
Oh, she'd love that!
Listen, I'm going to get going, cos I'll be late.
Wish me luck, yeah!
There you are, sit down there.
You all right, Abi?
  Hi.
  You all right?
You've met Lola, ain't you?
Excuse me.
Don't forget to charge up your mobile.
What?
Mitchell.
What are you having?
  I would have actually brought him back home for you.
  Hi, Dad.
  You all right, son?
  Yeah. Deep crust pepperoni pizza.
  Not the pizza. Your leg. Is it all right?
  Yeah. I'm going to have a great big scab.
Is that why you've come over? Who told you?
Apparently you were stood there gossiping.
Oh, right. Janine. Say no more.
But you were supposed to be looking after him.
I'm sorry. Janine made it sound like his leg was hanging off.
Yeah, well, she would.
I don't know what it is with her, she gets to me. She said Bobby was crying and I wasn't there...
it made me feel bad.
Yeah, well,
not as bad as her fashion sense, eh?
Yeah.
Syed.
How's things?
Where do I start?
Fabulous, fantastic.
financially perfect.
Come on.
Thanks for this, Pat. You know what,
I've been walking round garages all day, no one wants to know.
Long day job hunting? That's not fair when some people have money chucked at them.
I'll have orange juice please, Tracey, and a G&T. Double.
Ricky, if I had the cash, I'd set you up in your own little repair shop.
If nobody's taking on mechanics it would suggest car repairs isn't the best business to be in.
  Or it would seem that way to anyone with an active brain cell.
  I wasn't talking to you.
She's got ears like a bat, hasn't she?
Hey, everybody,
did you all hear about the party going on at the R&R on Monday?
A free glass of champagne,
loads of free nibbles.
So, I'll see you all there, yeah?
No, OK, well, I tell you what,
seeing as I'm feeling generous,
it's a free bar, all right?
Free drinks, all night. On me.
Getting desperate?
Too late to change your mind, Pat.
I've hired a bouncer to keep the rough trade out.
So,
how's work?
You busy?
Ticking over.
So with a bit of investment you could just fly.
And this is your chance to work with an investor.
I'm not sure that's the way I want to go.
Why not?
I mean, you're young, fit, stylish, ambitious.
You could be living the dream.
Look, with my money, all right, you could open a spa in Soho.
Nothing's ruled out, Syed, because nothing is ruled in!
Erm...hello?
Sorry. Excuse me.
Oh, hello, mate. You can see yourself in one of these, can't you? No?
You might as well get off.
What, it's only like...
I know, I got a meeting, take an early bath.
  I don't mind staying on, or locking up.
  Well, that was the plan.
One of the reasons you're here.
But you'll be a very old man, before I trust you with these motors again.
Boss, what can I say?
Try, "Mr Branning, I find you strangely attractive, see you in the morning."
Mr Branning, I find you strangely attractive, see you in the morning.
Lovely. Behave yourself.
  Don't you hate it when people don't pick up?
  Who?
A client. Have a sandwich and a beer, I'll make something proper when I get back.
  Where are you going?
  Rainie's meeting.
What happened to Tanya and Greg, unplugged?
Don't be silly. I'll be a half hour, tops.
Get yourself that beer. I'll be back before you know it.
Hello?
Where are you?
  What time do you call this?
  I'm sorry.
I know, I did try and call your mobile but...
  I can't stay.
  Shush.
  I can't stay, honestly.
  Shush.
  Honestly, I promised Rainie. Seriously,
I can't stay, Max.
Did anyone ever tell you, you talk too much?
Through there.
Billy's taken her out for something to eat. They won't be long.
You haven't parked outside, have you?
  Round the corner.
  And they won't know who phoned, no?
  No, no, no, no.
  We just want to get her back where she belongs.
She's so cute. My Aunty Janet.
You can call her your sister if you like.
If it makes it easier to get your head round.
Aunty, sister, don't matter. And this is William.
Yep, that's my boy.
I like kids. I'm good with them. That ain't a lie.
I can see that.
Congratulations, Rainie!
  I should have known you wouldn't be here.
  No, I was, I was!
I came a tiny bit late so I just sneaked in the back. I've been watching. Did you hear me cheering?
You're a terrible liar, ain't ya? There you go.
That's for being a wonderful sister.
If you're blonde or a little bit tarty then come...
I'm not blonde.
Thought you were Roxy.
I know what I want.
It's just taken me a while...
I've been an idiot.
I'm going to be a father, Sy.
Yeah.
Me too.
You sure?
I'm sure.
Lola?
What are you doing here?
We're here to take you home.
  How did you know how to find her?
  Does it matter?
Ian Beale. Got to be.
Look, she wasn't driving that car.
  Billy.
  What car? Someone called to say she was missing from the children's home. That's all I know.
Anonymous call, was it?
Ian Beale.
Come on, Lola, no tantrums, eh?
Look, mate, we're her only relatives. We'll accept responsibility for her.
I'm sorry, your partner's already agreed.
It was her. She grassed me up.
Julie?
  I didn't.
  Liar!
I didn't, Billy.
All right, on you go.
Just leave her with me, will ya?
She'll only run away again, you know she will.
You can't have a young girl on the streets, on her own.
  I'll come straight back. You watch.
  100% Mitchell.
It's for the best, Billy.
I don't want to hear another thing out of you.
I can't even bear to look at you.
