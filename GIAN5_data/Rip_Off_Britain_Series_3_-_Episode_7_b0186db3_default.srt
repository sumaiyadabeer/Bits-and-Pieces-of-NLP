coast of insurance is hitting you hard. Recent figures from the A

You might expect the price of car insurance to vary bait depending on
where you live but some you have have discovered by living in
certain post codes you can end up virtually uninsurable. That is what
happened to the driver we are about to meet. He lives in Bradford where
the car insurance has risen more sharply than anywhere else. So much
so some districts have been blacklisted. You will get a quote
that is impossibly high or they won't give you one at all. Even if
you are one of the best drivers in town. Driving has been a big part
of Richard Summerscale's life and that doesn't just apply to steering
a trolley round his local cash and carry. The sandwich shop owner
admits he's couldn't be without his car. It is his lifeline, for runger
rands and stocking up on supplies for his business. I would be lost.
There is no way I could do deliveries, pick up the required
bits we need, you know the shopping, cash and carry, and generally
getting about town. He has years of experience behind the wheel. In
fact he would have a good claim to be among Britain's safest drivers.
I was in West Yorkshire Police for 15 years. Part of the time I spent
in the road traffic department. I went on advance driving course,
accident investigation which mean I can see things before normal drives.
It is no surprise he believes he's is low risk when getting insured.
He had been with esure for fiv years and was happy with them until
last year, when despite no new claims or conviction, the former
traffic cop's policy was set to go up from �156, to �885. The first
reply is because that is what the computer said. I wasn't happy soy
pushed it further. They said they were getting a lot of claims in
Bradford, I said not from me! Richard took his business elsewhere.
The best he could get was a �317 policy with another company. And
when 12 months on that looked like it was going to creep up too, he
decided to see what his previous insurer esure could quote this time.
As soon as I spoke to the person, gave me detail, went through the
quote and they say sorry, we are unable to quote in your postcode
area. Despite the fact that esure insured him in the past, they were
now refusing to. Richard was furious. At being classed as a
driver who was uninsurable. I was ensensed. I had paid my premium on
time all the previous year, they were happy to ache my money.
Suddenly it becomes not as economical. Plenty of other local
drives experienced the same thing. So many after being inundated with
complaints from stit wents Bradford east MP David Ward conducted a
city wide survey. He found over the last three years the 511 people who
took part saw their premiums rise by 63%. What people are saying is
why it is that I have lived in this area for year, I haven't changed,
in fact I may have improved as a driver, and had yet another year of
no claims, no accidents at all, and still my insurance premiums are
going up. It isn't fair. Esure told us that Richard's original premium
of �146 was down to an error by one of their staff who applied a
discount that he wasn't entitled to Richard should have been pay morgue
than double that but their explanation for the huge increase
to �885 and their refusal to insure him again is one that you will hear
from most insurance companies. They say a surge in personal injury
claims and pay outs have pushed up premiums for everyone, leading to
companies like esure temporarily suspending offering new policys in
the worst affectedary tkwhra, is why Richard was left uninsurable.
Because although this is a national problem in Bradford whiplash claims
are six times the national average fpblt there has been a large
increase in the number of personal injury claim but the amount per
claim is going up. So we need to identify certainly how can we
reduce the cost of claims, of making claims, but also look at the
number of claims that are taking place, particularly those that are
deemed to be fraudulent claim, the increase in the whiplash kaim cases
that are coming forward, is reaching an unsustainable level.
Across the country the number of personal injury claims has rocketed.
Number of accidents is down. Many say that is because the so called
compensation culture is encouraging people to make claims whether they
have been seriously injured or not. The whole industry has sprung up to
encourage that. Claims management companies and some insurers can
earn huge referral fees by selling on the details of people involved
in accident, to Ieuan Wyn Jones no fee lawyers who can typically made
�1350 for themselves on a whiplash settlement. The Government has
announced it intends to ban referral fees and to reform the no
win no fee system. But, I have to say that is little consolation for
drivers facing soaring premise yourpls like Richard refused all
together. If they are having claims that cost too much they are the
problem, not the innocent careful drivers that can't get insurance or
ridiculous premiums. The Government has said it plans to ban referral
fees in personal injury claims. As we have heard, they are reckoned to
be one of the key factors in the soaring costs. It is hoped this
will happen some time in 2012. So let us fee the savings the industry
is expected to make as a result really do make a difference to our
premiums. And we were talking more about car insurance later on, but
next, parking fines. I know that one of your biggest bugbear, I can
see you going argh! Especially when the charge doesn't seem fair. Here
is a classic example of that. People who didn't park anywhere
they shouldn't but still got tickets totalling thousands of
pounds, and indeed are being chased by debt collector, when all they
have done is drive legitimately to their own homes. Hannah has a funny
feel sheing is being watched. Every day, she has a sensation that
someone, somewhere knows exactly what she is doing. They watch me
coming in, they watch me when I leave, 24 hours a day. Musician

Manchester. Her only access to her property is through the back.

to go past them every time I leave the flat. It is frustrating.
what is it she is so angry about? These. ANPR cameras are automatic
number plate recognition cameras, which are positioned right outside
her house. The service the car park and are operated by Excel Parking,
which is a private parking company. Only they don't just photograph the
cars in the car park. When I drive in through the road to the cash
park my car is clocked by their camera because I don't buy a ticket
because I am coming in, that sends a message, they send me a fine
which goes up to �100. The problem is that the cameras cannot
differentiate between the cars coming into park, and those who are
just driving through. As a result, Hannah says she and her flat mate
and all the visitors have between them managed to wrack up more than
50 tickets which comes to more than �5,000 in fines. Hannah hasn't paid
as she doesn't think she should have to. As far as she is concerned
there is no other way for her to get on to her driveway. The letters
are aggressive. I reply pilotly, then I ignore any future
correspondence they send me. It is different if you live here. You
feel responsible for friend, family, who visit, who get tickets, you
feel you have to warn them in advance, if you get a ticket in the
next few weeks don't pay it. That sets them on the path of months of
faff with Excel. Her friend and fellow musician Aine has had two
tickets. The company waived the first fine she disputed but they
have not been so accommodating with the second one. I sent the same I
mail and they refused to waive that one. On my second e mail I provied
them with a photograph of my carton driveway. This is nine months ago,
the car is registered to my dad and he is being chased by debt
collectors for the fine which is �100 he gets phone calls from them
every day. Hannah contacted Excel with her registration number and
for six months the letters and charges stopped. When she got a new
car they started piling up again. Within the first two months of
having the new car we had about five or six tickets. It got
ridiculous. We decided the try and take a different tack and see what
rights we had for living here. So we contacted local councillors to
see if they could put a stop to it P Councillor Victor Chamberlain has
agreed to him. He says because motorist worst age to use as a cut
through for 40 years they should be able to do so again. What I am
doing is working with residents and the MP to get the Manchester City
Council to recognise the established right of way, and we
are hoping this will mean that residents won't be impacted in the
future because they won't, they have the right to access their
driveway. Without being charged. But Excel Parking are taking a hard
line on this. They dispute Hannah's version of event, particularly in
regard to the number of tickets they have issued and point out they
have cancelled many of the charge notices on appeal. But in any case,
they stress they are the rightful occupier and that there is no right
of way across the car park to any premises. With signs making it
clear that it is private property. They say they have been totally
reasonable with the resident, allowing them to register their
vehicles so they can be exempt and investing in additional technology
so they can filter the vehicles out. But they also say it is impossible
for them to identify vehicles which are not registered at these address,
or indeed keep up with changing tenants if they are not informed.
They refute any suggestion that their letters are aggressive and
stress they comply with all the requirements of the British Parking

competently. If, like them, you think you are being unfairly
charged or penalised or if you are being pursued for a payment that
you think is unjustified, then Michelle from Consumer Direct is
here with some great tips on what to do. If you need to make a
complaint about a company, there are a few things that you should do.
If you are unsure of your legal rights, then take some advice
before you speak to the company. It is important that you gather
evidence if you complain, so keep a record of any telephone calls that
you make and copies of any letters, and if the problem is about work
you have had done, perhaps take photographs. You should speak to
the company in question telling them what the problem is, remaining
polite but firm at all times. Tell them what you want them to do and
by when. Often speaking to them face to face will help you to
resolve the matter without any further redress. If speaking to the
company does not work, put your complaint in writing, tell them
what you want to do, what is wrong, and by when you want the problems
resolved. Keep a copy of your letter and get some proof of
postage if possible. If you are still unable to get the matter
resolved, then you may need to consider taking more formal action.
If the company is a member of an approved traders scheme or a trade
association, they may be able to offer you mediation or arbitration,
or you may be able to consider an ombudsman scheme or an alternative.
If you paid using credit or by credit card, and the goods or
services cost more than �100, your finance company may be jointly
liable and may be able to offer you further assistance. If your problem
remains unresolved, then take advice from Consumer Direct or your
local Citizens Advice Bureau. Earlier we heard how the cost of
car insurance has soared over the last 12 months and it is new
drivers who have been hit particularly hard. Their policies
have gone up by way more than the average and it is reckoned that
someone who has just got their licence will typically pay almost
double the amount they would have done last year. The industry puts
that down to a number of factors, including uninsured drivers and
those false claims the government hopes to crack down on. But
whatever their justification, the money most companies ask young
drivers to pay has left a whole generation feeling like they are
being priced off the road. Passing his driving test was a milestone
for Peter and his mother, Julie. As a young man of 17, it meant he was
on the road to independence. When I passed my test I was over the moon.
I could not believe it, really. I thought it was great that I could
finally go out and drive whenever I wanted to go. When Peter passed his
test I was overjoyed. I was thrilled to bits. I immediately
texted all my friends. I could not wait to get home and give him a big
kiss and congratulate him. It was fantastic. But their initial
excitement faded as soon as they started looking into the cost of
insurance. Some of them were �17,000, which at that point, you
just think, my God, what is going on? So, with quotes as high as
�17,000, Julie started to look at other options. She got a quote from
her insurance company to see how much it would cost to simply add
Peter to her own policy. But that was not cheap either. I was insured
at a good price of 500 odd pounds. I rang up asking if I could put my
son on as another named driver and the quote was �3,895. That would be
a whopping increase of �3,375, an amount that would put a massive
strain on their finances. It is not actually much less than my mortgage.
It would stand at about 350 a month, and on top of your finances, what
you have already got, outgoing, month after month, that is
astronomical. So Julie has not gone ahead with that. Peter may have
passed his test but he is still not on the road. Well, not without a
lift from Mum, anyway. My mates can drive and I cannot at the moment.
You want to go and drive, but you cannot. You can go out with your
mates, but it is not the same thing. You can be sat in the passenger
seat, but you just want to get your hands on the steering wheel and
drive yourself. Of course, Peter is just one of countless young drivers
facing exactly the same problem. You pay so much money for the
lessons and then they just cannot drive, can they? And that is all
they want to do, isn't it, just drive? Just down the road, Peter's
friend Rhys and his mother Joanne also struggled to find a quote they
could afford. When I started looking at quotes, I was really
shocked at the prices. The dearest one was �20,000, and I think the
cheapest one was �2,000 plus. Luckily for them, Rhys's father is
in the motor trade and he got a more reasonable quote through his
trader policy. I think that worked out at �860, which is still an
awful lot of money. The car is not really worth that. Another friend,
Chase, also feels priced out of the insurance market. How are you doing,
Chase, what are you going to do with your insurance? I am just
going to have to go on my mum's insurance to make it cheaper. On my
own, it is stupid money, about ten grand for myself. Quotes like these
are typical for teenage drivers. Insurance companies say it is
because statistics show that young drivers have more accidents. Simon
Douglas from the AA explains. they do have an accident, they do
tend to be more serious, and the average claim cost for a young
driver is something like �5,000 or more, whereas for an older driver
it is probably under �2,000. There is one option which could drive the
boys' premiums down. One thing you might want to consider is these new
insurance products, pay how you drive, where they fit the device in
the car that measures how you drive as an individual and they give you
a premium based on your own driving behaviour. Not the average for your
whole peer group. For some people, if you're willing to be measured in
this way, it can bring the cost of insurance down significantly.
the meantime, the situation leaves their parents wondering if there
was any point getting them lessons at this age. I just do not know
where we're going to go. I am gutted for him, just gutted. They
might as well just wait and let them get a job when they are 24, 25,
it might be slightly cheaper. Well, the one good thing to come
out of car insurance being so pricey is it has prompted a lot of
scrutiny about people in a position to do something about it. The
Office Of Fair Trading is currently investigating the issue and plans
to publish its findings later this month. If it decides the industry
is acting in an uncompetitive manner or treating customers
unfairly, it may take further action.
At a time when money is tighter than ever, you need to know that
your cash is working hard for you, avoiding rip offs and sharp

tell us what has left you feeling ripped off and we have been
inundated with your stories. And this year we were able to solve
some of your problems in person at the Rip Off Britain pop up shop.
You will find you can probably save hundreds of pounds each year on
your car and home insurance. Plus, we will have more examples of
spiralling insurance costs. Should you have to pay higher premiums if

Next, how a series of unfortunate mistakes can spiral out of control,
leaving one Rip Off Britain viewer paying more than she bargained for
when she moved 2.5 miles down the road. In January this year, Jean
and Bob Wharmby swapped life in a rural village just outside
Lichfield in Staffordshire for a modern home in a new housing estate
closer to town. They were looking forward to their retirement after
spending their working lives running a hotel. We decided to move
here because I knew the area, a lovely area, and convenient to the
city centre. After the move, Jean told her car insurance company Saga
about her change of address. But she was astonished to discover that
the move just 2.5 miles down the road was to have an unwelcome
impact on her premiums. She said, that is going to cost you a lot of
money. I said, why? She said, well, it is the area you are in. We go on
postcodes. So I said, how much is it going to cost me? Until August.
This is from January to August. She said, �159. I was astounded. I said,
I cannot understand why you say that because of the area and the
postcode. Apart from the address, there was no change to the policy,
no claims, and a clean licence. As she had already paid more than �300
for a full year's cover back in August 2010, Jean could not
understand why moving up the road should mean she should have to pay
�159 extra. But she had no choice. She said, well, if you do not pay
the extra, you car insurance will be cancelled.    your car insurance.
I said, but I have paid for a year, and she said, if you do not pay the
extra for where you are now, it will be cancelled. I was in shock,
really. Jean's husband, Bob, uses a different insurer for his car and
when he told them he had moved, there was no change to his premium.
Obviously because we were moving to a new house I telephoned my brokers.
Back came the reply that the insurance would be exactly the same,
no increase at all. I was absolutely amazed when Jean told me
that hers had gone up by 150 odd quid. I did feel that Jean was
being taken for a proverbial ride It turns out that at the heart of
all this is a series of simple mistakes, but it took ten months
and this programme getting involved before the mystery was solved. Saga
tell us that when Jean rang them with her new postcode, the agent
she spoke to unfortunately misheard it, and Jean did not pick up on
that when it was read back. As far as Saga is concerned, that is her
But does Jean deserve all the blame? She did later ring Saga
about her postcode again and the correct details did not make it
onto the company's systems that time either. Saga put that down to
an innocent error on their part. In fact, the situation was only
resolved when we got in touch with the company. Since then, Saga has
apologised to Jean, refunded the additional premiums, and given her
a further �100 compensation. So, is there anything you can do to try
and keep a lid on escalating car insurance premiums? Chas Hallett
from "What Car?" magazine has some advice. Of course, there are huge
number of factors insurance companies use when they are
calculating insurance. One of the ways you can save lots of money is
shop around. Do not just automatically renew your insurance.
Get on the internet, get on the phone, because you can save
hundreds of pounds by swapping insurers. Make sure your car is
valued correctly. Lots of insurance companies use bandings, so you
could say your car is worth 9,995, rather than �10,000, and that could
have a big difference on your insurance premium. You could also
make sure your car has all the right security systems on it. They
may be expensive, but things like alarm systems and electronic
trackers can reduce your insurance premium. Make sure you give the
insurance company your correct employment details because your job
and what you do for a living can have a big bearing on the cost of
insurance. Also, consider where your car is kept overnight. If you
have a garage or even a driveway, it can reduce your insurance
premium considerably. The other thing you could do is do not
overestimate the mileage you do for the year. The minimum number of
miles possible is the best for lower insurance premiums. We're
here in Manchester where Rip Off Britain have opened their very
first pop up shop. It has been a weekend of consumer advice from our
team of experts and BBC Learning have been helping people of all
ages improve their maths skills. But one area of our shop which has
been particularly busy is the video booth that we set up for people to
record their gripes and to get everything off their chests. The
biggest cause of complaint we have heard in the gripe box by far is
car insurance. My son is 18 and currently taking lessons. To insure
him on a 1.1 Vauxhall Corsa is going to cost in excess of �5,000.
They have put it up from 370 to 490. My eldest son, who has been having
driving lessons, and we wanted to insure him on our car so we could
take him out for additional driving experience, and we have been quoted
�4,000. It had gone up from �750 to just over 1,000. I had to pay
�2,000 just to insure it. What a rip off. That is a lot of car
insurance gripes. A real bugbear of yours when it comes to all sorts of
insurance is automatic renewal. Les popped in after he realised that
the automatic renewal quote from his insurer was �150 more expensive
than the same insurance for new customers. I thought, I will just
check and see if the prices are still reasonable, and when I
checked on the website, there was a massive difference in the price
that I was being quoted. So I rang the company to ask them why, why
was there a difference in the cover, was it something that I missed, and
there was nothing. The cover was They draw you in with that
attractive premium. Then they start trying to rash et it up in the
later years. You go on line and shop round, not with your existing
insurer, go on a comparison site and see what you could get. You
will find you can save hundreds each year on your car and home
insurance. All you have to do is pick up the phone and say I've had
a look round and realise I could get the same policy �100 cheaper.
They are often change it because they don't want to lose you. You
have to be prepared to shop round. There is no reward for loyalty.
Stay alert. Thank you for coming in I will use the advice I have been
given. For both the home insurance and for the car insurance, and for
Holiday Inn insurance as well. team of experts have been able to
help a lot of people here today. I hope that you at home have also
been able to pick up useful tips. Now back to car insurance. And we
have already heard how the cost of your premiums can be a bit of a
postcode lottery. There can be plenty of other factors that mean
you could pay a lot more, and they might have nothing at all to do
with how good a driver you are or whether you have had an accident.
It could come down to the whether you have a job. Aside from a home,
a car is one of the biggest investments most of us will ever
make. So it is important to look after it. Living in the heart of
the Peak District, having a car is vital for Martin, and now more than
ever, 12 months ago he lost his job and he has been busy looking for
another one ever since. The car is very important. I need it to pick
my daughter up. She lives eight miles away. I need it to go to the
Jobcentre, 13 miles away. The nearest town is eight miles away.
It is quite rural round here, no big shops. In June, when Martin
needed to renew his car insurance, he called Endsleigh to take them up
on the renewal quote they had sent. He was asked a few questions
including his current employment status. And then came the bombshell.
They said I was unemmind they would have to recalculate the premium.
They went away for a minute and it came back over �200 more than it
would have been if I had been employed, so I was completely, I
was astounded by it. I asked why, and they said, it was something to
do with their underwriters, that was it. The actual quote for
Martin's 1.3 litre car had gone up from just over � 350 to �565. That
is a 62% increase. The former IT manager says it can't be down to
his performance behind the wheel. Well, I've got over nine years no
claims, I've not had an accident in over ten year, I don't drive like
an it yacht. I'm mot a boy racer. I don't have a boy racer's car. It
was the fact I was unemployed. Martin decided to try elsewhere but
was shocked to find that he got the same response from other companies
when he tried to get quotes. found a lot of companies won't
insure unemployed drivers. I rang them up, asked them why, they said
it was they don't insure unemployed people. One was a famous
supermarket chain. They won't insure you. It made me mad because
I buy my shopping there why can't I buy insurance there? Very
frustrated he decided to sigh how Endsleigh's instant online quote
compared with what he had been offered over the phone. He tried
employing as an unemployed driver and was quoted a hefty �945 for the
year. That is �400 higher than his renewal quote. What would they have
charged if he had been working? Let's see, as Martin keys in his
previous employment details. quote is �380 which is ridiculous.
It is �600 less if I am employed than if I was unemployed. I am
astounded. It makes me feel a victim, or discriminated against
that I am unemployed. Martin couldn't understand why not having
a job made such a difference to his insurance. But searching on line
for arpbgs he found various possible explanations from other
drivers who had been in a similar situation. One of the reasons they
gave was that unemployed people have more time on their hands and
they travel more to interview, and another reason was because if you
are unemployed you are more likely to make a false claim to get more
money. It makes you feel like you're a criminal. Why would they
think you might make money out of a claim? I don't like my car gets
scratched. Insurance insiders say many factors are taken into
consideration. The new tyre, brake, perhaps theirs cred it rates isn't
as good. Cred it rating, the better it is the better the deal you get
from your bank. So they are rating factors that are considered by the
insurance company. We asked Endsleigh why Martin's job status
should affect premiums. And they said that though they work with a
range of insurers, they just the intermediary and don't set the
rates. While they take equality very seriously, they say certain
group, such as the unemployed, offer an increased risk,
statistically, and this can be reflected by some insurers and
higher rates. They said they are happy to speak to Martin to find
way forward. But they are too late. The only way he could find an
affordable premium and keep his car on the road was to agree to a �400
excess, with a different insurer. So for Martin, it has been a double
blow for his pocket. Not just losing his job and his income, but
in his eyes, being penalised by his insurance company for doing so. As
far as he is concerned his circumstances may have changed, but
his driving skills have not. If like many of our viewers you that
had to insure your car or get inu insurance for a younger member of
the family the premiums have probably made your eyes water. An
increase of 40% is commonplace and for young drivers they are being
quoted in the thousands. What is going on? I have come to the
Association of British Insurers hopefully to get some answers. I am
joined by Nick Starling the director of general insurance here
at the Association of British Insurers. Nick, car insurance gone
up by on average round 40%, what is going on? Car insurance has indeed
increased by a great deal in recent year, and that is three factor, the
increased instance of bodily injury claims people are making, it has
increased fraud and the problem of uninsured driving. Young people are
getting extortionate Premiers quoted, �12,000 in one case, why
are they so high? Unfortunately, a lot of young people in this country
are poor drivers, they are poorly train and the testing system is
failing them. Sadly, if you are a young male driver in particular,
you are ten times more likely than I am or you are to be killed or
seriously injured in an accident. At least one MP has called Britain
the whiplash capital of Europe. If you are aware that people are
claiming in some cases unjustifiably, why can your
association not actually clampdown on those insurance companies that
are making those claims possible? We can't ourselves clampdown on
what is happening with these claims. We have this compensation culture
which is leading people to think if they have had a minor accident they
can make a claim. We need to put a stop to it and enable premiums to
come down. You will know it is not people saying I think I will make a
claim. It is companies persuading them to do it. There is something
one has to say. If you have been injured, or made ill and it is not
your fault then you need to be helped. The problem is when that
has happened to you, you are a valuable property and lots of
people want to get to you to sell you a replacement vehicle to, get
to you, for an injury claim. We all know what happens and we think that
is that merry go rounds that needs to be stopped. In a disfunctional
system people need to behave in dysfunctional ways. What can't the
Association of British Insurers say to members do not get involved in
this side of the business? Stop it. We have argued that you have to ban
referral fees and the Government agrees with that. They are going to
do that. We have mentioned the fact young people are getting huge
quotes for their insurance you, have given me a reason why that is.
