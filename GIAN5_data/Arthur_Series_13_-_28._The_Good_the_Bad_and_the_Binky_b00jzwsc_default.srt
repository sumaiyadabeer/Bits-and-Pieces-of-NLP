Everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view
  And I say, hey!
  Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day If you can learn to work and play
And get along with each other
You gotta listen to your heart Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm of the street Open your eyes! Open your ears!
Get together, make things better By working together
It's a simple message And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself For that's the place to start
  And I say, hey!
  Hey!
  What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play And get along with each other
What a wonderful kind of day, hey! What a wonderful kind of day, HEY!
  Hey! DW!
  Hey!
Aargh!
One pepperoni slice, one egg salad sandwich with extra pickles
and a Mount Olympus salad, please.
Look! Yamada Taro holds the world record for pizza eating!
22 slices in 10 minutes! He's my role model.
  What's a role model?
  Someone you look up to and want to be like.
THAT'S who YOU want to be like? He probably got sick to his stomach!
Great achievements require great sacrifices.
Well, my role model is smart, nice and does a lot more than eat pizza!
  And I'm related to him!
  You mean...? Wow! Thanks, DW.
Why are you thanking me? I was talking about Dad.
Calamari?
Huh! Arthur a role model(!) Wait till I tell Emily!
  think Arthur could be a role model for someone. Anyone could.
Hey, you got something on your shirt! ..Made you look!
That's gonna cost you one pepperoni!
BUR RR P! Later!
Well...maybe not anyone.
  Are you here to pay me back for my pizza?
  Er...no.
I'm here to offer you some delicious treats. Only a dollar a piece.
Sugar packets? I can get those free at the Sugar Bowl!
Yeah, but I'm delivering them to you. With a smile.
Wait! Isn't there a chore I can do for you? I really need some money!
  Why?
  The World of Wrestling Spring Smackdown is coming to Elwood City,
  but it costs 50 bucks!
  Sorry. Wish I could help!
  Oh...
  Wait! I heard that Emily's mom was looking for a babysitter
  while her nanny is away.
  Babysitting, huh? I can do that.
I look after my little sister all the time! Thanks!
We'll be next door. Emily's dinner is in the fridge, bedtime at eight.
  Bye.
  OK! Ready to have some fun? What do you want to play first?
It's 6 o'clock. Mary Ellen always gives me dinner at 6.
Then dinner it is!
  Mary Ellen usually folds the napkin into a shape, like a swan.
  Er...
Here! I made a rock instead!
Ta da!
The Binky Barnes' Blue Plate Special!
  How are those noodles?
  OK. But Mary Ellen usually makes pasta al dente!
  Al who?
  Actually, I'm not hungry. Let's go to my room and play!
Now you're talking! Let the games begin!
And then Princess Penny got her paws all muddy in the puddle...
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Would you be so kind as to pour me some tea?
  "Ben nuwit reenee..."
  Bonne nuit, Rene!
It's French for goodnight, Rene. It's my favourite book!
OK. Ahem...
Ban newt Raynay...
Bonne nuit, Rene.
Bon nwee...
Nuit...
  Noowee....
  Nuit!
  Nuit!
I don't think I want a bedtime story tonight. I'm too tired. Good night.
  'And Uncle Slam has the Crushmeister in a headlock!
'But the Meister breaks free and throws Slam into the ropes... '
  I can't sleep. What are you watching?
  Wrestling.
Uncle Slam's gotta win or he won't make it to the Spring Smackdown.
  Get up, Uncle Slam!
  'Uncle Slam is on his feet!
'And he has the Meister by the big toe!'
  Oh! They're hurting each other!
  Huh?
Oh, no. It's all fake. They plan out everything ahead of time.
  It's like a dance.
  Ooh!
  Like Princess Penny's Mice On Ice show?
  Yes! He did it!
Uncle Slam pinned the Crushmeister!
  What happens now?
  Now Uncle Slam takes on Tiny Tornado!
He's small, but tough! When he does his spinning storm strike, watch out!
  Wow!
  I know. Isn't he graceful?
'And it's over, folks! Uncle Slam is victorious once again!'
It's your parents! You're supposed to be in bed!
10? Thanks!
Only 40 more to go!
Binky!
  How's the money raising going, Binky?
  Great!
I'm babysitting Emily tomorrow and that'll put me over the top!
Smackdown, here I come!
I'll just be out back if you need me.
Let's watch wrestling!
'And Uncle Slam is untying himself using his teeth! He wins again!'
  Woo hoo!
  Woo hoo!
I almost forgot! I brought something for you.
It's my old Uncle Slam jacket from when I was little.
  It doesn't fit me any more.
  It's beautiful! Thanks!
To escape from your opponent, you go down on one arm and roll level.
That's it! You're getting the hang of it.
  Oops! Pardon moi!
Is that all you got? You can do better than that! Listen to this.
Woo hoo!
So then Tiny Tornado came at Uncle Slam like this! Hai ya!
  But Uncle Slam got Tiny Tornado in a headlock...
  Hey, Emily!
  Want to play Princess Penny? You can be one of the ice mice.
  Um, not now.
We're playing wrestling. ..Pin him! Like this!
Something is definitely wrong.
All she's interested in is wrestling.
It's like someone traded the nice Emily with a burp y, shove y Emily!
Has she been trailing green slime? Maybe she's become an alien?
I could ask Binky, he's been babysitting her.
He has? Wait! That's it!
Binky's burp y and shove y. She must be getting it from him!
Come on! We have to talk to him!
Wrestling moves? Yeah, I taught her some stuff.
But she's a natural. Look!
That was a lock and spin roll. ..Nice one, Em!
You'd better un teach her!
Why? She's just having fun.
But she's not Emily ish any more! I want my old friend back!
  She's also getting in trouble.
  Emily! You're playing too rough!
  I don't know what's gotten into you! Now, apologise to James.
  Burp!
See? You ARE a bad influence, Binky Barnes!
I am? I didn't mean to be!
'Prisoner B 1 7 6 9, Binky Barnes. Guilty of being a bad influence!'
I know you can't have any room mates
  so I brought you my talking, bionic bunny doll!
  Thanks!
What did you DO to him? You really ARE a bad influence!
Hi, I, um... I was wondering if I could talk to Emily about something?
Sure, come right in.
Emily, you need to stop being like me and just...be yourself.
I am being myself. Let's wrestle!
Emily! You have to be like your other self! The one that likes dolls
  and dainty shoes.
  I do still like those things. See?
  Hey! Is that Princess Patty?
  No! That's Princess Penny!
Right. That's what I meant. So you still like her, huh?
Of course! In fact, we're going to the Mice On Ice show on Saturday!
  Want to come?
  Absolut... Wait. Saturday?
Oh. Well, maybe we could go to that instead!
Body slam!
  Er, come to think of it... I'll give it a shot.
  Yay!
That's the Rat Ogre   Princess Penny's arch enemy!
That jump was amazing! It was like something Tiny Tornado would do!
That was nothing! Wait till you see the Kangaroo King! More popcorn?
Pardon moi!
And everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view
And I say, hey!
What a wonderful kind of day What a wonderful kind of day.
