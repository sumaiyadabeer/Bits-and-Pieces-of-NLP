I ain't got long. Jim's eggs is nearly ready,
and he likes them just so.
I couldn't wait another minute. I haven't had a wink of sleep...
Ah well, a guilty conscience tends to have that effect.
I'm sorry.
I... I don't know what came over me.
Look other people round here, I wouldn't trust 'em as far as I could throw 'em. But you?
I was putting the money back.
I swear on George's life!
I gave my Nick the benefit of the doubt and look where that got me.
  Please, Mrs Branning.
Ah! Close the door on your way out, will ya?
Oi! You can knock a monkey off that for a start. Otherwise
  we'll never get rid of this junk.
  Yeah, but Max says that.
Clue is in the title.
  Jack!
  Oh, you life saver.
  Finders fee.
I want to buy myself a new top.
  Maybe something lacy.
  Really?
  Mmm.
  Maybe I'll knock off early then.
  What about your little empire?
  Yeah, well they'll be all right.
  They can take care of themselves, can't they.
  Thank you. See you later.
  See you later.
You can't stay in here all day.
  Try me.
  Hiding never solved nothing.
Except from the Old Bill, of course.
Alfie's gone, Nan. He's packed his bags. It's over.
He's over the road. It's not too late.
Excuse me. Sorry. We've run out of bleach for the bogs.
Sorry to hear about you and Alfie.
Who else have you blabbed to?
Get out!
Get out the pair of you!
I was only trying to help!
Nice one, motor mouth.
What have I done?
Kat... come on, you're just being stupid!
  Can't you take a hint!
  What about the pub?
  What about it?
Well, who's going to run the bar?
Congratulations. You've just been promoted.
Ron, do we have to do this now? I'm starving.
Well, no wonder you were eating Michael's face off.
Ah. So that's the reason you didn't come home last night.
Roxy, you didn't!
  Yes, I did.
  Michael Moon, eh? Well, I suppose you could do worse.
  Glad you approve.
  I'm sure Christian will love the fact you're sleeping around!
  We were careful. Not that it's any of your business.
  So, come on. Details!
  That is wrong on so many levels.
Roxy, you've only known him for five minutes!
  Don't be such a prude. Women can have one night stands!
  Who says it's a one night stand?
  Is there any hot water left?
  Are you...are you serious? You and Michael?
  I'm going to have a shower.
Oi. Excuse me.
I'll say something for Roxy, she don't take no prisoners, mate.
Oi. That's my sister in law you're talking about.
Like you don't know. The only bloke to have done the double.
  Oi, feet off the desk.
  Morning, smiler.
  What's he doing here?
  Vanessa still giving you the Siberian treatment?
  Yeah. No, thanks to Edward Slither hands here.
  For the record, she kissed me. Have a mint?
  No, thanks.
What you think you're doing, Darren, knocking 500 off the stock?
  I'm just following orders, ain't I?
  Well they're way over list price!
Throw in a discount, and the mugs think it's a bargain.
  The only mug here is you for buying them bangers in the first place.
  Rule one, innit. Know your market.
  Well, you know I'm right though!
  You ain't.
  Yes, I am.
  You ain't.
  Yes, I am.
  You know you ain't.
  My dad's bigger than your dad.
  Is he still here?
Rather you than me.
Do you have to do that in here?
Is all that really necessary?
You know your father. How he likes to keep up appearances.
Yeah.
  What?
  Yusef's probably more of a custard cream man.
What are you doing?
Do you want to wake Kamil?
Sit down, sit.
Nope, not that one. The other one.
Right, can you read it from there?
You've framed our business award?
Yeah, well Yusef's not the only one with certificates.
  What, am I suddenly married to Ian Beale? Can you take it down.
  I'm not having him look down on us.
Why's this all so formal? Can we not just sit in the lounge?
You can show your face, but that's it.
  Why?
  Because I'm doing all the talking.
  Sorry, I thought I was the one going out with Afia.
And I'm the head of this family!
Lease or freehold?
  He'll call you back.
  Do you mind?
This is an emergency.
  Talk to Alfie and make him see sense.
  What are you going on about?
  He's only gone and left her.
Packed his bags. God knows why!
Alfie hasn't told you, has he?
No. But maybe that's cos it's none of my business, Mo.
  Alfie'd drop everything to get you out of a hole.
  I'm not Alfie, am I?
  No, you ain't! He's got a heart.
  Here, is Kat all right?
  Not really.
She's locked herself in the bedroom.
What? Right, stand back.
  Let the dog see the rabbit.
  Where you going?
Look, when Dexter did the dirty on me, do you know what got me through it?
  Yeah, three bottles of rum, as I remember rightly.
  Friends.
Time to weave a little Kimmy's magic. Come on Mo.
Well, have you thought this through, huh?
Inviting him here. Into our house.
Tam didn't give me much choice.
Now he's going to find out we told Yusef in the first place that they had to stop seeing each other.
  Yusef won't say anything.
  Yeah, you HOPE he won't.
Afia disobeyed him. Yusef will hit the roof and we'll end up being the good guys.
  Red or blue?
  Blue.
  Red.
  Red.
  Blue.
  Move.
  Hiya.
  Oh, sorry, I was looking for Michael.
No, no. He's not about, sorry.
You had a heavy night?
Uh...yeah, just a bit.
Just catching up on my beauty sleep.
  I thought you'd be at the Vic with Kat.
  Oh, change as good as a rest.
We're on top of each other 24/7 at the moment.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, it's good, darling.
Couldn't be better.
I'm not stupid, Alfie. What's wrong?
  It's just a slight hiccup.
  But it'll be fine.
  What sort of hiccup?
Just a temporary suspension in relations, that's all.
You've split up?
Afia! Get in.
  What are you doing here?
  I couldn't not call in!
If Dad says no, we'll never see each other again.
I'll leave you to it.
What you going to do? Blind him into submission?
  Too much?
  Take it off.
Least he can't lynch you with it.
You're really building my confidence here(!)
He can't see me! He'll go mental!
Get upstairs. Go. Go!
  Get the door, Tamwar.
  Yeah, OK!
Uncle Ji.
Nice touch.
  Very Michael Buble.
  Salam Alaikum.
  We weren't expecting you till half past.
  Walaikum Salam.
The M25 was dead so I put my foot down. Blame Jimmy Paige.
  You're a Led Zeppelin fan?
  I know. Caught the bug at med school.
  You caught the bug at med school. Who'd've thought?
  We all have our secrets, Masood.
You're the strongest couple I know. If you split up, what chance is there for the rest of us?
  We're not exactly Posh and Becks!
  Mind, you'd think so looking at Kat's wardrobe bill.
  What happened?
Nothing! Listen, Ronnie, things haven't been the same since,
  you know...
  But you can't just give up!
That's not my call to make.
Is there someone else?
  Alfie, who?
  It was just a kiss. Wasn't exactly Gone With The Wind.
No, listen, you must have got it wrong! HE SIGHS
  Who?
  Michael. It was nothing, Ronnie.
  Kat was drunk and it just happened, all right?
  He let it happen.
  Please, keep it under your hat. Damage limitation.
  Yeah, course.
  Sorry, I got to get this.
Hello?
  Here! I ain't leaving till you unlock this door!
  I said go away!
  Get your glad rags on! We're going out on the pull!
  You what?
  The quickest way to win back your man is to make him jealous. Fact.
  Where is Dexter these days?
Six feet under, with any luck.
Here! Listen!
  I'm gonna huff, I'm gonna puff.
  I think the word you're looking for is maestro, yeah.
THEY SCREAM That clear enough for ya?
Sorry about this.
Oh, Heather, come on, I haven't got all day!
  I think I better leave the cheese sandwich, sorry.
  Leave it alone. You'll do your head in, staring at it all day.
  No, bit late for that.
You need to give it a couple of days. Go away for a bit. Clear your head.
  I can't leave her on her own.
  Hey, budge up!
  Do you mind?
This is private, actually.
Well, pardon me for breathing.
  Oh, no, Michael, I'm not sure. I don't think I can do it.
  Look, Kat clicks her fingers, you go running!
Yeah, because I love her. I happen to love her to bits.
I know you do, yeah. But you've got to make her realise how much she loves you. Come on!
Oi, why should I have to do that? That's Darren's job.
No, Darren's collecting a motor.
I don't see you with a chamois in your hand?
Give it a rest will ya. You ain't king of the castle no more.
  What does that mean?
  You sold the club! I didn't have to sell you half my business!
  So, that's what it's like? You did this to lord it over me.
  Me and Darren are grafters.
We ain't got no room for passengers.
  You did that on purpose!
  Oh, give it a rest.
  I could kill you sometimes!
  Yeah? Not if I kill you first.
So when will she be back?
No idea. Her phone's been driving me mad though, beeping like crazy. Do you fancy a glass of wine?
  No, thanks.
  Oh, come on! Days off are supposed to be fun.
Yeah go on then. Fine, Whatever.
Well, there's an open bottle in the fridge. I'm just popping to the loo.
  You have one message.
'Roxy. Sorry about earlier. It's Michael, by the way.
'I'm having a bad day, but I've a feeling it's about to get better
'when you say yes, to lunch at the Vic. About half one? See you there.'
Urgh! No loo paper! God knows what Roxy does with it!
  What are you doing?
  Nothing, it just rang.
  Some double glazing firm offering the deal of a lifetime.
  Oh, those people.
  Natural born liars, all of them.
  Yep. Roxy.
  No.
  I'm not in the mood, Ronnie.
  No, listen to me. I'm sorry. I will take you out to lunch.
  My treat.
  Actually, we've got some important things to discuss.
Like what?
Rent, bills. Money matters.
  Can't that wait?
  Yes! That can wait.
Come on, and then you can spend some quality time, you and James.
You never leave him with anyone.
Yeah, well there's a first time for everything, isn't there?
All right, fine. Not like I'm swamped with offers, am I?
Good, good, good. I'll go and get James's things.
  What are you playing at?
  Phil's a slippery fish.
  It might be very helpful to have Ronnie on board.
  No! No way.
This is my money and we will get it back my way. Do you understand? Keep your mouth shut!
Right that's £4.70. No, it's not £4.75, it's £4.85. Hang on a sec... Sorry, darling.
  Oh, look, can we just call it a fiver.
  Yeah!
Uh, cottage pie and a ploughman's? There's no numbers on the order.
Yeah, well you've got a pair of lungs, haven't you?
  No Alfie then today?
  No, no Alfie full stop, love.
I haven't heard anything so stupid in all me life!
I don't hear you coming up with any great ideas.
  Well, what we going to do? Kat can't stay in there forever!
  Oooh.
Ah! If at first you don't succeed...play dirty.
  Now what you up to?
  Reinforcements.
  This isn't working. I'm drowning here.
  Well, I can't help! I'm a slave to me farmers!
I'll give you a hand, if you like.
  Hang about. It's your day off!
  Every penny counts.
  We'll never afford the wedding otherwise.
  What experience you got?
  What experience does she need?
  It's pouring drinks.
  Darren!
Nothing really. But I'm easy on the eye and I've watched Cocktail, like, a thousand times.
There's an hour of my life I'm never going to get back.
  What?
  You haven't said a word since we've been here.
Look. There's no easy way to say this.
But Michael is bad news.
  Why do you always do that?
  Do what?
  You always have to see the worst in everyone, don't you?
  Listen to me.
  What?
  Listen to me, sit down.
You are my little sister, all right?
I really do not want you getting hurt.
If you don't stop trying to ruin my life, you and me are going to
  seriously fall out, OK.
  Why do you think Kat split up with Alfie?
  Since when?
  Yeah, that's right.
Who do you think Alfie caught coming on to Kat?
Go on, Roxy, take one guess.
You decided what you want yet?
  Hey?
  You decided what you want yet?
  No, I've changed my mind, thanks.
I think you should stick to health and beauty.
  Sorry. Third time lucky.
  You on your todd?
Yeah, well, Dumb and Dumber are doing my head in.
I need some time out. You?
  I dunno, just loose end. Knocking about.
  Hmm.
  I want to show you something.
  Oi, I just got a pint in.
Come on, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Ta da.
So what's the deal?
I take it you didn't invite me over to sample Zainab's delights.
Tamwar asked me to call you.
He still has feelings for Afia.
They're still seeing each other.
  And you let them?
  They're not kids any more.
Tamwar runs his own business. He's his own man.
Maybe he should face me as one.
Tamwar!
How long has this been going on?
Uh...
A few weeks. Give or take.
I'll need my coat.
I know we went against your wishes and I'm sor...well, I'm not sorry.
  I'm glad we did.
  My wishes.
  That's not strictly true...
  The whys and wherefores aren't important. What matters is now.
  My coat.
Afia's not to blame. Neither of us are. All we did was fall in love.
My coat.
  Who are you calling?
  Afia.
Dad! Fancy seeing you here.
  Do you love him?
  Almost as much as you.
Your mother would have been over the moon.
  You know how much she loved a wedding.
  Wedding?
If your parents are OK with it.
Afia would be welcomed into our family with open arms.
Congratulations. I just hope you know what you're letting yourself in for.
  A boxing club?
  Yeah. We'd make a killing.
Yeah? And what do you know about boxing?
I mean, you couldn't swing a hand bag around.
You do though. They didn't call your old man Basher Branning for nothing.
  I need a nine to five.
I've got family now. It's a lifestyle thing.
Selling clapped out motors to tyre kickers. It's not a lifestyle, Jack. It's a prison sentence.
No, place like this doesn't just bring you in the money.
Earns you something far more bankable.
Oh, yeah, what's that?
Respect.
Well, don't think Ronnie'll like it.
  Ronnie again.
  Well, we're married, all right.
  We're partners, it's equal. That's how it goes.
  What about what you want though? Don't that count?
Listen, good luck with it, yeah?
I'm sure Fargos won't mind Kamil tucked up asleep in the corner.
Kamil gets very grouchy when he wakes up. So please, you go.
Without the mother of the groom? Wouldn't feel right.
Another time. We'll be seeing a lot more of each other after all.
Darren! Hey, Darren! I'll leave to do the honours, shall I?
Love's young dream, eh?
Over my dead body.
  Marriage!
  There's no way I'm having that man as part of our family.
We need to put a stop to it.
It's too late now.
We'll see about that.
If we go back on our word, we'll lose our son.
And I can't risk that.
I won't.
Oi! What do you think you're doing?
We've run out of pound coins. It's all there.
  You're the cleaner, not a barmaid.
  Yeah, well, Mo promoted me.
And I won't be doing it again.
Your punters are so rude. Mind you, so's the landlady.
  Whatever.
  They're all running round downstairs for you, do you know that?
  Get out of my way.
And I've told 'em all, if there's one lesson I've learnt, nobody can solve your problems, but you.
  Um, I'm afraid Jack's at work.
  No, it's Ronnie I want, actually.
  Is she about?
  Well, that'll have to wait.
  She's out for lunch with Roxy.
  Poisoning her mind too, I bet.
  What are you talking about?
  I left Roxy a voice mail.
Inviting her to lunch, yeah? Nothing. Total radio silence.
Well, maybe her mobile's out of juice.
Yeah. Oh, right. BABY CRIES
Well, obviously the baby doesn't like the sound of your voice.
And, I think that makes two of us. I think you'd better go.
What's the matter?
It's all right, it's all right.
You still here?
  He's got lovely eyes, hasn't he? Just like his grandma.
  Oh, don't.
  That makes me sound so old.
  There's no guessing where Roxy gets her looks from.
Flattery will get you everywhere.
If I knew what I'd done wrong I could put it right, couldn't I?
But, take yesterday... Ronnie, she couldn't wait to get rid of me.
  It's not exactly the biggest flat in the world.
  No, it wasn't that. She didn't want me anywhere near her.
Like I was the Antichrist or something.
Jack's my oldest mate. Anyone who can make that miserable git smile gets my vote.
  I'm sure it's not personal.
  What is it then?
  Jack, can I borrow the calculator?
  Yeah, go on, help yourself.
  Cheers, mate.
  Aw, Darren!
  Oh, sorry. Hang on.
Here's a sponge, I'll just clear it up.
Dal, just leave it alone, will ya?
I'll do it! Give us it!
Hey, another satisfied customer!
Took our finance package. Even took a valet kit.
  No way? Kerching!
  Who the man?
Max, you're the man. Yay! Come on, woo! THEY LAUGH
  I'm sorry I'm late, I'm not feeling very well...
  You know, Heather,
this happens one more time, I'll have to inform Mr Ola pola pus.
Oh, dear. I'll pop the kettle on, shall I?
This is your last warning!
Right. After three.
  Are we seriously doing this?
  On your marks!
  I thought you said after three.
  She can't count that far.
  Are you helping me or not?
  And who's paying when we take it off its hinges?
Fine, I'll do it myself. Stand back.
Ta raaaaarrrrgh!
  Agh! Urgh!
  Where is she?
  All set then?
  Oh, Michael, I'm not sure about this.
  Oi, you'll feel better. Trust me.
  Is that your aftershave?
  What?
  THEY LAUGH What's the matter with you?
  Is that how you pull the birds?
  Get them close to you, then they pass out.
  They love it, mate. Come on, let's get a shift on.
Rush hour. Eh! Come on.
  Come on! Get in the car!
  All right, all right. Wind your window down, that stinks, that!
What about sundries? You know, bits and pieces.
It's no use, Mrs Branning.
Nonsense. All you need's a bit of help with your financial planning.
My generation was brought up on rationing.
Yeah, but all my wages it goes on childcare. Then there's the rent, the electricity.
  This came the other day.
  What's that then?
  Council tax.
  How much?
How did you let it get so out of hand?
Well, the landlord said it was included in the rent,
but now he's saying it's not in the tenancy agreement...
  Well, didn't you read it?
  No. He seemed like a nice guy.
Well, drink up. They can do without us this afternoon.
  Why, where are we going?
  Citizen's advice bureau.
Seek and ye shall find.
Where you been? We've been worried sick!
  Where do you think?
  That's my girl. What's he say?
Not much. He was too busy chucking his bag in the car.
What, he's gone? Gone where?
Who cares. I doubt if I'll be getting a postcard.
  How was lunch?
  Yeah, it was eventful. How was James?
You had a visitor.
Michael Moon.
  What did he want?
  To sell me double glazing.
Look, I'm just...I'm trying to protect Roxy from making the biggest mistake of her life.
This is not about Roxy. This is about you. You and him.
What are you talking about? There is no me and him!
  Then why are you behaving like this?
  Because I happen to think he's a creep, all right?
  Who's a creep?
  No one.
  We were just talking about Michael.
  Why, what's he done?
Nothing. And it doesn't really matter does it? Anyway. He's leaving.
  I saw him packing his boot.
  Yeah, for the weekend.
What?
Well, he's coming back on Monday. Well, he better do.
  I don't wanna be lumbered with the planning permission.
  What are you talking about?
Me and Michael.
We're opening up a boxing club.
  Right, who's vodka tonic?
  Yeah, that's me, thanks.
  Right. Here's to the first day of the rest of my life.
  If you fall off your horse,
  choose another stallion.
  Oh, just don't listen to her. She don't know what she's talking about.
The main thing is, never look back and wonder if.
  I don't regret anything. Not a single thing.
  Not even those trousers with that top?
You sure this is vodka tonic? Taste that, Tan.
  That's lemonade.
  Oh, sorry! I'll get you another one. I'll bring it over.
  I better get round there before she puts me out of business.
  You sure?
  Come on, we'll make a barmaid of you yet.
  Seriously?
  Yeah.
  You're offering me a job?
  Yeah. But do me a favour.
Next time don't wear a skirt shorter than mine.
  I don't like competition. Yes, love, what can I get you?
  Pint, please.
Well, I'll have Ronnie's glass if she doesn't want it.
You're damn right. I don't want anything to do with it. Nor should you.
  It's a good business opportunity.
  It's money out of violence. He's a bad influence.
  I'll go.
How many friends have I got round here? Real friends.
We don't need friends like that! He's not like us.
  You're a stuck up cow, sometimes.
  Can you see? He is already turning you against me!
  Oi! What's all the shouting about? I can hear you in the hallway.
  He wants his mummy.
Here we go, sweetie.
  You're shaking!
  No, I'm not.
Ronnie. Look at me. Look at me.
I know you. You're hiding something, aren't you?
Come on, Ron, talk to us. Come on!
It wasn't my fault, all right?
I tried to stop it. I really tried.
Tried what? Ron?
Michael.
Michael, he came on to me.
