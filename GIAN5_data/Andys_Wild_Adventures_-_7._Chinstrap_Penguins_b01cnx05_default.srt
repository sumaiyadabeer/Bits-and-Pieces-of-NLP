Andy and Kip on another wild adventure
Hey, join the crew!
Off to see the animals to find out what they do
Yeah, you can come, too!
It's Andy's wild adventures
Round the world!
Hi, I'm Andy and I work here at Pickles' Animal Park,
It's my job to look after the animals.
I'm feeding the chipmunks so they've got enough food.
That's it, Alvin. Eat up!
Hey, take a look at them!
They're old socks and the chipmunks use them to make nests. Cool, huh?
  That sock there's mine.
  Smelly sock!
  Oof!
'Are you there, Andy? Over.'
It's Mr Pickles. All right, boss?
Hello, Mr Pickles. Andy receiving loud and clear. Over.
'Hello, Andy. A bowerbird is making a nest
'but can't find enough feathers.
'Could you see if there are any lying around? Over.
OK, no problem.
I'll visit the birds now and see what I can find. Over.
'Good lad! Pickles out.'
Right, let's go.
See you later!
Now, is everything OK, guys?
These lorikeets in the wild nest in large hollow tress.
But in the park, we've put up some boxes for them to nest in.
OK, guys, fancy a drink?
Oh, before I give you a drink, do you have any spare feathers?
No, Andy, we haven't.
Oh, that's a shame.
I'll have a think about it on my tea break.
Right, here we go.
Hello, Kip.
Oh, hello, Andy.
Wow! What are these?
Oh, just my latest brilliant invention.
My completely cool climbing claws.
Wow! What do they do?
Well, when I want to climb up somewhere really high,
all I need to do is put these on and   tadaaa!   away I go!
Amazing, Kip! What a great idea.
Do you know what? You're a true cat genius, you are.
Oh, thanks, Andy. Ha ha ha!
So what have you been doing?
I've seen the chipmunks nesting in their socks again,
and the lorikeets have laid lots of eggs in their nest boxes.
But I thought birds laid their eggs in nests, in trees.
No, not all of them. Look, I'll show you on the laptop. Here we go.
Ah! You see, flamingos lay their eggs on mounds of mud,
kingfishers lay theirs in holes in a riverbank,
and puffins lay theirs underground.
But one bird lays its eggs somewhere
so far off they can barely get there themselves.
Really? What bird's that?
A chinstrap penguin.
It lives in a place called Antarctica but the amazing thing is,
it lays its eggs on a cliff top so high up and difficult to climb,
that even feeding its chicks is a real adventure.
Oh. Well, why can't it just fly to the top of the cliff?
Because penguins can't fly.
They have to walk all the way up.
Wow! Maybe they could use my completely cool climbing claws.
Or I could!
Ah! You know what this sounds like, right?
I certainly do!
Time to go on a wild adventure!
We'll see the penguins climb the cliff to feed their young ones.
You can test my climbing claws!
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's do it!
One, gadget pack.
Check!
Two, gizmo.
  Check!
  Three,
completely cool climbing claws. Ha ha!
Just in case we need them. Yeah!
Check!
And, last but not least, the Kipmobile!
Seatbelts on.
Hit it, Kip.
Lift off!
Woo hoo hoo! We're in space!
So, where to, Andy?
That big patch of white down there is Antarctica.
We're off to an island nearby   Deception Island.
Deception Island, here we come.
Go, cat nav, gooooo!
Woah, ho, ho, ho, ho, hohhh!
Are we nearly there yet, kip?
Not far now.
Look, chinstrap penguins!
Wow! There's hundreds of them.
And it looks like they're just back from a fishing trip at sea.
Oh, woah, they must be freezing!
Actually, they're probably quite cosy, as a thick layer of fat
keeps them warm and their feathers are waterproof.
Right. OK, Kip, let's find somewhere to land.
Woah oah! Woah ho ho!
So, where are these nests, then?
On that island over there, right on top of that old volcano.
Volcano? So how exactly do we, er, YOU, plan to get there?
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to swim there!
Size of a chinstrap penguin.
Activate rocket pack!
Underwater mode!
Kip, are you OK to stay here and look after the Kipmobile,
in case the ice breaks up?
OK. I guess someone has to. Ha ha!
Perfect! Well done, Kip! Now it's time for a dip!
This...
..is...
..great!
Yeearrrgh!
These have just caught some fish, swallowed it, and are
taking it up the cliff to feed their chicks.
I'll follow them to find out how they do it. This way!
There are not just a few penguins making the journey,
there are thousands of them,
all trying to make their way up that slippery slope behind me.
The problem is, the cliff face is so muddy and slippery,
that it makes it really difficult to climb up.
Luckily, they've got very sharp claws to grip the ground with.
Otherwise, it's just their beaks or their wings.
Are you all right there, buddy?
That's it. Don't give up. Keep on going!
This mum knows what she's doing. I'll follow her.
  Andy, are you there?
  I sure am. How are you doing?
All right but, er, I seem to have a visitor.
Here, look!
Oh, don't worry about him.
He's just a seal.
Er, and a hungry looking seal!
Yes, but he eats krill which are like tiny little shrimps.
Not cats!
Phew! Ha ha ha ha!
Right, I'll see you later, Kip.
Right, OK, now to tackle this.
Er, do you mind if I...?
Now, if I put my hand here and my foot here...
Woahhh!
Oh, no! I'm never going to be able to do this.
Hang on.
Of course! Kip's completely cool climbing claws.
Ha ha! Here we go.
Woahhh!
Hang on, wait for me! I'm almost there.
Oh, I've made it! These birds are so tough.
She's still got to find her family.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I might be small, but I'm no shrimp, OK? I'm a cat.
Hmph!
C A T. Cat!
Hmph!
I can't believe she's travelled from the sea... Whoa! Whoops!
..all the way here.
She now has to find her own family amongst all these thousands
and thousands of birds, but luckily she has the most amazing hearing,
even with all the others calling at the same time.
Oh, look! She's made it!
Aw! And her and the dad are really happy.
Look at them wagging their heads. They're like little lovebirds.
Aw! And there's the chick.
Now we know why mum's climbed all this way,
to feed her chick with the fish she kept in her tummy.
I've swum and climbed with them,
a mouthful of food,
and now it's dad's turn to do it all over again.
I'm so tired and I've only done it once!
Kip, you couldn't come and pick me up, could you?
Ah ha! There!
Oh, well done, Kip. I knew I could count on you.
Andy, upload!
See you later, penguins.
Oop! Ah, thanks, Kip. Good timing!
'Andy? Are you there, Andy? Over.'
Uh oh! It's Mr Pickles, the boss!
Er, hello, Mr Pickles. Andy here, receiving loud and clear. Over.
'Where have you been, Andy? Over.'
Erm, I've just been, er...
I've just been collecting feathers for the bowerbird's nest. Over.
'Oh, smashing, Andy! Just what we need, Pickles out.'
Right, back to work for me. I'll see you next time.
