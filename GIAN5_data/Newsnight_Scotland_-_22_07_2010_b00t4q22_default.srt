Megrahi in the autumn of last year. There was also a letter yesterday
evening sent to the centres from the first minister Alex Salmond in
which he makes it clear on their primary concern, he flatly denies
that al Megrahi was released because of a oil deal. He says the
only reason he was sent home is because he was dying of cancer.
do the senators want to see? list is growing and it has been
over the last few hours. They wanted to speak to Kenny MacAskill,
Dr Andrew Fraser who is the chief medical adviser to the Scottish
Prison Service. They also want to speak to Tony Blair, the former
the former UK Justice Secretary. Tony Hayward, who has become famous
because of the BP oil spill, the company's chief executive. Sir Mark
Alan, one of their senior advisers. All of these have been invited. We
are aware of none of them accepting invitations to give evidence.
Jack Straw given any indication as to whether he might go? He has gone
the furthest in explaining his thinking, in saying in principle he
has no objection to helping with the inquiry but he wants, as a
matter of protocol, to first of all check with Gordon Brown who used to
be his boss, to see if it is OK. And then to check with the Foreign
Office and officials before he gives evidence to what is, at the
end of the day, a foreign parliament which is demanding
officials from a separate foreign sovereign state. What are the
senators hoping to achieve? They are hoping to get to the trees of
why Abdelbaset al Megrahi was released.    the trees. There is
enormous amount of anger    the truth. Some of the senators had
members of family killed in the bombing and the angry that, guy he
was released and they were told he would die within three months, and
he is still alive almost a year on. I have spoken to a representative
of some of the American families and asked them about the Scottish
Government's rejection of travelling to Washington. A senator
said, I wouldn't show up if I was either of those two. He said it
would be helpful if Kenny MacAskill had gone to America and admitted
that releasing al Megrahi was a mistake. He says the fact he hasn't
done that makes it look as if it wasn't an honest mistake. There
will be completely rejected by the Scottish Government who say the
only reason he was released is because he was dying, and that was
done following due process. Have we had any official reaction from the
eyes? Official reaction from the US senators who have demanded the
inquiry, we are waiting for that. In terms of the relationship
between the UK and the US and how they can call witnesses, we have
heard in the last hour or so from a spokesman for the US State
Department. We're not in a position to compel
Scottish or British authorities to I would not say that it necessarily
means British and Scottish authorities are not co operating.
They are going through their own processes as Prime Minister Cameron
said they would. In rejecting this invitation, the story doesn't go
away. Opposition politicians have been commenting. They have.
Scottish Labour say Kenny MacAskill should have gone to Washington and
explain his thinking to the senators. They also say he should
have met with the families of the victims. Labour say he should have
apologised for releasing Abdelbaset al Megrahi. The Scottish
Conservatives also say he should have given evidence to that inquiry
and say the fact he didn't makes this decision look suspicious.
Thanks very much indeed. Now, would you rather have a new
school in your neighbourhood or a new road to it? Choices like that
are confronting Scottish ministers, as the UK's budget for capital
projects is cut in half. A new academic report says Scotland is
facing a "capital hiatus" in the next five years if the right
decisions are not made now. But how do you choose between a new bridge
and a new hospital? The academics believe the process of choice must
be more precise and transparent. We'll debate the options in a
When money is tight, you wouldn't buy a new house, would you? As the
household budget titans, it is the big ticket items that we let go
first. But is that how to run an economy. The government faces
intense pressure on the money it uses to pay for capital works. New
roads and upgrades, public buildings and the like. When a huge
bill is pending for tens of millions, how tempting is it to
write it off? You have to think through, what would you before
going if you cut that project all that investment?    what we GB
foregoing? You might want to be replacing capital struck which is
crumbling which will cost a lot more in the future. You might want
to open up economic opportunities for the future. It is important
that we think through why you might want to cut capital investment.
Seductive though it may be to cut short term cash flow, you have to
think of the longer term impact on the economy. Capital spending will
halve in Britain over the next five years. In Scotland, that will mean
a cut of £1.6 billion. If the SNP were to ring fence health, the cuts
would reach 60%. The big four spending areas are local government,
transport, health and housing. We confront the issues raised every
day. This is the M8. Only it isn't, it is the A eight. This section
never was upgraded to motorway status. It begs the question, if we
can't connect the two major centres of economic activity with a proper
motorway, will we be ready for recovery when it comes? The list of
projects lengthens as time goes on. The new Forth crossing, the
Aberdeen bypass, the Waverley line, and 74 extension, at the
Commonwealth Games and schools and hospitals and roads across the
country    the end 74 extension. This huge primary school is well
under way and it epitomises the problem. Do you invest now and
possibly improve the economy, or do you wait longer term and make more
expensive returns    repairs? Capital projects mean notional
employment until work begins. They are not today's P45 jobs. That is
the major dilemma that will be faced by politicians. They are
facing certainty of job cuts to save cash and uncertainty of
benefits to come through if you spend that money on infrastructure
projects. There lies the dilemma, not just for the government but all
politicians in the Scottish Parliament. What criteria are
applied in deciding what to chop and keep? There isn't an up to date
list of projects. Audit Scotland estimates the current total as 104,
worth £4.7 billion. Does it need to be clearer? Most capital projects
will undergo some sort of investment appraisal process. They
may be dated, they may use different assumptions. Again, given
the timescale it takes for a lot of these projects to come to fruition,
it might be time to say, can we start to reappraise them by looking
at them all under the same set of assumptions? The government says it
is already scrutinising effectively. Into the next come political
conundrums. The academics say the door must be opened to the
possibility of private money being shoehorned in through public 
private initiatives and in outside equity to Scottish water. It seems
You can in fact finance it through long term bond market financing,
which may be just as attractive as the public sector grants or funding.
SNP ministers are already receiving similar advice from the Scottish
features trust, feeding into the independent budget review.
I'm joined now by Jo Armstrong of the CPPR, who you saw in the film
there. Scotsman columnist and former SNP candidate George Kerevan
is in Edinburgh. And also here in Glasgow is Labour MSP Wendy
Alexander, who's calling for Government action on the long 
promised upgrading of the missing portion of the M8 motorway.
Good evening. Wendy Alexander, can governments north and south of the
border spend their way out of recession? I think we are cutting
too far and too fast. The issue we were highlighting today is a home 
grown problem. The last 10 kilometres of the M8, it now turns
out, are going to be 10 years in the coming. We are seeing the
report for ministers was delivered after the public inquiry 20 months
ago. How vital is this when money is tight? Of course it is vital. It
is the last missing link between Glasgow and Edinburgh. It is vital
to grow the Scottish economy. Bankruptcies in Scotland, corporate
bankruptcies, the worse they have been for almost a decade.
Unemployment may be worse than the rest of the UK. Teetering on the
brink of stagnant growth. Given that, to be allowing the report to
build the last 10 kilometres of the M8, to sit in ministers' desks for
20 months with no decision, that is no way to manage capital projects.
There is a problem here. London talk about austerity, they want to
make cuts. Edinburgh talks about spending are way out of the
recession. How do you square that circle? Wendy didn't say what she
would take the money away from. will come back to that. Of course
we need infrastructure of spending. All the economic studies showed you
get a bigger bang for your bank    your buck if you do that. The
Scottish Government doesn't have control over spending. It is not
allowed to borrow. The money comes from the Treasury. The Treasury
tells the Scottish Government how much capital spending it has. A
Labour government, when these friends down south, cut capital
spending by a half    when the's friends down south. If you don't
have the money, how can you spend it? This is about tough choices,
It is about tough choices, and you have to rank projects and publicly
publish the cost to benefit ratios that allowed projects to be ranked.
If you look at Central Belt transport projects, over the last
three years, where we have had more money than ever before etc, what
has happened? We have seen projects axed and no funding procurement at
all for the Forth Road Bridge. are still waiting for the bypass in
Aberdeen as well. Given that you have these competing demands, the
Government has refused to publish the cost benefit ratios, because
they want to make political decisions. The Scottish economy
cannot afford politics getting in the way of the evidence. I will
come back to that, but Jo Armstrong, you talk about making sure capital
spending is not cut to one in appropriate degree. What level is
inappropriate? It is difficult to give a specific number, but there
is a vast number of projects that we expect to be developed over the
next five to ten years. The capital value of those projects is in
excess of the money we have count he got, let alone what we could end
up having. So it is a best option available for maintaining what we
have got? More importantly, how can we maximise the value of what we
are getting by making sure what we delivery is as efficient as
possible? And are we delivering the right projects? How do we decide
what the right projects are? Cost  benefit analysis is useful in allow
you to compare a road with a hospital with a prison, for example.
At least you have got a benchmark to compare and rank those projects.
Then you simply pick off those projects up to the point where you
run out of money. George, the famous phrase in the US is pork 
barrel politics, politicians choosing projects which best
benefit the areas they represent. That happens here too, doesn't it?
I would not go so far as saying pork barrel politics, but there
will always be a political choice. You need hospitals, prisons and
schools. It is easy to say you would get more of a return from one,
but you have to do everything. We need to get the Scottish government
in Holyrood more borrowing powers. I hope Wendy would support the
recommendations as much as the Northern Ireland government has.
There are things we can do one decide. No one wants to privatise
Scottish water, but it could demutualised. 5% of the ring fenced
capital spend of the Scottish government comes from Scottish
water. If we reach lies did, that would bring more money to put into
schools and other infrastructure. There are things that could be done.
Wendy Alexander, on the subject of politicians making decisions that
suit them, it has been ever thus, hasn't it? I don't think it has.
There has to be a judgment, but when the evidence is published, if
you take the issue of major transport projects in Scotland, the
Government is currently refusing to publish updated cost benefit
analysis for the myriad of real projects we could pursue in
Scotland. But in local area is, people will always say there
project has more urgency than one at the other end of the country.
Which is why it is a scandal that the Government will not publish a
cost benefit analysis for the major real project in Scotland that
allows an informed debate in Parliament. It is also unacceptable
that the Government wants to keep a secret what its plans are until the
third week of November. The way forward is to encourage more
borrowing powers, I do not doubt that. We should go back to her
Majesty's Treasury and say, is the offer made by the Treasury under
Labour for £1 billion towards its the fourth road bridge still on the
table? But critically, here in Scotland, to allow the parliament
to have a say, we need to have the Government published the cost 
benefit analysis. Otherwise there will always be charges of pork 
barrel politics. We need the evidence. Then let the country
debate. What will the impact of this be on the private sector, Joe?
The private sector may get nothing, but the downside of not doing these
investments is that although you have less construction, you also
have less protection of impediments to growth and fewer opportunities
for new economic growth. There are three elements that could be
affected by not undertaking public sector investment. And on the call
for greater transparency, are all governments as guilty of not being
as transparent as they could be? Absolutely. Cost benefit is one
aspect of it, but it is also about annual cash flow. How much cash do
we have every year to spend on infrastructure? It is difficult at
the moment, even for someone who looks at the data closely, it is
difficult to know how much we have to spend next year and whether the
projects we are currently investing in our being sufficiently funded
and whether there are cost overruns and whether we need to allocate
next year's money to this year's projects. George, do you think that
we can ultimately get more for less money in coming years, or is that
unrealistic? That is already happening. The Scottish features
Trust is try to centralise spending. They think they will save £66
billion this year. Can I say, much of when the's debate is a red
Osborne. You do agree on the issue of borrowing powers at least?
there is a case for borrowing powers, but the real issue is that
the Scottish features trust that George's lauding has not built a
single school, hospital, road or public building of any kind in the
three years it has been in existence. It is true. The school
building programme has £1.2 billion. They said they would abolish PPP
and put in place an alternative, and there is no alternative out
there in the marketplace which is making the situation in Scotland
worse than it needs to be. Why is it that for 20 months, Stewart
Stevenson has sat on a report on the motorway? The Scottish future
trust is in charge of a one. And £5 billion expenditure on schools at
the moment. And on PPP, do you know what the cost is on that in
interest rates? We cannot go on paying the that. Thank you or for
joining us. A quick look at the front pages
