Good evening and welcome to BBC Look North. The headlines this
Monday night: Local councils learn how much they
have got to save after the government cut their budgets.
I'll be talking live to the leaders of Hull City Council and East
Lindsey District Council in Lincolnshire, to find out how they
will meet the government targets and still provide services.
An inquest hears how a parachutist was killed during his first display
jump. The unusual places that are going
to become veg patches in Boston in a bid to tackle obesity.
And the Viking visitors that are Another cold plunge later this week.
Join me for the details in 15 Good evening.
Millions of pounds have been cut from council budgets across the
country today. And some of the worst affected are our local
authorities. The biggest cuts are nearly 9% and officials are working
now on how that leaves their spending plans. It's feared
thousands of jobs will have to go and many local services could be
stopped altogether. Our Correspondent Paul Murphy has this
report. Care for the vulnerable, housing,
rubbish collections, these are the frontline services councils will
now be trying to protect and the Government says, in order to save
money, local authorities should look at reducing their workforce.
We don't think it is sensible to have separate legal departments,
accountants, planners, separate education authorities, separate
information technology. Local councils had been planning for
these cuts since the spending review began three months ago.
Before today, many local authorities are roughly estimated
what they would need to save and here are some of those numbers.
Hull City Council said they would need to save between 40 and £50
million in the next year. East Riding said £30 million over three
years. North east Lincolnshire estimated a similar saving over
four years. North Lincolnshire said it was looking at £20 million over
the next four years. For Lincolnshire County Council, that
could be a whopping £80 million per year for three years. Now, despite
these, eye watering figures, it is still not clear what it will mean
for jobs. The in no doubt, these will hit or frontline services and
caused massive job losses in the public and private sector. For all
they're traipsing around the TV studios pretending savings of this
magnitude made by efficiency drives, the reality is very different.
council finance managers will be crunching the numbers through the
night. The devil could emerge from the detail tomorrow.
Joining me now to look at these budget settlements are Carl Minns,
the Liberal Democrat leader of Hull City Council. And from Louth is the
Conservative leader of East Lindsey District Council, Doreen Stephenson.
You are being hit as hard as anywhere else in the country. Do
you think you're getting a fair deal? It could have been worse.
Today, the government put a cap on how much people have to save, and
if it was not there, it would have been worse. £28 million. Huge
figures, aren't they? Where have you got that figure from? We are
still working out the numbers. can be 28 million. I think it's
going to be difficult. We have got to the tax frontline services but I
have said on the show before, I can't guarantee no frontline
service will be affected. Stevenson, and 9% budget cut is
what the government says you would have to cope with but you say it's
actually more than that, don't you? Yes, that's right, Peter. We have
done some work on the numbers being presented this afternoon and it
looks as if, in East Lindsey, it will be more like 12% in the first
year and 10% in the second year. This work is going on now but the
devil is always in the detail and, of course, we won't know for a
couple of days yet the final figure we have to look to save. A lot of
people in East Lindsey and Louth rely on local council services. Are
you ready for the cutbacks? We have been ready for some time, Peter,
for this. We have been anticipating a big cut back. The scenario is
planned for up to 35% over the next three years. We have actually taken
precautionary steps, taken up with arm merged services project, and we
are setting up our companies and merged five of power back office
services. This will save £20 million over the next 10 years. In
addition to that, what we have done... For your council tax payers
who are watching, what will they notice? What services will go?
very hopeful no services will actually go, Peter, and we are
working very hard to insure their is not a vast reduction in any of
the services we provide. We had just completed a restructured
through hour company, and we have identified more savings. We are
very proactive. We have been proactive for two three years to
ensure we are ready to face the future. We have done this work
because obviously we knew we could not go on as we were in a respect.
We are very hopeful we will not be reducing any of our frontline
services, at all. We are looking positively. Thank you very much
indeed. Carl Mimms, can you say the same? Yes, the difference there was
interesting. She said there was going to more than the headline
figure but I think there will be less on Hull. As a number of one 
off grants being sent to councils, like the working Neighbourhood Fund,
which is going to finish next year under Labour, but the government
has put money back into it to help councils like Hull, but it will not
be taken into account today. you're watching and you pay council
tax in this area, what services will go? I am hopeful, we will not
cut services completely. How do we deliver it in a different way to
make ends meet without removing his serve us all together? That is the
task for every council up and down the country. Thank you very much
indeed. Most grateful to you both. How do you feel about the cuts to
council services? Where should the money be saved? If you got some
ideas, which could help these two, some suggestions, some thoughts,
In a moment, we are with the RSPCA as the cold weather leads to a rise
He died doing something he loved. Ryan Brown, who was from Rawcliffe
near Goole, was taking part in his first ever parachute display when
he tried to make a turn too close to the ground. The 31 year old was
killed when he crashed to the floor in front of hundreds of people at
the fundraising event in Bridlington in August. An inquest
heard today he was an experienced jumper. The coroner recorded a
verdict of accidental death. Phillip Norton was at the hearing.
Ryan Brown's family at Hull Coroners Court, to hear how the 31 
year old died. He was killed in front of hundreds of people as he
made his first ever parachute display jump. Described as a
competent skydiver, he had completed more than 330 jumps. But
a fundraising music festival in Bridlington turned into tragedy.
The inquest heard from the team leader for the jump who said Ryan
Brown had not slow down enough and as a result he was taken over the
landing area and towards a tree. That is where he attempted to make
a sharp turn by pulling hard on his left toggle. Mr Armstrong said it
was too sharp and to close to the ground. As a result, he accelerated,
and went into a horizontal position. He hit to the ground between 50 60
mph. Ryan was airlifted to Scarborough hospital. But, despite
the efforts of paramedics, he never regained consciousness and died
from multiple injuries. He was keen to progress himself and saw
something he wanted to do. He was a very good parachutist, an
experienced skydiver, and a top fellow. A very inspirational
character and once again, a great loss. Genuinely, a great loss.
inquest heard Ryan was due to move to the United States to live with
his fiancee the month after his death, which happened on his
father's 60th birthday. Obviously, it was a tragic incidents, tragic
mistake made by Ryan, and one the family have to live with but they
do say he was dying doing something he was passionate about and he will
be very sorely missed. Recording a verdict of accidental death,
coroner Geoffrey Saul said he was happy Ryan's parachute was in good
condition. And that his death was a result of a radical manouevre close
to the ground. He offered his condolences to Ryan's family.
Doctors in Hull say thousands of people who are entitled to the flu
jab could be putting their lives at risk by choosing not to have it.
Last year more than 45,000 people had the vaccination. But so far
this year the number is down by 10%. Doctors believe patients are put
off because this season. Jabs contain a swine flu vaccine. Flu is
a nasty illness. Sometimes people think it's a bad cold but a serious
illness and you are laid up in bed for up to a week and you don't feel
well for a fortnight because of a post viral effects. It's a very
serious illness and people with underlying health care problems, it
can be a serious matter. Students in Hull are occupying a
University building in a protest at increased tuition fees. They are
demonstrating against the plans, which could see fees rise to £9.000
a year. The protest started this morning. The students say they will
continue until their message is heard. People will not come to
university. It will put off working class people to come to
university. When they see £9,000 a year, on top of maintenance costs,
students have to pay as well. Free fruit and vegetables are being
planted on roundabouts, flower boxes and parks in Boston in a bid
to tackle obesity. The Lincolnshire town was labelled as the country's
most obese in 2006. Now more than 30% of the population of
Lincolnshire is obese. The national average is just 21.8%. That means
Lincolnshire is 9% higher. The new plan has been launched today by TV
botanist David Bellamy, as Jake Zuckerman reports.

Launching a project that could see fruit and veg popping up in the
most unlikely places. It's called Grow2eat. The council's hoping to
encourage communities to grow their own food, by providing land and
expert help. Ace Study has recently been done which shows people that
have their own land and grow their own food go to the doctors less,
they are much more physically active. The in the last 50 years,
we have forgotten how important tasting food and growing things and
finding out where the food comes from. And in future that food could
be coming from here. The Council wants to make community growing
spaces in public areas and one of those will be here in the town
Central Park with these disused former tennis courts will be ripped
up and turned into a vegetable garden. It's not just the obvious
bases. The council is putting planters full of fruit and veg here
in the town centre, for people to pick and enjoy. It's always a good
idea to grow your own vegetables, I would be up for that. It gets
families working together, children involved. A great idea. Once you
started, you will love it and I think you will continue to do that.
It's nice to have your own vegetables at home. The project is
modelled on a scheme that has transformed the town of Todmorden
in West Yorkshire, where they aim to become self sufficient in
vegetables. We will be operating communal gardens and growing things
in our sheltered housing units. We will be encouraging the residents
to get involved and to grow and eat what they are producing.

by improving resident's diet and fitness, the scheme will prove its

coming in from the east. But what is getting us exciting is
Thursday's information. Weather warnings are in place. This is
coming all the way from the Arctic and it will be very cold. It will
get very better with a risk of frost. It could last until
Christmas at the earliest. Another plunge in the north. But it is

ahead, a bit better on Wednesday. A risk of showers and on Thursday,

from you! The RSPCA is encouraging the owners of animals to take more
care of them. The organisation has dealt with more than 5,000 calls in
just seven days last week. We went to meet a representative as they
went on patrol in last week's cold weather. After a fortnight of snow
and ice, dozens of people have contacted the RSPCA, concerned
about horses. Checking them is the first job of the day for Sarah.
They have got nice, thick cakes. She met up with the owners of these
horses. A couple of brothers have come on. It is looking a bit thin.
That is just because she has had problems. After checking their food
and drinking water... She was reassured that everything was fine.
They are all in great condition. This piece of land is fantastic. It
is as close to a natural habitat as you can get. Natural cover and
plenty of water. They get fed as well. They are much better off than
many others. We met a dog in an emergency. She had been called to
an animal, hit by a car. Jobs like these come in all year round but
getting to them in the snow has been difficult. I am going forward
but it is not easy. It makes the job really hard. All sorts of
things make it difficult. It is dangerous as well. Animals need us
and we must be in one piece. Keeping animals warm has been a big
issue, even for rescued dogs at the RSPCA's re Housing Centre. They are
very cold even with all this protection. Other dogs have not
been as fortunate. Sarah checked on another in Mahal which had just a
plastic garden table for shelter.     Hull. She is still working on the
case and we cannot show you what she found. More things to check on
outside. This time, a couple of horses. She found them eating
thorny branches. There was not any apparent sign of food. They have
obviously been struggling. They are in pretty good condition and that
is not an issue but these facilities are just not good enough.
The shelter is not good enough. Nothing for them to eat either.
They must have supplementary in bet, really.    in there, really.

Plenty of response with regard to the snow clearing from the roads.

Scunthorpe United's plans for an all seater stadium have been hit by
financial problems today. Here is our correspondent. We have not
found out much but it tells you something about the passion of
football supporters. They want to keep terracing at one end of
Glanford Park. They have to make Abbey Stadium an all seater by the
start of next season but they will not be any grants for coming.    to
A report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 96 people died
recommended that all seater grounds must be safer but they are
disappearing. They want to keep their last remaining facilities
here. It is great for the atmosphere and the banter between
supporters. It is part of English football and it is a tradition to
stand up at the football grounds. All of the rugby and the
Horseracing and rock concerts, people can stand up and watch their
sport. But we are being discriminated against because of
Hillsborough. They are not likely to get any financial help to
restore these facilities. The local MPs are think the scheme is
expensive.    the local MP thinks. We have had average crowds of 5000
and some people have been standing right from the beginning. It has
always been very safe. It does appear to be an over reaction for a
small ground. We would lose more than 1000. It is very difficult. We

How will this end? We have got plenty of support with standing
because it is traditional football in many people's opinions. But the
odds are stacked against them, it must be set. Hull City are five
matches unbeaten after a 0 0 draw with Crystal Palace. The Tigers
have continued their recent run. Just a couple of points above
relegation. It is another point gain. But if we want to make
progress in this table, we have got to put these performances in to
victories. The Hereford United match has been postponed. Despite
the efforts of a number of volunteers, the pitch has not
melted after freezing weather. Boston United have got home
advantage in the second round of the FA Trophy. The Pilgrims play
either Cirencester or Gloucester at York Street. Grimsby Town travelled
to Chasetown or Kettering. Both Many people might have been a
boarding the City centres in the icy weather but a group of waxwings,
often found in Scandinavia have been making themselves at home in
Lincoln. They are traditionally a sign of a bad winter. As we report,
they could be here for some time. These winter conditions are
difficult for us. But for these visitors, they are a welcome oasis.
They are waxwings. They have travelled more than 1,000 miles to
Lincoln's Tentercroft Street, where they are delighting birdwatchers
and shoppers alike. They are beautiful. I cannot say I have ever
seen that before. They are natives of Scandinavia. The favourite
winter meal for them is rowan berries. You are not likely to get
a rowan tree in the local supermarket car park. This winter
they have come here in large numbers because the crop at home
has not been very good. They have been many this year obviously
because of the very cold climate. They have come up his sleeve for
food because they have run out of berries. They have come up earlier
than normal. If    they have come up here for food. People are coming
around and watching them and it is great. We usually get half a dozen
at the most but we have got more than 50 here, fantastic. Well worth
this. Then they will be bombed. Thanks to the planting of rowan
trees, they might be in a supermarket car park may you.
