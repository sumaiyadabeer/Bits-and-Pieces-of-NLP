This is not a job. I'm not looking for bloody sales people,
I'm looking for someone who's got a brain that's going to start a business with me.
Heading to London, 16 of Britain's entrepreneurial elite,
keen to start a company.
I'm going to inject £250,000 into a business, your business
and you're going to run it.
On offer, a 50 50 partnership with the nation's toughest investor.
If you sit in the office for three hours and do nothing,
or three weeks, or three months, I ain't going to be a happy bunny.
Passionate about new money spinning ventures,
Lord Sugar's on the hunt for a winning business partner.
With respect, that's not professional.
If I can see something going wrong, or the ship sinking,
I'll jump in myself.
We can do it, we can do it. Come on. Let's go!
It's a deal worth fighting for.
Everybody stop. We're not making any money here.
16 candidates...
I don't appreciate you guys laughing...
You earn respect and that how it's done.
..12 tough weeks...
We're not...
One life changing opportunity.
You're fired.
You're fired. I don't think I could go into business with you.
You're fired.
Previously on The Apprentice:
I expect you to sell that stuff
and smell which item is the best seller.
Buy some more and just keep going, increasing your assets.
First umbrella sold for £10, folks.
Natasha's sales force...
  I'm interested in buying a nodding dog, actually.
  I know, they're fabulous.
..got the plot...
We'll take 20 dogs, please. Thank you.
  ..while Melody's team...
  We've got the travel kettle...
..did not.
  Why are we selling travel things?
  I'm a bit confused by the randomness.
Helen's sales plan made it worse.
Would you like to take a bulk order to save you a trip to your wholesalers?
All our wholesalers come to us.
With Jim on a roll...
We can't be conservative, we need to reinvest in stock. Do you agreed?
..Natasha bottled out.
If we reinvest in any stock, we're going to be carrying too much stock.
  In the boardroom...
  Did you reinvest?
  We did, yeah.
  How much did you spend?
  Just over £20.
  She beat the other team...
  20 quid?
  I made a decision...
  Are you having a laugh?
..but it was a hollow victory.
There's no balls, no guts, no reinvestment.
For Helen, a first defeat.
The most simple principle of business and you make a big mistake.
Tom found his voice.
Helen has never started her own business
and Melody runs a business,
which, unsurprisingly, is all to do with talking.
But this time Melody was lost for words.
With regret,
Melody, you're fired.
Thank you, Lord Sugar.
She became the 11th casualty of the boardroom.
Now five remain
to fight for the chance to become Lord Sugar's business partner.
One week left.
I've made you breakfast.
Oh, Tash!
Time for Lord Sugar to decide who will go into the final.
I think we'll have interviews today.
  I think it looks likely, but you just never know, do you?
  No.
Good morning.
'This is Lord Sugar's office.
'He would like to meet you in the City. The cars leave in 30 minutes.
Do we have to wear anything in particular?
Jim, did they say whether or not we're having interviews today?
No, I went to ask questions and they...
  Shut you down?
  ..hung up.
Are you wearing your interview suit?
I'm wearing what I always wear. I'll look a million dollars, regardless.
Jim, that's true(!)
We're at the business end of things, aren't we, girls?
Good morning.
Good morning, Lord Sugar.
Well, here we are at the One New Change,
which is a shopping mall right in the heart of the City of London.
And in this shopping mall you have many franchises,
particularly fast food franchises.
Your task this week is to create the next fast food chain restaurant.
I've located two empty shops for you in the centre of London,
you're going to kit them out with your restaurant ideas.
I'm going to arrange some staff for you,
so that you can put on a proper fast food experience.
Then I'm going to bring in some industry experts
and they're going to advise me which of fast food restaurant has got legs.
  Everything clear?
  Yes, Lord Sugar.
  OK. Good luck.
Thank you.
What if the team that won this are the finalists?
Whoa!
  Oh, yeah!
  Oh, my God!
It's good that we've got three minds against two on the other team
and even though we had some problems before, in the previous task, all the air's been cleared.
Fast food is big business and Lord Sugar expects each team
to bring a new and original fast food brand to the market.
I've got a BA Honours in Hospitality Management
and one of the things within my degree, we had our own restaurant.
  We had to create a theme for the restaurant, brand it, do the full works.
  Excellent.
We've definitely got a very strong team.
Oh, my God. We're going to have to design it!
The teams have 48 hours to turn empty shells
into brand new fast food outlets...
  Wow!
  Fantastic!
  This is where we are.
  Goodness me.
Right. It's big.
Bain marie, hot cupboard, we've got a hot plate...
then launch them to Lord Sugar and his restaurant industry experts.
..Its inception through to completion.
We've got to just concentrate on the concept. What is our USP?
If you don't mind, and I think you'll agree, I'll lead in this one.
I'm just really keen to take this forward,
I've got people behind me who are really supportive.
  Yeah.
  I'll try and support you from knowledge from my degree.
  Cheers.
I wasn't going to take no for an answer.
'I've got two girls on board who'll appreciate a wee bit of direction.'
It's the big one and I suppose this is another time for me to shine.
I'm happy to put myself forward. I like being project manager
and I have run food outlets before.
  I liked being project managed by you.
  Great.
  Thank you, Helen.
  Dream team.
Very, very good. I'm wondering about Mexican and West Indian.
  West Indian's been really popular...
  Next job, choose a cuisine.
I wouldn't want to do Spanish, there are a few Spanish chains.
British, is there a fast food chain at that just does pie and mash?
It will be an easy model to replicate.
  What thoughts do we have about pie and mash?
  It tends to be heavy,
  which tends to mean male rather than female.
  That's right.
So, we want to give it quite a female touch.
  What about mini pies?
  Mmm.
They're are more suitable for ladies.
Mexican just jumps out to me. Really fun.
I'm imagining, sort of, cactuses and people wearing sombreros.
You can do a healthy option.
You've got fajitas, chimichangas, burritos, nachos.
I'm not sure about Mexican, but I'll go with it.
Do you guys eat in a lot of Mexican restaurants?
  I do, actually.
  I personally eat in quite a few chains.
I would definitely go for Mexican. Brilliant.
Next, decide who will create the brand
and who will invent the dishes.
Natasha, with your hospitality experience...
  I can't cook.
  You can't cook?
  I can't cook.
  You can't cook?
  Have you seen me cook?
Never, but you did a hospitality degree.
I've got a degree. I don't have an enormous amount of work experience.
Where I've done better throughout the task has been branding, design, creativity.
'Jim has got in Natasha somebody who has a hospitality degree,'
but because she doesn't want to cook,
he's agreed for her to go on the branding team
and that is not using the skills that she clearly has
to the best for the team's outcome.
I don't know much about the baking or the making of these products.
  Do you feel like you've been strong on the branding and the concept?
  Yeah.
The only thing I'm a bit wary of is being project manager.
I would prefer to have ultimate autonomy
  over the concept and the branding.
  Hm mm, hm mm.
That's what I do on other stuff.
That's the where all my inventions have come through.
  That's what I've been doing for the last eight years is...
You go on that side and I will go on the food,
but I want to be kept in contact all the time.
I mean, I'm trusting you here, Tom. Big time.
10.45 am.
Banjos, sombreros, moustaches, cactuses...
Hunting for inspiration, Jim's branding team.
  Have you ever been to Mexico?
  No. Have you?
  No. Do you know much Mexican?
  Literally nothing.
"Arriba, arriba"   what's that? Is that Mexican?
  Arriba! That's very Mexican.
  Arriba!
Arriba! With the sombrero.
I'm thinking of a happy Mexican  looking man with a big moustache.
  Would you like me to walk you through the process?
  Please do.
Fast food must be quick and fresh,
but the secret to success isn't just the food.
It's the system.
One chicken taco, please.
How long does a takeaway client spend here?
During peak time, we've run anywhere between 85 and 90 transactions per 15 minutes.
  So the line's moving at lightning speeds.
  What do most people buy?
Burritos of the most popular.
I'm trying to think of something else outside of what's been done before.
  What food don't you do?
  The chilli con carne we haven't done.
We're busy doing a trial system on a soup at the moment.
  What's it called?
  It's a tortilla soup.
Northwest London.
A catering plant.
Commonly used by the fast food industry,
off site catering keeps down costs.
  We're going to do the three mini pies and two main ones.
  Lovely.
Making a start on her all British menu, project manager Helen.
So I've got steak and red wine, chicken and mushroom and spinach, broccoli and Cheddar.
So this is the cheese and onion?
There's too much cheese in.
  Right.
  I don't like it.
Can we just change that?
Once agreed, the food will be mass produced and delivered to the restaurants tomorrow.
I am really happy with my pies.
I'm a bit worried about my costing on my steak pie
because we've got loads of really good quality steak in there.
It's quite a lot, isn't it?
Food industry experts are going to be coming and judging our products.
They know good quality ingredients, so I'd rather take a little bit of a hit on the margin
and have a really great products.
So that can be signed off.
With his team leader fine tuning the fillings, inventor Tom, charged with branding their pies...
Girls love mini things.
..is in a baby boutique.
The funness of that   could we turn that into a mini pie?
Like a flying pie?
I think I've... taken some great inspiration.
We were trying to sort of create a new image, a sort of a modern image
around this mini pie,
and also bring in that kind of very, very British theme.
A little bit of old meets new.
Some names that we've got going on at the moment is Micro Pie,
Pie In The Sky, Brit Pie.
That's a very good name.
"Qypie." So...
Qype, Qypie, Qy... P, Y.
Qypie.
I've just dyslexically misread something and potentially come up with some genius ideas.
Pie being spelt P, Y.
  'OK, yeah.'
  So you could have "MyPy"   M, Y, P, Y.
MyPy.
  Say Hello To Pie?
  Say Hi To Pie?
  MyPy   say hi to British Pies.
I quite like that, Tom.
Hot from his research...
So on the first dish we'll make chilli beef.
..Jim's takeaway of Mexican ideas goes straight to his chef for a trial run.
  Second one is a fajita kit and the third one is a Mexican soup.
  Will we get the chilli on the go?
  Yep. OK, let's start with that.
While Jim turns up the heat...
That's good.
  Happy with that?
  Yeah.
  Great.
..his branding team has gone cold.
Sombravo?
This is... It's a struggle, isn't it?
It's difficult to think of Mexican names.
They always have like, "El something", don't they?
Like "El..."
What does el mean?
I have no idea.
Hiya, Jim. It's Tash.
Me and Susan, we're struggling. I'll be honest with you. Erm...
What about a name Caracas, as in, you know, the little Mexican shaking things?
  Caracas.
  Oh, yeah. Caracas.
Yeah! That's a good one. Jim, I really like that.
I think they're actually called maracas, aren't they? Ma ra cas?
They're called maracas, yeah. What does Caracas mean?
I don't know. It's just a name that came to me.
I thought it was catchy.
Caraca's. I like it.
Name agreed, it needs a Mexican image.
If we wanted to be a little bit creative,
maybe we could do something like red peppers, yellow peppers, green peppers.
Peppers isn't necessarily Mexican, though.
I strongly feel that we should just have a sombrero. It's simple.
The reason why I'm going along the peppers route, yeah,
is I'm trying to make the pepper iconic to our brand.
But it's really NOT Mexican.
Can we just give Jim one more call?
Hi, guys.
Jim, I think putting peppers in the logo is going to be very, very dangerous
with regards to our actual theme.
If you've got a better idea, put it forward, yeah?
  I already put forward my idea of having a traditional...
  Jim?
  Oi! I'm not finished, Natasha.
It's Tash. The suggestion that I've made is that we take peppers, you know, like...
I'm feeling so uncomfortable with this concept. I can't...
I honestly just can't stop thinking about how much of failure this is going to be.
Susie, you have more experience in Mexican food than Natasha and I,
so we're not going to use a pepper in the logo.
OK. Now that I've got your... I just wanted to make sure...
If I say "black", Susan says "white".
I haven't got a problem with someone saying,
"I don't think that's going to work, but I've got a better idea,
and what's that it is." We haven't got that.
Here, girls, please work together to get a successful outcome, please.
Jim knows that Natasha and I don't get along,
so I think it was a mistake that he put Natasha and myself together.
  Sorry, Tash, I don't mean to...
  Don't worry. Focus on the job. Not a problem. It's fine.
So who came up with the name?
  I came up with the name Caraca's.
  Who came up with the menu?
  I did.
There's a theme developing.
7.00pm.
  'Hi, Tom!'
  Now, do we have any names for our pies?
I think we should have a mixture of anything...
anybody that we think has been influential to Britain
and how it's developed.
I like the kind of link of British names or, like...
was Byron the guy who was writing at the same time as Shakespeare?
Um, there was...erm...
Was Byron a vegetarian, do we know?
  I haven't got a clue.
  Me neither.
What about... We had all the explorers. We had William Drake.
  Yeah.
  'Christopher Columbus.'
  Um, didn't Columbus discover the potato in America?
  Yes, he did.
'So we could have Columbus mash.'
I love the way this is coming together.
It's either utter madness, or it's complete genius.
Back at the restaurants...
We want this wall to be vibrant. We want it to be busy.
Both teams have interior designers to help turn their vision into reality.
We're being quite innovative. We're introducing a Mexican soup.
You know, your jalapeno peppers, you know, your chilli beans.
What I'm thinking, Tash... feel free to jump in...
black... black background, "Caraca's"
at the top with the sombrero.
Come in here...
"All our things are 100% British."
Walk in... You walk in, and you see Big Ben...
You walk in the door here...
Yeah, and you see Big Ben, and you see the bus.
  I think I see Big Ben over there, and I think I see the bus here.
  Right.
And I think I see this almost as just a big, blue wall.
"MyPy", or...
"Welcome to MyPy."
It's very scary to put my confidence and trust in Tom when it's such a massive thing to me.
I'm nervous about if Tom's been able to replicate what's in my head.
That's probably my biggest worry.
I've just got to make a decision.
8.00am.
In London's West End,
both restaurant mock ups take shape.
Oh, wow!
  Oh, Caraca's!
  Welcome to Caraca's!
Six hours to rehearse service
and perfect systems before the teams face their first customers.
  It's pretty funky, isn't it?
  It does.
  It's really funky! Oh, wow!
Wow!
  This carpet is brilliant.
  I love it.
  Wow.
That'll be our logo with the Union Jack on it.
I think it looks really good. I'm really proud of our concept.
We've just got to hope that Lord Sugar likes it tomorrow,
otherwise me and Tom are going to get our arse kicked again!
"Say hi to British pies"
Nightingale, Drake...
And the Columbus.
  Columbus?
  Yes.
  He's British?
I think so.
  Tom?
  Columbus is British?
Oh, you are kidding me!
Christopher Columbus was British.
  Right.
  Still, there we are.
  Thank you.
  Thank you.
The signature meal is £4.50.
Organised by Lord Sugar, the teams get extra staff, but THEY must manage them.
If we can get them to have the signature dish and the side with the drink, that takes us to £7.
  Everyone confident?
  I think so, yeah.
  Brilliant.
  20 past is perfect timing.
Let's have a little trial run, shall we?
Hello. Welcome to MyPy.
Have you eaten 100% British before?
I haven't, no. What would you recommend?
I would recommend our signature dish. It's a variety of three pies, each one of them.
  Oh, fab. OK. That sounds really good.
  Yeah?
77, 79, 80...we have a winner.
OK. Hang on. The foil needs to come off the pies. Yeah?
Cool. That was a good practise run.
  Yeah.
  We want the foils off?
  Yes.
  They look fab, don't they? Do you like them?
  They look absolutely stunning.
At Caraca's, out back and working solo, the hired kitchen hand.
Out front, head chef Jim fine tunes the restaurant decor.
  Right or left?
  Move it to the left. Left, left, left, left.
Jim, you should, please, Jim, organise the kitchen the way you want to manage.
We are not ready. I just can tell you this.
You know what? I'll come into the kitchen in one minute,
we'll go through everything, and I'll stay in the kitchen with you.
  I need help, and I need to talk to you about everything.
  Excellent.
  Happy?
  Yeah, that's good.
I'm just the hand. You are the brain today, so you have to tell me how you want to manage it.
You must think about the things that it takes time to do, because the service must be quick.
This is what I want. I want to be able to get hot chilli. I want to have hot soup, hot fajitas.
So you want to prepare the fajita during the service?
Did you think about this? Because to make a fajita...
  It takes a bit of time.
  You organise the kitchen the way you want, but...
I'll do the nachos. I'm nacho man.
  I'm macho nacho.
  You're the nacho man!
Half an hour to go.
Susie, they're walking around like this here,
read the menu, and then they're here.
  OK? Everybody happy with the customer service routine?
  What's the time?
  It's ten to.
  Ten minutes.
  Five!
  OK. We're ready. We just need some customers.
Let's go.
  Oh, I'm excited.
  Yeah!
2pm. The fledgling fast food chains open for service.
  Susan, Susan? Good afternoon.
  How are you doing? Are you well?
Two hours to serve 100 paying customers.
We are just literally opening up, but we're ready to take some orders.
If you would like to follow me, I'll take you to your seats.
Hi, guys. Welcome to Caraca's. How are you doing?
Would you like to eat in or take away today?
  Eat in is fine, thanks.
  You would like to eat in. Let me show you to your table.
Lucky customers!
  OK. I'll be with you in just one second.
  Thank you very much.
Where are the extra chairs? There's more people than we have seats.
They all want to sit in. What the hell are we going to do?
  Welcome to MyPy. Have you ever eaten 100% British before?
  I don't know.
  Hello there. How is it going?
  Can I have the Nightingale?
  The meal deal, then?
  Yes.
  Would you like gravy with that?
That's £4.50, please. Thank you.
The first order is ready to go.
Ah! So you've got all different fillings in your one?
  Yes.
  So you get to try all three of them.
Welcome to Caraca's. Do any of you guys have any questions with the menu?
OK. So we've loads here. Four fajitas, please. Four fajitas.
That's £7.75. Just need to wait for your order to come through.
  Your food will be ready in about ten minutes, is that OK?
  I ordered a chicken fajita,
expected that fairly soon. It's supposed to be fast food. I've been here ten minutes now.
The customers are just getting really impatient with the food.
  They should have melted the cheese.
  Uh huh.
  Very cold.
  I'm so sorry.
  That's OK.
  It wasn't supposed to be cold.
  I didn't think so.
  I'm sorry.
That's OK.
They spent so long today talking about the decor and putting up posters,
they forgot to organise a system that works.
Nachos, fajita, fajita, fajita...
There is nothing fast about this restaurant.
  Helen, up next. You're doing a great job.
  You too.
  Well done.
That's right, stacked full of steak, you know what I mean?
It is what it says.
It's going good. It's going really, really well.
Our turn around time is...
I'd say it's less than three minutes. I think we're fast food.
  Thanks, Tom. Well done.
  Yeah!
Thanks, ladies. Bye.
The test run is done.
That was absolutely insane.
The queue was massive. A load of people left because they didn't get the food that they wanted.
The problem was that the nachos and the fajitas were cold.
  Give me solutions.
  They need to all be in the oven.
I honestly can't believe he was serving cold nachos and fajitas.
You need to make sure every fajita, every portion of nachos, is absolutely perfect.
It will be, yeah.
Before Lord Sugar turns up tomorrow.
"Waited a long time to be served. "
"Not quite fast food."
A chance to pick over customer feedback.
"Friendly but slow."
Positives: "There aren't enough pie shops. Absolutely loved the food.
"Great idea, 100% British."
  And the negative stuff?
  "Very difficult to eat out of a box."
I prefer that one, visually, but if it doesn't work
on a practical level, we've got to go for that one tomorrow.
"Expected nachos and fajita to be warm."
"Crazy waitress."
A lot of negatives, Susie.
  God, I look horrible.
  You know, it's a learning process.
I'm glad we did it today.
Could you imagine if Lord Sugar came today?
7am.
Today, both teams will have to demonstrate their restaurant concepts
to Lord Sugar and his industry experts.
You know the key today, guys, is to stay calm.
If we come across as frantic and frazzled, Susie, it will create a really bad atmosphere.
I think I'm comfortable about the service.
We don't want to go any faster, put it that way.
We just want to make sure the quality is dead on for every single meal.
Jim, I was thinking about this last night, and I think
the process we had yesterday was too slow, and me running around
the entire store by myself wasn't right.
For today, we should have two sections of the counter,
Natasha here, me here.
When they order their food, they can wait there, take their food and then sit where they want.
  I think that is a better idea.
  I agree.
They've got the morning to apply the lessons from yesterday.
Today we have VIP...
  That means no mistakes!
  We're going to go slower and make sure the food is right.
  Bravo.
That's nice and hot.
That's cheesy.
Happy?
  Mmm, good stuff.
  Cheers.
Lunch time.
Is this ready?
Are you ready?
Well done. Let's make this as good as we can make it, OK?
Yeah, absolutely.
Joining Lord Sugar, some of fast food's biggest players,
including international brands Domino's and McDonald's.
Here they come. Oh, my God!
Here we are.
Hello. Good morning. Welcome to Caraca's.
It's a brand new Mexican restaurant. I'll give you a menu, sir...
The experts will give marks out of ten in four categories.
Welcome to Caraca's.
We have got three main dishes. We've got our signature classic chilli...
Category number one, customer service.
I'm going to have the chicken fajitas.
  The chicken fajitas?
  Yeah.
Can I recommend some nachos to go with that?
Yeah, if you want to, yeah, sure.
Service!
One chicken fajita, one chicken fajita.
There is your receipt, and your food will come out just here.
I quite like the idea of chicken fajitas, but can I have it without peppers?
One, two... waiting for one fajita, no peppers, and two fajitas, normal.
It will take a little while.
  Slow.
  Where's Lord Sugar's nachos?
There's Lord Sugar. That's Lord Sugar.
We're running about five, ten minutes, top end,
so we're doing pretty well today, thank you.
  That's great, thank you.
  Service!
Second category   the standard of meal and menu.
Well, it's not bad.
It's quite tasty, but it's a bit messy.
I can't grip it. I can't get hold of it.
It would be all over me if I attempted to pick it up.
  I don't think they'd be making much margin out of that fajita.
  What was the retail price of it?
I don't think the branding's too bad. I know the sombrero is a cliche.
Third category, the restaurant's brand identity.
  I think, in terms of the vibrancy...
  You would be very clear as to what you would expect.
You know what you're getting. That's important.
  Everyone got their food OK, didn't they?
  Really quick, too.
  Good.
Good, good. Good, good.
And finally, marks for demonstrating how their concepts will work long term.
Good afternoon, folks, and welcome.
We are Caraca's, a Mexican food restaurant.
The first thing you notice about the restaurant is the name, the Caraca's.
It is incredibly catchy, very memorable and is very fun to say, and also very Mexican sounding.
We tried to add a bit of personality onto our brand,
by introducing the sombrero. When we think of sombreros, we think of the sun, fun, and Mexico.
Talk me through how it works in terms of the numbers at lunch.
If you take an hour, how many customers do you hope to serve,
spending how much? And with the margins, how many pounds profit
is that going to get you at gross level, in that hour?
Let's say that, erm...
we are looking at 60 people, over a two hour period, for lunch.
With an average spend, erm, of £7.
Which is, erm... for 60 people at £7, which is £4,800.
In terms of their, erm... In terms of their spend. Sorry?
Sorry, 40 people at... 60 people at £7 each, £420, of course.
On the brand identity, just wondering how these old world images
of sombreros, cacti, how those relate to contemporary.
We welcome our customers into our restaurant, we like to encourage them to hang up their sombrero.
Even though it's a fast food restaurant,
it's also an opportunity to have a bit of chill time,
a bit of downtime within a very strong Mexican environment.
We welcome the opportunity for you to come here. I hope you enjoyed the food.
I believe there was one patron in who hasn't actually paid,
so Lord Sugar, if you could settle up before you go, I would appreciate that.
Thanks very much, folks.
Next, tested on the same four categories, MyPy.
  Good afternoon, Lord Sugar.
  Hello.
  Welcome to MyPy. Have you ever eaten 100% British before?
  Yes.
  Yes.
  Well, you will enjoy the quality of our ingredients, then.
I can have a steak and red wine.
  Would you like mashed potato and mushy peas with that?
  Both.
  Check on.
  There we go, Sir... Lord Sugar.
  That was quick.
  We are fast food.
Hello, welcome to MyPy. 100% British ingredients.
  A Drake and a Nightingale, please. Thanks very much.
  Check on.
These trays aren't big enough.
I'll have the Mini Drake and the Mini Columbus.
In terms of the branding, it's got one simple idea.
The provenance in being 100% British is a very simple but a very strong and contemporary message.
Shit! Argh!
After the pies, the pitch.
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the first MyPy restaurant.
We're hoping that one day, there could be 500 of these across the country.
MyPy, which as you can see is unashamedly 100%,
completely, brilliantly British. Say hi to British pies.
  I hand you to Helen, for more details about the food.
  We did a survey yesterday,
with 52 people that came to our restaurant. We were really pleased with the results,
the professionalism of staff, our knowledge of the menu.
It covered the menu, the appeal of the menu, the...
  Brand.
  ..value for money.
  Brand.
  Tom, you're putting me off! We're so excited about it,
that's why we're getting carried away. We were really pleased with the feedback.
Thank you very much, Helen, sorry to interrupt you.
The pies were very well filled, it tasted like it had a very high quality ingredient.
I think your price points are very competitive. But how are your gross margins?
For the meal deals, 23%, which we thought was quite good cost of sales.
I think you can tell from the steak, it is slightly more, at 41%.
We really wanted to make sure that we balanced quality with margin, to get the best of both worlds.
A question about menu. Lovely, warming pies in winter, what would you do,
  if anything, different in summer?
  OK. Erm...
cold pies, for example. Cold pork pies can be very... erm...
popular in the summer.
Thank you.
  Good stuff.
  Yeah, well done.
Goodness. That's a test for anyone.
We have a strong brand and we believe we got good food, served fast.
The scores will follow.
To be served up by Lord Sugar in the boardroom.
You've come so far, you've worked so hard, and you really feel like the actual brand belongs to you.
I'm glad it's over and I want to hear what the results are.
On the day and at the 11th hour, we pulled it out of the bag.
I think we've got a very strong chance of winning this task.
I'm just so determined to get through today, get through the boardroom and make it into the final.
I relish every opportunity
to have a dialogue with Lord Sugar and tell him why I'm suited to be his business partner.
I think I'd make a stunning business partner for Lord Sugar.
I'd be completely gutted if I was to go out at this stage.
They've all got something to offer, but have they got everything that it takes?
I don't think so. Have I? I definitely think so.
I believe in myself and I should be Lord Sugar's business partner.
You can go through to the boardroom now.
  Good afternoon.
  Good afternoon, Lord Sugar.
  Let's find out what went on.
Venture, off you go.
We quickly identified that we wanted to go with Mexican food.
Mexican stood out as something that most people seem to enjoy.
Mexican is hot. Sorry to use the pun, but it is very fashionable out there, it's a good choice, I think.
Caraca's, the name, where did that come from?
I came up with Caraca's as one that was a little bit catchy.
It might be a bit catchy, but not to a Venezuelan.
It is the capital of Venezuela, it transpired.
  Which is not in Mexico, is that right?
  No, it's not.
Jim thought that Caracas was maracas, so it was by error.
  You thought it was maracas? They are Spanish, maracas.
  Yeah.
  Be honest, you thought it was a made up word, all of you.
  What happened in the dummy run?
It was all hands to the pump, making the restaurant look well. I went into the kitchen,
and it was absolute carnage.
The real carnage happened over the order system, or should I say the lack of a system that worked.
I think it was Susan who identified that, and pushed forward addressing it for the second day.
Good team leader, ladies?
A couple of decisions were made and then turned around,
a couple of indecisive moments.
  Susan?
  He was OK.
  All right.
  All right, now, Logic. Helen, team leader, yeah?
  That's right, yes.
I think it was a very good team effort, we worked together well.
Where did the brand name come from?
  That was Tom.
  Myself, it actually came from me misreading a sign.
We could have gone for sort of Ye Olde Traditional Pie Shoppe,
but I was always very keen to mix the tradition with the new,
and MyPy seemed to work very well.
Theirs was the disaster, they admitted it, they learned from it.
How did your dummy run go?
We actually did a dummy dummy run, at 1 o'clock, we did a practice and we pretended
some customers came through. And then myself and the chef practised a run.
If you'd let Helen do a little bit of talking for a moment.
  That would be nice.
  What did you do, Helen?
I decided that I was going to go to the kitchen and develop the product,
and Tom was going to do the concept and the branding. I was slightly nervous, because
that lent itself more to the project manager role. However, Tom said very clearly
  that he was used to the concept and the branding.
  OK. Now, let's see how we did do.
As you know, 13 advisers I pulled in there, that were going to look at the four main criteria.
The brand identity, the customer experience, the food,
obviously, and the most important thing, the long term viability.
Those guys were basically asked to mark it out of ten points.
They are far more experienced than me in this business,
and we're going to see what they felt.
Let's start with Caraca's, Karen.
Across those four categories,
they had an average score of four out of ten.
Right.
Nick. MyPy.
Helen and Tom averaged...
..seven out of ten.
Pies win.
Pies win. Very, very good.
Very well done. In the short period of time, you've come up with a concept which had some legs.
You two are in the final.
And you've done very well getting through to this stage.
Wow.
Go back to the house, have a good rest and I'll be in touch shortly.
  Thank you.
  Off you go.
(Thanks, Jim.)
Well, um... Venture.
I guess you must be sitting there wondering what your fate is, now that those two are in the final.
The good news is that two of you are going to be in the final.
The bad news is that one of you is going to be fired today.
Off you go.
Where I know it went wrong... the girls didn't play ball. Throwing toys out of the pram.
I was like Mother Teresa as opposed to project manager.
Because of the job I was doing, I didn't see the trail of destruction,
and you were at the centre of that, weren't you?
I honestly think I'm more suitable for this process
than Jim and Natasha put together and to get to the finals in this stage is something I really want.
I'm the perfect candidate to be Lord Sugar's business partner.
I do think Lord Sugar should fire Susan.
As soon as I came up with an idea, she shut me down.
"Don't agree with that, don't agree with that."
Disappointing to be in this position when the other two have got through to the final.
That's where I want to be. That's where I'm going to fight to be.
That's where I believe I should be.
  Hello?
  Could you send them in, please?
  Yes, Lord Sugar.
  Lord Sugar will see you now.
Now, we are the 11th week into this process.
I'm assuming that you three have some kind of superior knowledge
in order for you to have survived to this stage.
Yeah.
Nick's passed me a document here, a very interesting document. It actually belongs to the other team.
It deals very clearly and concisely with costings.
What this cost, what that cost.
They had a business model.
Can one of you at least tell me what the business plan was?
Where was the margins? How many did you expect to serve per hour?
Where is the equivalent of this document, even if it doesn't exist as a document?
Let it come out of someone's mouth.
I admit that none of us actually considered how long and how many people we would be able to serve.
Stop there a minute. This is a business proposition.
One of you is supposed to go into business with me.
There was a lack of communication. I don't recall a point when we actually even discussed as a group
the margins in the food, the turnaround time.
That's clear.
There was that embarrassing moment, Jim, when you were talking about 60 people at £7 at £4,200...
I know, I've lived with that all last night.
Mental arithmetic is a strong suit of mine and that was an uncharacteristic error.
But even on your maths, 420 quid, which is the correct calculation,
over a two hour period, you'd go bust.
My idea of fast food restaurants is that you go up, you order, you pay, you take, you go and you sit down.
All that is supposed to take no more than, believe it or not, a minute.
What was your system?
Oi, who wanted a nacho? That was your system.
Who wanted one of these fajitas? That was your system.
I did it as fast as I possibly could.
  Why was it slow?
  Just for the very nature of it, the equipment that we had and maybe the make up of it.
That, I'm sorry, that's not true.
The reason it was slow is that you didn't know
whether you were a fast food restaurant or a waitress restaurant.
What I would've done in their situation was put all hands to the pump, seeing front of house
that people were waiting and made something happen.
I couldn't see that wasn't happening. I was in naive bliss, to be honest.
What I learned from our data experience was we weren't getting the food out fast enough.
I was actually endeavouring to buy more time rather than actually...
You were trying to slow the people down so they didn't notice?
Essentially, yes. All I could do was look for a repair opportunity.
Natasha, I looked in your CV.
You actually have got some kind of degree in food and hospitality.
A BA honours in international hospitality management.
  Which includes understanding food and all that stuff?
  It does, yes.
It was a long time ago.
I've not continued within that kind of vocational career.
  Long time ago, you say this was?
  Yes.
Mmm.
Listen, now I want to talk about the food.
When I opened that cardboard box, the last time I saw something
looking like that was when my son's dog puked, to be honest.
It was bad.
Yes. I'm disappointed to hear that people reacted so badly to it.
Surely the priority should be the stuff must be good.
It must taste good, it must look good.
Jim should've found out in the Mexican restaurants he went to, what was the best seller,
how long did it take to make and what were the key ingredients that made the food taste delicious?
Jim, I don't feel you conducted your market research thoroughly enough.
You did say you were a macho nacho, didn't you, Jim?
Well, a bit of bravado there.
But... Lord Sugar, there's a deeper  lying issue that I was faced with.
  Go on then.
  It was like, I wasn't project manager, I was babysitter from afar.
The two ladies couldn't work constructively together.
As project manager, if you had an inclination that Susan
and I may have personal differences, why did you put us together?
I did have an inclination from the previous task very strongly.
  Right.
  I got feedback from you that you found Susan to be like a child to work with and very difficult.
  I don't mean to get personal.
  I'm not getting personal.
  I'd like to keep it as professional as possible.
  And that's exactly what I'm doing.
Are you saying, Jim, that you think that you kind of done this single handed really?
No, I felt as if I had complete excitability and at times even manic enthusiasm from Susan.
But at the other end of the scale I had apathy and despair.
What I think I'd like to do at the moment, I want to consult a bit more with Karen and Nick.
Susan, she's always got the right thing to say, hasn't she, in his boardroom?
What's she like out of here?
I've always said you need a sieve with Susan because
you have to work out what stuff is meaningful and what is meaningless.
Jim, push the food to one side, I haven't heard anything about a plan, a business plan.
Natasha says she can't cook but she has got skills in that area and she should've used them.
When she came into this process, she was jumping up and down,
had a real spark about her and some of that has been sapped away.
It's tough going, the 11 weeks.
Yes. But they've all gone through it.
  Can you send the three of them in, please?
Lord Sugar will see you now.
Susan, if one person's got to go here today, who do you think that should be out of these two?
In my honest opinion, Lord Sugar, Jim. He's a very charming man.
He's very good at selling, he's very good at communication, very good at talking but at the end of the day,
what you need is someone who will come up with original ideas.
Someone that can run a business and has natural entrepreneurial spirit.
Natasha, I'm going to ask you the same question.
I think Jim just isn't able to make decisions. He can't manage a team...
  What's the answer?
  Jim.
  Jim?
  100% Natasha.
I take that as a compliment, Jim. You've got a bit of a dark side and I think you're slightly underhand...
  I'm totally open.
  Actually not,
No, you're not because you give off a very strong charm and you've
  always charmed project managers and you know what, it didn't work with me.
  I'm totally open.
I've always said to you what I think.
I've said in his boardroom what I think.
I think you've got a dark underside to you.
It's called passion. It's called passion.
Jim, at the end of the day, there is a reason why you have
project managed twice and you have lost both tasks so badly.
So, who's responsible for this? Who is responsible for the failure of this task?
Who I think was responsible for this task is a toss up between
the two experts, the Mexican food expert and the hospitality expert.
Their expertise fell by the wayside and they were happy to watch me
flummox in the kitchen and not get food out quick enough.
Jim, I eat Mexican food, I'm not a Mexican food expert.
If I did a hospitality degree, I would be grabbing it by the scruff of the neck
and saying this suits me, like Helen did, this suits me,
I need to be on top of this because I know exactly what happens in a restaurant.
I don't know what happens.
Jim, I think the key thing is I don't work in hospitality.
  It's not anything that's of interest to me.
  You spent four years doing it. Four years of your adult life.
Absolutely, but the point is I work in construction property recruitment.
This isn't what it's about. It's about finding a task and playing to your strengths.
You're the person that's highlighting my degree and contextualising it, not me.
I'm saying, yes I did a degree but I don't claim to have an expertise in it.
You did also say that you ran a restaurant.
Do you think you're being hung out to dry, Jim, is that what you think?
In here, a pincer movement by two people who thought to themselves, you know what?
Jim looks like he'll get hung for this.
We won't let on that we didn't get it either and we didn't help and we didn't step in.
My task responsibility was over on the creative side.
You're all in the same boat. Don't give me, "my task responsibility".
This is everybody's place to pipe up and make the team win.
This degree that you've got, there was basic fundamental things in there.
It's like me saying I've got a degree in first aid.
But I see someone dying in the street and saying, sorry,
haven't done it for 10 years so I'm going to leave them alone.
The things that I honed in on in my degree weren't those points.
I wasn't interested in the food side, I wasn't interested in the restaurant side.
  You weren't interested in this task...
  Please have the decency to let me finish.
Were you interested in this task, genuinely?
  Did you give everything you could?
  Yes, I gave everything I could.
No, you didn't. If that's all you can give, that's not good enough.
I'm speaking, I'm taking the opportunity to speak.
I'm hearing things about...
  Well, please finish.
  I'd like to have the opportunity to speak.
Within my degree, I honed in on the areas I liked doing.
  At no point did I want to become a restaurateur.
  No, but I go back to my degree in first aid.
I didn't enjoy giving mouth to mouth resuscitation
but you have to do it when in fact it's needed to be done.
I tell you what I applied, I applied the hospitality side.
I applied the part of being front of house, customer service...
You're faced with fight or flight in any situation.
Fight, flight.
I disagree with you entirely.
If I was a flighter, I wouldn't be here now, would I?
Let me tell you why I should still be in this process.
I don't honestly care what anyone else thinks apart from what you think,
because I believe that actions speak louder than words.
There is a reason why I'm the strongest salesperson in this process.
There is a reason why I have won two tasks I've PM'd on.
Jim so far has managed two and lost both. I'm incredibly creative...
You've certainly got a lot of self confidence, that I give you.
Lord Sugar, beside you at either side you have people who can say, he's honest, passionate, he gives
everything he can, everything possibly, talk about box of tricks, I can do it all.
I can do sales, I can negotiate, I can pitch, I can break records
in terms of orders from massive retailers.
I'll go along with you on the talking.
Oh my God, if there was an award for talking, boy, you would be up there.
Right at the top.
It's a very, very difficult decision that I have to make now
because you have come through 11 weeks of gruelling pressure.
But I do have to make a decision.
Jim...
You have this kind of manner, and some people might call it charisma, of getting people on your side and
controlling the situation, which is a good trait sometimes in business but it has its downfall also.
Susan... You don't seem to get on too well with people.
That may be because you're very determined and don't take any prisoners.
But anybody I go into business with, I've got to be able to work with.
Natasha...
I can't reconcile some of the things that have happened today.
You started off like a house on fire but I have found you a little lacklustre in the last few weeks.
Susan...
There's not many people that have got a good word to say for you.
But you have achieved quite a bit in putting yourself through school
and all that stuff and you've run a business.
Susan...
You're in the final.
Jim, I like your spirit.
I do like your spirit, Jim.
You're in the final.
  Natasha, you're fired.
  Much appreciated. Thank you.
You two, you've done very well over the past 11 weeks.
I'll be in touch with you shortly and let you know what we're going to do
to decide who's going to come into business with me.
  OK, off you go.
  Thank you, Lord Sugar.
I mean, the process is tough and if you can't at hack it then obviously, that is a weakness.
It shows me that perhaps that person's got no chance of being a business partner of mine.
In this process, some of the characters will
scream and shout and fight and I'm not willing to lose my dignity.
I've walked out of this process with my head held high.
No hard feelings. Whatever happens in the boardroom, happens in the boardroom, stays there.
You smelt blood and thought this is your time to scalp Jim, so you give my name.
You did not answer that honestly.
What I said in the boardroom was true.
  That is how I feel.
  If we had it decided on business acumen, I would've picked you.
Because your business acumen's been really poor.
I've more business acumen than, well, I suppose you and Natasha
because of the fact that I started my own business.
  Three!
  Oh my God, is it just you?
  Oh my God, congratulations. Are you OK?
  Yes, final three!
Did anybody order a final four?
  I can't believe you!
In the fight to become Lord Sugar's business partner, four candidates remain.
Next time...
Now it's time for you to convince me that you're worthy of becoming my business partner.
Time to hand over business plans.
If you don't know your own business plan then you're in trouble.
  But when the final four are grilled...
  What's the business?
You haven't got one error. It's full of errors.
I've got a pretty good radar for bullshit and this smells like bullshit.
What impression does that give me of you? That you're a bit of an ass?
Three go up in smoke...
You're fired. You're fired.
..and one gets the money.
You are going to become my business partner. You're hired.
