Wow, gosh. Hello, and welcome to the show.
Well, I don't know if you can feel it at home, people,
but the atmosphere in the studio tonight is bloody electric.
I don't know what it is, but there's a real sexy energy in the room.
Is it me?
Is it the sleeveless cardigan?
I mean, I suppose it is a cheeky little number, but...
Thank you very much.
By the way, Russell Brand is here.
  I don't know if you've noticed.
  Russell Brand.
  Thank you.
  Thanks for coming.
  Thank you for your introduction.
That's very kind of you.
And on his team tonight.
After a string of LA meetings, she finally broke Hollywood.
And while it's being repaired, she's doing Strictly Come Dancing.
It's former S Clubber Rachel Stevens.
And, would you like your comedian famous or really tall?
Preferably both, but we'll settle for really tall. It's 6ft 8 comedian Greg Davis.
And on Phill's team tonight,
He refuses to become commercial, famous or successful. It's Sway.
And, he went to Eton but he hasn't been eaten,
because he's usually the one doing the eating.
It's the winner of this year's worst introduction, Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall.
Those are the teams. Let's now say something that must lead to applause,
even if I specifically say, "Don't applaud now."
So, we begin with Don't You Know Who I Am? Phill, Sway and Hugh, watch this.
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume...
  OK, standby to shriek, Barbra.
  ..Memory time...
That's perfect. Big eyes now, Celine.
Bigger eyes, Barbra. That's it! And now pretend to like each other.
That's wonderful. And we're clear. Thanks, everyone. That was hideous.
Tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes...
That was Barbra Streisand featuring Celine Dion with Tell Him.
But what does Streisand demand whenever she performs?
Is it A, all her mirrors must be slightly convex?
B, rose petals must be strewn in her toilet bowl?
Or C, everybody has to call her Madame Babsy?
You're referring here of course to the ludicrous contractual demands
made by many artistes upon taking an engagement, Simon, yes?
Yes. What does Streisand want?
  Sway, have you got any?
  Yeah, I've got a rider but it's proper simple.
  Right.
  It's only like nuts.
As in peanuts, and you know, hazelnuts, them kind of nuts.
What else? Oh yeah, honey and lemon and hot water.
You know, the funny thing about getting honey and lemon is that they always forget to put the knife.
And being a rapper and that, I don't really want to ask for it, cos you know?
Do you gig, Hugh? Do you do live shows?
Do you know, I did do three dishes from one goose
live once in Wimborne theatre.
They still talk about it.
Now, Hugh, the first time I became aware of you
was when you did that TV dinners programme, and you ate a baby.
No, I didn't quite eat a whole baby, but I did have a taste of placenta, yes.
The placenta? Just the placenta? So, what did you do with the baby?
The baby was fine, you know? It was just the placenta.
You didn't lightly marinade it and put it in the freezer?
I made the placenta into a pate
because it's much easier to share with everyone rather than giving around pieces.
Have you ever got halfway through a placenta and realised you forgot to take the baby out?
More recently you were concerned about battery farming chickens.
  That's right, yeah.
  So you care about the animals living well before they die?
But, this face, to me ...
Let's ignore what it says up there.
But this face, to me, isn't the face of a man saying,
"I hope he was comfortable in his life."
  I'm still looking after it, even as I walk through that door.
  And where are you going in that door?
  It's like your own special little room where you touch your meat.
There's something about you that makes me think, you know,
to write this book, it is a really big book about meat.
It makes me think you're a bit perverted.
What do you do when you go home?
Do you sort of strip off and cover yourself in raw gammon?
I've never felt myself up with my own meat, if that's what you're...
But thanks for the suggestion.
Anyway, Barbra Streisand.
What was it she wanted?
A) All her mirrors must be slightly convex.
  That doesn't work.
  No.
  Because?
Well, because she already looks like...
If she wanted all the mirrors to be convex, it would be like looking into the back of a spoon
and it would make her look even more like Barbra Streisand.
She might have wanted them to be concave, because then she'd look normal.
These words like "normal", she'd look more normal.
I'm sensing a sort of anti Semitic theme coming from this.
  Have you ever cooked a Jew?
All mirrors slightly convex, rose petals in the toilet,
  or everyone calling her Madame Babsy?
  I think petals.
  Hugh says petals. Sway says?
  Petals.
  Phill says?
  Petals.
Let's see if you're right.
  You are correct.
You're right. The answer is B   the singer is said to insist on staff
scattering rose petals in her bathroom as well as supplying peach toilet roll to match her complexion.
However, this story did come from the Daily Mail.
If they'd had it their way, Barbra would never have been born.
OK, Russell, Rachel and Greg, look at this.
Ooh, I saw her She walked in through the out door
Out door She wore a raspberry...
He's got tight trousers, big hair and an overwhelming sexual potency  
just like one of our panel tonight, eh?
  Hugh?
You sexy pork rump.
So, that was Prince with Raspberry Beret.
What did he reportedly demand when he played at the O2 Arena last year?
Was it A, a five bedroom house to be built in the grounds of the venue?
B, a special chair in the wings for Jamie Theakston?
  Or C, all women to wear name tags?
  Rachel, you're a pop star yourself.
So, these seemingly unreasonable demands made by Prince,
which of them seems to be the most likely?
I've often asked for Jamie Theakston to come to my dressing room, but it's never quite happened.
  That's a given for me.
  I think so.
  I won't go in any dressing room that ain't got Jamie Theakston in it.
  I think it's wrong.
  Well, what's the point? How can you relax?
Greg, have you any views on this topic?
I think it's without question...
  God, you're handsome.
  Thank you.
You've got something. Blimey, I felt an urge. OK.
That's all right, I'll look at Rachel.
There we are, back to normal.
You're kind of like Prince, in many ways.
I'm amazed that he's got career because it seems to me that he's...
I think he's an undeniably talented man, as are you.
  Ah, nice.
  But I just think that he's constantly wanting to hoof something 24 hours a day.
He wants to pounce on something.
And I think that him and Theakston would be an amazing and unusual pulling team.
I think he uses Theakston as a distraction.
You cannot use Theakston as a distraction!
He's a man in his own right with feelings and urges and lust and dreams.
He is.
But he's an amiable ex TV presenter with a winning smile, and he distracts the ladies.
  And then Prince...?
  Pounces.
So, hold on a minute. You can play the part of a lady.
I'll play Theakston. You play...
  Prince.
  You're Prince in this set up   because of your enormity you've been comically miscast.
  Good morning, are you all right? Nice to...
  Yeah, right!
Prince! AND
Come over here, come over here!
Greg, your morale is too high. Help, Simon!
  No, he's so big.
  This is coercive now.
Because Rachel wasn't complicit in that.
So sorry, are you OK?
  Yeah, just having a slight wardrobe malfunction.
  Very much.
I did see some of your body parts then.
  Did you?
  And I still respect you as a sex object.
Right, I think we've learned an awful lot then.
Never trust Greg in a sketch.
What's the matter, Greg?
I don't think life's going to get any better than ten seconds ago.
  Let's wrap it up.
  What, when you fell on Rachel Stevens?
I didn't fall on her, I made love to her.
  You must be kind to Rachel Stevens and not hurt her tonight because of the dancing.
  No.
Let's talk about Strictly Come Dancing for a second. How's it going? You'll probably win, right?
I'm absolutely loving it.
You could become the new Alesha Dixon.
You know, anything could happen, right? Or Mark Ramprakash, you could be the new Mark...
OK, Simon, I'm going to step in here.
Part of my duties as team captain is to protect the members of my team.
You compared them to people, I don't know what any of it meant,
  but I'm pretty sure it was cheeky. Now, are you all right?
  Thank you, Russell, yes.
I will stick up for you in any given situation,
although I don't want to become an impotent assistant to a big lumbering rapist.
Any situation, I'm here for you.
I don't think this is about you being some sort of hero, saving Rachel.
It's just so you can say, "Look what I did for you", so you can do all your sex business on her later.
  You cynical man!
  Rachel, are you OK?
  I'm OK.
Well let's talk about Strictly in a nice, sort of GMTV type way.
  Is it going well?
  I must protest!
  What?
That was sarcastic!
  Against GMTV!
  GMTV is a fine institution.
Only because you've got books to sign and you'll go fucking anywhere to do it!
On Strictly Come Dancing, they said your dancing was excellent but that you were holding something back.
  Really?
  Can I suggest it's Simon Fuller's fault, the evil mastermind behind S Club?
His sort of media training has meant you've been fearful of
giving all of yourself in moments like this, when you're dancing.
That's very analytical of you.
Because when I interviewed you on Popworld, we did a silly pop interview
and I asked Rachel what her favourite nut was, and I think you said cashew.
  Yeah.
  I said, "Oh, cashew". And then you went, "Hang on, dry roasted".
  And I said, "Pick one of those"...
  It's very important.
Ad you wouldn't pick one of the nuts, for fear of offending one of the nuts.
Why not, tonight, pick a nut?
  Oh, I don't know, I couldn't.
  She still can't do it!
I must protest. You are pushing Miss Stevens too hard on the nuts.
  It's all just words, no one will get hurt.
  That's true.
But when Rachel gets home, because of you she'll have to check for lice.
  I resent that.
  OK, so what was the point?
It's outrageous demands from Prince.
Well, we don't know, actually, is the simple answer.
Did he have a house built in the grounds of the O2?
It seems unlikely. Did he have Theakston in the wings? Impossible.
  Or, what's the other one?
  Name tags on women.
That's sexist, I won't have that.
Especially not when a simple colour coded sticker system is just as good.
It's Theakston, isn't it?
He probably met Theakston, done an interview
and got on with Theakston, because he's affable, and he went, "I want Theakston in the wings".
And you have chosen to make a mockery of that.
No one's mocking Theakston!
Good, do you reckon it's Theakston?
  I concur, yes.
  Theakston?
  Theakston?
We're all saying Theakston.
It's not Theakston. So, er, you're wrong.
The answer is A. According to reports, Prince wanted a house built next to the venue
for his 21 gigs and any future trips to London.
Although this story did come from the Daily Mail,
and if they'd had it their way, Prince would never have been born.
Right, next up it's the West End smash Intros Round.
Phill and Sway, here are yours for Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall.
Have a good time, Sway. Good luck, Hugh.
Dow da dow da da da Dow dow dow dow
Dow da dow da da da Dow da da dow
Eh eh.
I'm not there yet, keep going.
It's the introduction   if I do any more then there's words.
I definitely, definitely know the song, but I just can't remember.
I'm passing it over to Russell's team, a chance to steal.
OK, well, of course we would never knowingly steal, but we're happy to participate in your quiz show.
Greg said something interesting earlier.
  What was it?
  I believe it to be the '80s classic Footloose, by the coiffeured Kenny Loggins.
You're bloody right, here's how it should have sounded.
Hugh, is it true you always carry a pork chop in your pocket?
And occasionally you sniff your fingers to keep you in the mood?
  No.
  No? It must be another chef.
  Sorry, I've got to...
  No, no, stand up, sing a song.
No, I have to sit down, I'm getting a food boner.
Go on, sing another song.
  Good luck.
Diddle iddle iddle i Kerching!
I can do this one!
Dum dum de dum dum
Dum dum dum dum
  Dum dum de dum dum
  Kerching!
Dum dum dum dum
  Dum dum de dum dum
  Kerching!
Dum dum dum dum
  Dum dum de dum dum
  Kerching!
  Got it.
  He's got it.
  Money, Pink Floyd.
  Is correct, here's how it should have sounded.
Feels a bit boring, doing jokes into an autocue with you sat there.
  Don't worry, commit to it, you'll be great.
  Mm.
Show your vulnerability and your beauty, the autocue will love you.
So, that was money...
By Pink Floyd.
Very good. Bravo!
Why not?
Why not have a song by Pink Floyd, lovely.
Pink Floyd's hit, Another Brick In the Wall, features children singing "We don't need no education"  
a sentiment some contributors said they disagree with. Similarly...
We caught up with one of St Winifred's School Choir,
who said her grandma could go fuck herself
  Well done, mate.
  It was better.
Nice.
Right, Russell and Rachel, here are yours for Greg Davies.
  We're a bit nervous about this, Rachel and I.
  What, the songs?
Yeah, when Rachel and I discussed how we were to do this,
Rachel very much put the onus on me,
a man with no musical abilities or experience.
  She's just tapping on the table.
  Similar to what she did in S Club.
  She was the best one!
  She was the best one.
I would never have joined the S Club were it not for her.
  You don't know what it was.
  Yes, I do, it's like Scouts or Cubs.
God I love you!
We can do this damned quiz.
  It's only a quiz, isn't it?
  Goddammit!
Nothing serious can happen because of a quiz.
"There was a quiz earlier, three men died!"
It's a quiz!
Right, OK, Rachel.
Ti ki te ti ki te ti ki te!
Dun! Dun! Dun!
Dun! Dun! Dun! Dun!
Dun! Dun! Dun! Dun! Dun!
Dn dun dn dun dn nn
Dn dun dn dun dun nn...
Now it would end there, but I'm going to carry on to help you.
Dn dun dn...
But it is just going to be that, a lot more times.
  Any ideas, Greg?
  Yes.
  Go on.
For two reasons   one, it was very good, and secondly, I read it.
Oh, no!
Greg! Why!
I would have known it anyway, so where does that leave us point wise?
  We might have to abandon the whole point system.
  Oh, Christ!
  Well done, the point system's gone!
  But he knew it!
You can have the point, but we'll donate it to a school.
Yeah. I'd prefer that.
OK? So, go on, what is it?
  It's Kasabian.
  With?
Shoot The Runner.
  Is correct!
  That is the correct answer.
Here's how it should have sounded.
It's nice to see Rachel singing again.
We've seen you dancing recently, now singing again.
Now what happened? Because we saw all those pictures of you
  a year or two ago, going to meetings in LA.
  I did have lots of meetings.
  You're doing Strictly Come Dancing.
  Yeah.
  You're above it now.
When you're dancing, do you not feel, "I could be in LA having meetings"?
No, I think I've done my meetings for now.
Did anybody in these meetings ever ask you for your favourite nut?
  Funnily enough, no.
  You're so beautiful, Rachel Stevens.
There's no need for you to sing, dance or do anything.
It's just enough for you to just stand there, bored.
Right, that's it! You've crossed a line there!
  I said she was bored, not me, although I am.
  Simon!
Last song.
Dow now now now now now
Cchhhhhhhhhhh!
Dow now now now now now
Ahhh!
Tsh! Tsh!
Dun... Dun...
This is just to help you.
  Dow now now now now now!
  Oh, God!
Dum dum dum dum dum dum...
That's taking advantage of the situation.
That was the sounds we were making.
Can I see some of the moves again, maybe?
Not with the sounds.
Oh, my God!
Ee! Ee! Ee!
Brrp!
I've no idea what the song is, whatsoever.
I'm going to pass it over.
  Don't pass it over, Simon.
  No? I'm going to pass it back.
It's been passed round everywhere, this poor thing.
I'm going to tell you what it was.
It was Numb by Linkin Park, here's how it should have sounded.
  I think we practised that, and that.
  Now, Russell?
  Yes, dear?
  We're like, friends? We're friends?
  Yes, we're actually friends.
We used to be on that stand up circuit together?
  Stand up circuit, together.
  You could describe us as contemporaries.
Well, yes, you could do that.
Oh. You're going to use my book against me.
Some of the stand ups among my contemporaries
who I particularly admire are  
Daniel Kitson, Ross Noble, Paul Foot, Simon Munnery and Stewart Lee.
All excellent comics.
It's all right. Maybe I'm in the television bit.
On the telly, I love The Mighty Boosh and Garth Marenghi.
  No! Hold on!
  That's it? Two opportunities to mention me?
  I won't have that.
  Didn't you like Popworld?
It was very, very entertaining.
  You did very, very well hurting those people's feelings.
  Yeah.
So that was Numb by Linkin Park.
We also heard Shoot The Runner by Kasabian.
Tom from Kasabian has called Pete Doherty a tramp
and Justin Timberlake a midget with whiskers.
Who does he think he is?
Slagging off pop stars all day from his comfy chair while his own work visibly deteriorates?
What a loser.
OK, round three is the identity parade.
Phill, Sway and Hugh, what about some dance stuff?
For the audience only, here is Shena singing The Weekend.
I'm going to blow it all away
Blow, blow, blow
I can't wait
For the weekend to begin
I can't wait
For the weekend to begin...
So that was Shena with Michael Gray with The Weekend.
But which of our line up is the singer Shena?
Is number one Shena?
Number two, Ayrton Shena?
Number three, little accident with the henna?
Number four, Monarch of the Glena?
Or number five, are you sniffing your porky fingers againa?
  Any ideas, Phill's team?
  Sway?
  Sway?
I think it could possibly be the first one.
  Yep.
  She keeps staring at us.
Yeah...
If it was spot the hypnotist round, I'd be right with you.
  Number two was tapping her feet.
  You're thinking what?
I was thinking maybe she remembered singing the song.
You're like the third biggest chef in the country, right?
  That's very kind of you.
  You're in the top three.
Thank you so much.
You beat Gary Rhodes. He's over now. He's on Strictly Come Dancing. No offence.
Channel 4 did a sort of ethical food season and got you together
  with Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay. What was that like?
  It was good.
Are you too posh to be fully loved by the British public?
They see Jamie Oliver and think cockney boy done good.
Gordon Ramsay's all sweary, like a bricklayer.
But you just seem like a toff who wants to have sex with chickens.
Well, you may have put your finger on it, Simon.
What can we do about that? Sway, any advice to Hugh?
Just... My album, it's out now.
..LP, you know what I mean?
Which woman is the singer Shena?
I'm leaning towards number two with Hugh.
I guess I'm going to have to go for number two as well then.
  You're going for number two?
  Think so.
  Let's find out. Would the real Shena please step forward.
  Yay!
Number four!
With a new album out in February, Shena, ladies and gentlemen!
Imagine that. To have Shena here.
Wow!
What happens to them now?
They die.
And the bodies?
Russell, Rachel and Greg, how about some shouty indie music?
For the audience only, here is Bis.
Oh oh, kandy pop
Sugar sugar, kandy pop
Push it down, pull it up
Sugar sugar, kandy pop
Just don't let the music stop
Sugar sugar, kandy pop
Push it down, pull it up
Sugar sugar, kandy pop
Just don't let the music stop.
OK, that was Bis with their single Kandy Pop.
Which of our line up is singer Manda Rin?
Is number one Manda Rin?
Number two, Manda Holden?
Number three, Manda Holyfield?
Number four, Manda lifeboat, skipper?
Or number five, Manda write these crappy jokes?
  We must decide which one we believe was in Bis.
  Yes.
  That's a simple matter.
  Do you remember Bis?
Er, well, no. As a matter of fact, I'm completely oblivious to it.
You could say ignorance is Bis.
Is it that one, that one or that one? It could be any of them.
Normally when picking a woman, I don't bother with this hullabaloo.
You can boil it down to a simple gesture.
But today we're on our best manners.
I like that one, she's got a quiff.
That one looks cute and rosy. She's all sort of innocent.
That one's filth. I'd go for that one most likely.
The one with the bullet belt, shotgun. Pa pow! Let's go!
  No need to pick one. You can have all five.
  Yeah!
Greg, have you got any observations?
My feeling is it's number three, I have a great respect for her  
she winced at the notion of having sex with you.
Which is number three? I like a challenge.
Number two, I just really want to cuddle you.
Now when Greg says cuddle...
No, cuddle.
I just want to hold her.
  Rachel, what do you think?
  Good.
But I think that's my job. Rachel, what do you think?
Go on, Rachel Stevens.
Can you pick one?
Can you do it?
Can Rachel Stevens make a decision?
  No!
  I'm going to go...
I'm going to go number four, I think. Scarily.
Rachel Stevens has turned a new page.
I've come a long way, Simon.
  There's a great difference between picking people and nuts. Any fool knows that.
  Exactly.
  Blimey.
  Do you still see the other S Club people?
No, I don't, actually.
Yeah, fuck 'em. Yeah.
I can't remember why I'm here.
You came over here to beleaguer Rachel.
  Now let's just pick one. Who do you think it is, Rachel?
  Two.
  Shall we go with Rachel? She's prettier.
  Yes, two.
If it's not two, the world can go hang.
OK, I'll tell you.
  Shit, now I think it's one.
  Rachel!
You see what I had to deal with!
Yes. It must have been hell! What's your favourite nut?
  Oh, for.... A cashew, all right?
  Cashew!
My word!
  We're on a winning streak.
  Yes!
  A winning streak.
Pick one, pick one. You can do anything now.
  I've picked one.
  You changed it though, love.
  Four or one?
  One. You're right.
  Going with one?
  Yeah!
  Let's see if you're right.
Would the real Manda Rin please step forward?
Two!
No. There is no God!
Now promoting a new solo album, Manda Rin, ladies and gentlemen.
So we end with next lines.
  Russell's team get to go first.
  Great.
  Your time begins now. I am an antichrist.
  I am an anarchist.
Is correct. The Sex Pistols.
What's our function? We continue saying what you're saying
and then guess what it was? Is that what it is?
  All I'm seeing now is a man with cards and sounds.
  Russell?
  Yes, dear.
Is your anarchic wit trying to destroy this panel show?
No. I'm definitely part of it and I want it to succeed.
  Because this is all I've got, this show, OK?
  You're brilliant.
  Thanks.
Tina's doing her dance.
  Oh!
  Jon's looking for rom ahnce.
Yes. S Club Party.
Paul's getting down on the floor.
While Hannah's screaming out for more.
This is good. If you keep asking ones that she's sung, we're a shoo in.
Want to see Bradley swing?
Want to see Rachel do her thing?
Yeah! S Club. What was Rachel's thing?
Nut selection. We've all seen that.
  Well, this is good news for you.
  Is it?
  You've got ten points.
  Brilliant.
You have got two points.
You need nine to win. Your time begins now.
Eezer Goode, Eezer Goode.
  He's Ebeneezer Goode.
  Is correct. The Shamen. He ain't heavy.
  He's my brother.
  Correct. The Hollies.
  Like a bat out of hell.
  I'll be gone when the morning comes.
Correct. Meat Loaf. Because of meat!
  Old MacDonald had a farm.
No, and on that farm he had a special room where he cuddled his meat.
  OK, well, you know, it was close.
  We had less time.
  You had less time?
  No, no.
  You've been cheating for them all night.
I don't know what to say to you.
Sorry would be a start.
So, the final scores, Phill's team have seven points. Russell's team have ten points.
We've won?
Thanks to Phill, Sway and Hugh, Russell, Rachel and Greg.
Join us next week when James Corden will be the guest team captain
and I'm thinking about wearing a cardigan that will bring out my eyes.
Goodnight, everybody!
Little placenta there.
