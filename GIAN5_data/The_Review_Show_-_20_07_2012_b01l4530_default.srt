On the review show tonight, the East End of London. Seen through
the lens of one of its most famous sons, David Bailey. I hate all
the architecture of the Olympic Park. Four new films commissioned
to mark the Olympics. And reverse. Into our cow.
And other highlights of the London 2012 festival. 10 million
opportunities to see 12,000 events and performances, but to what
extent is there something for everyone.
Lining up on the starting blocks are the writer and critic, Morley
more, author and historian, Bettany Hughes, and Dreda Say Mitchell. The
photographer David Bailey was born and brought up in London's East End,
it is right his exhibition should be in the Royal Docks, as part of
the capital's CREATE festival. David Bailey's east en, encompass  
  East End, encompasses the change in the area. Looking at three
decades in his career. Using unseen images from his vast collection.
How did this exhibition come out, what motivated and prompted it?
have been working on a book about the East End three or four years
before. There will be three volumes, the 60s, the 80 and the present day.
   the 80 and the present day. Some how, I think somebody contacted
somebody, at Boris's office, they showed me this compresser house,
they said the lighting is pretty awful, but I quite like that
lighting and all the reflections in pictures, it gives it another depth.
What about the pictures from the early 60s, they are very surprising,
I have never seen that body of your work? Visually for me the 60s are
emotional, they are more somebody searching. I'm searching. I love
the loneliness of them. I notice there is always a lonely figure, it
sort of, I remember the East End, especially around Stepney and Brick
Lane, having a lonely feeling. It was always seemingly raining.
the 80s, what is the thing there? Cold, I become very technically
cute, and knew, you know, you kind of take the cubic path. The 80s
ones are my German pictures, they are all on expensive lens and tilts.
And then in the last five years? They are more, then I didn't know
what to do. I only use digital for street or snaps, it is, the digital
cameras don't have attitudes, they take a similar picture. I have
watch my mates use digital and they look at it and say they have got t
you never have got T because it is on digital you see it and think you
have. On film you don't ever think you have it, you go a bit further.
The whole exhibition is your relationship to a particular place,
or an area? Or a person. Do you feel, still, distinctly connected
to that part of London, that is now becoming the Olympic site? First of
all, I don't think it is taking over the whole of the East End,
there is plenty of it left. The East End gets pushed and pushed, it
will end up in France if it is not careful. Or Holland. It keeps going
east. They should have gone west, if they were smart arses, that is
the way it end went. Does it make you nostalgic? No, I hate nostalgia,
it is awful, it is, I can't think, I hate all those old farts that
want to talk about the 60s, and notth's gone, it is done, there is
a few snaps of it left, let's move on. Now it is the most interesting
moment we are ever going to have, isn't it?
I think it probably is, in that philosophical sense, Paul Morley.
There is plenty of new work in this exhibition, were you surprised or
did it reinforce what you expected him to do? I have always known away
from the image of Bailey he's great photographer. It great to see the
sense of the now of the 60s, that was his now, he was in his element,
it is this energy, and a craving of these people he captures, some more
famous than others. It tell us how this is both an exhibition about
Bailey's growth and the East End of London, and the parts are well done.
The tremendous sense of him discovering himself in the 60s. In
the 80s, as he says, there is a coldness about it, he's using it as
a back drop. The East End has gone into stasis, it is dropping off the
edge of the planet. It is almost beyond him when it goes digital.
You realise the great analog period is over in many sorts of ways, and
that energy and depth and life of the 60s has become ghostly he is
not sentimental about t he's still looking and finding things.
Equipment isn't helping him. There is a brittleness about it    the
equipment isn't helping him, there is a brittleness about it, that is
clear to the times. These are historical documents, is there a
timelessness, does Bailey manage to transcend his time, or is he always
emphatically seeming to produce it? He is of his time, that is why he's
such a brilliant photographer. So interesting to hear him talking
about the 60s, and not being nostalgic about the 60s, he's so
right, I'm sick of hearing about the swinging 60s, for those who
lived in the decade the party was happening somewhere else, and you
were on your own in a street in Stepney or Hackney. Or in Ronnie
Kray's pub, which was firebombed moments after he took those photos
there. If you look at some of the photos from 1961, you would say
they were blilts photos, these are bombed and devastated streets. He
has such tenderness for them. It takes place in the compressor
building that was an old refrigerator. Without being too coy
about it, the warmth out of the exhibition is enormous, he loved
the taking of the photos, he loved the selecting, very few photos, not
man in there at all. I get the sense he's being very involved in
the way they have been mounted. I know he has, we were talking to the
attendant, he said they made them find a tape producer for the labels,
and they had to get one from the 60s. I love that he has said he
doesn't like old farts getting nostalgic about the 60s, what about,
then, the present in Bailey's work, what about the more recent
photographs in particular, you live and work in the East End. Is this
your East End, or does it chime with Bailey's East End? Which
picture really struck me, from the 1960s, and I think what he does is
very complex, it is the one in Spitalfields that we have shown,
with the church in the background, I used to be a brownie at a
neighbouring church down the road. What you have in that picture is
not just a sense in the foreground of the wreckage of an Industrial
Society, but you have that fabulous church that, even the shape of it,
the tallness of it, you have got a real sense of prosperity and grand
do you remember of the industrial age. So you have these two ages,
that he snaps in this one shot. I tell you what I found out about the
80s that was interesting. I lived in Docklands, I lived in Wapping
for years, the pictures of his wife, I tell you what, I think sometimes
what I would have liked is this sense that the Docklands and the
warehouses, now people have stopped working in them, now they are
living in them. I would have liked some pictures of people living in
the warehouses, because I think sometimes we get this impression
that the 80s in the East End was a dead time, it wasn't actually at
all. It is about the idea of dwelling slightly on the 60s, now
we are beorning to work out what was going on    beginning to work
out what was going on there, we are asking the questions and disregard
them. And the idea that people were trying to piece together a new
world, and sourcing their own sense of freedom, I think Bailey's trying
to find his freedom. In the programme today it is interesting
to see an unmonitored sense of people away from constantly being
caught out and looked at. Bailey is capturing something that was rare
to capture. Now, most images are constant, ever present. You get
something really rare about the past that transcends being just
nostalgic, you are not looking at it to say the good old days, but
you are seeing a real energy, and the complexity of the photographs,
the sense of the overwhelming nature of history, to an extent had
fallen apart. And people with real, boisterous energy, like Bailey,
starting to piece it back together. For me, he really gets into the
whole of the East End, when people go into East London, particularly
now, if you see films, it is gritty, tough, poor and downtrodden, if you
look at the pictures in the club, they are suited and booted, the
people in the club have their cufflinks on. It was a real thing
you had to make yourself look good. Baileyesque almost, it is a big
thing in communities. That is a nice thing to end it on, we are
setting up what the future and the East End is now, not just suited
and boot, but clad in high tech. For the moment, David Bailey's,
East End runs in the Royal Docks until August, there is a longer
verse of the interslew on the website. Some of Bailey's    on the
interviews on the website. One of the stated aims of the London 2012
Olympics was to transform and regenerate a neglected area of the
city. The results are visible in the Olympic Park, containing eight
new venues, alongside Britain's tallest work of art, and a 4,000
square metres megastore. Beijing's centre piece was the
bird's nest, it was always going to be hard act to follow. London's bid
for the 2012 Olympics took a different approach, these are the
sustainable games, where function trumps form, and buildings are
lauded for their green credentials. The main stadium fits the bill. A
straight forward structure praised for the use of low carbon concrete,
and the removal is up a teir, making it more viable. The
velodrome has made an affectionate nickname, the pringle. The exterior
echoing the shape of the track outside, has won many fans. It has
been likened to a Stradivarius. The Aquatic Centre, with the wave like
roof, with highboards, and has secured approval from architects
and swimmers alike. Other notable new venues are made to the
sustainable brief, a reuseful basketball arena, and the copper
box, set to become a community sports centre. The stand out
structure is the Orbit, it is said to be inspired by the Tower of
Babel, but it is more akin to a giant Helter Skelter. As the
tallest tower in Britain, it comes with impressive views and a high
price tag. Will it become the legacy of London 2012.
How did these buildings measure up as landmarks, to previous Olympic
landmarks? I think we are judging them a bit too soon, nothing is
bedded in yet. When you go to the Olympic Park it is like a fun fair
ride, you are arrive on the DLR or the cable car, it feels like an
adventure. It is a really mixed bag. Definitely, the Pringle wins out
over the volume will you vent, and none match up to the bird's nest.
We can develop our new Cockney rhyming slang with all the names we
give them. I have been underwhelmed by the buildings, apart from the
velodrome, which is equisitely beautiful. It looks like what we
are getting right, is it is called an Olympic Park, and for good
reason, there is a goodment amount of green space. I want to see as
the park develops and matures. Space as much as structure? I have
seen quite a lot of this being built, in the car as we drive by
the Olympic stadium, and the velodrome. I have to say, like
Bettany, I'm underwhelmed by it all. I don't hear people talking about
it, not in the way people are talking about the Shard, you either
like it or you don't, but people are talking about it. I remember
when the Arsenal stadium of being built, did people talk about that.
Only Arsenal fans? No, everyone talked about it. I have to say, in
terms of talking about this new architecture, I'm a believer in why
not use what we had already, like they did in 1948, very localised
games, very successful. The athletes came into accommodation
now that was there. And also that venues that were there. I don't
know why we spent all this money. You want a Poundland Olympics, more
appropriate to the high streets as they are. I want something that
focuses on the Olympics, individuals and their talents and
what they can do. Looking at the building and space, this was billed,
if not the "Austerity Games" of 1948, one of the selling points
that Sebastian Coe made to the Olympic Committee, is he would
leave the Olympics in a more sustainable state, in terms of
structures and buildings. Does that chime with you, have they succeeded
in that? It has redrawn my map of East London, therefore, it might
redraw the map of East London to a large extent. When you see the
street down Bethnal Green, it looks like a distressed rollercoaster,
close it is something else. There is a sense of inside an enclosed
space, what has happened is a Balardic construct, an other place,
the need for the British to present the Olympics in their own way, and
the history of the Olympics has created a sub totalitarian bubble,
where suddenly the Olympic rings have the feeling of a totalitarian
logo. Something sinister has joined in, not the joyfulness of the rings
replaced by that. The rings remind me when you had the hypermarkets at
the edge of down. They are monuments to capitalism, who are
these monuments to? To a few people's egos, within it is a
wonderful thing. One or two architects have responded to the
freedom of the brief to create wonderful things that no one else
has allowed them to do. temporary is an interesting thing,
funnily enough, sculpture in the public domain has become temporary,
but in the Olympic Park it is permanent. I want to say to you,
Paul, I think you are being a bit harsh on it, I think, actually,
there is an permanence there. There is tempity stuff coming away. But
there is a character of London that you can't beat down. We have too
deep roots to destroy. That the fact you have the beautiful
buildings, but still, muddy old Bow Creek is surging around the corner.
You were saying that, about the energy and character of the people,
it doesn't represent this kind of London, it is droplets of something
else. If you talk to local people, there is a real disconnect with
those buildings. I think it is what you are saying, Paul, it seems to
be happening over there. That may change when the Olympic Park is
opened? And the long term. They look like carcasses already.
that edifying and optimistic note, we will end that. We will move.
love sport! We will move into the creative domain. The Olympics may
not have started yet, but we have almost reached the end of the
fourth year of the Cultural Olympiad. According to the
organisers more than 16 million people have taken part in or
attended performance in the largest cultural celebration in the history
of the modern Olympics. If you feel it has passed you buy, don't worry,
the London 2012 festival is in full swing. As the Cultural Olympiad
races towards the finish line, the arts baton is passed to the 2012
festival. An all encompassing programme, bringing together
artists from all over the world. The festival deserves a gold medal
for the sheer scale of programming. You may have attended an exhibition
It's clearly enormous, does that size reflect ambition and
achievement for you? It does, I think if you are going to have a
party, have a big one. I think it does, I think if you're having an
Olympics that is looking at humour, endurance and achievement, why not
have cultural events as well. What I love about what we are doing with
this festival is we are drawing in artists, I believe, from all the
countries taking part in the Olympic. What we are doing is
putting British achievement, cultural achievement, in the
context of world achievement. I just think it is fantastic. We are
also having everything from the Proms, to Tate Modern exhibitions,
to various projects that may have exists any wa, but is the 2012
Festival a good idea, because it gains a momentum and gives a sense
of something much larger? There is an obligation to the shadowy
figures that run the International Olympic Committee that this must be
done. Sorry to be all Albert Steptoe, I love art and sport, I
think there is a cultural obligation. The closer you get to
that, and things squeezed in to being sporty, and inclusive, and in
the long run it is anti democratic, it gets cold. I get the feeling if
you have been to some things and didn't know you were the Olympiad,
you would have come across fantastic things. As soon as it
gets close to that bloody logo it starts to shiver into the corporate
world that is slightly underwomening. The ambition and
idea of sell    underwomening, the ambition and the idea of selling it,
it is not all the bleeding obvious. A lot of the mainstream celebration
and cermonial aspect of the Olympics is the bleeding obvious,
it is great to get things around the edge that are not. Does it
matter the Olympiad cultural festival? David Bailey is not part
of the festival, and part of CREATE. The art is great as long as the
audiences are right. There were interesting kids in the David
Bailey, I have been to the events and it is your standard public, it
doesn't seem to be anybody new coming to appreciate the art.
go deeper into the art, in particular, we have seen the
festival is nothing if not diverse, the film strnd is small t includes
   strand is small, it includes four of our known directors and two
new ones. From the director of the acclaimed documentary, Senna,
coming The Oddyssey. It is a mixture of aerial footage, Olympic
archive, and interviews with unnamed Londoners, recalling the
excitement of the announcement of the games in 2005, and reflecting
the troubles since. It celebrate the inspirational power of sports,
and asks, if London, in spite of recent difficulties, can bounce
back. Lifetimes of stuff has happened, since that joyous
screaming day in Trafalgar Square, but it is still London.
It probably is still the greatest city in the world. Mike Leigh's A
Running Jump, is fast paced comedy about an all singing and diving car
salesman, desperate to nail a sale. Shimmy on in and take a test flight.
You can drive this with chopsticks and wash it on a Saturday night.
Away you go. Leight's film also reflects the importance of sport in
people's lives. From armchair punditry, to the teaching of
aerobics and yoga. And reverse, into your cow.
Set on a London council estate, What If, by the street dancing
directing duo, draws on Rudyard Kipling's people If, a guardian
angel guides a young boy through his troubles. Your's it is earth
and everything in it. And which is more, there will be   
you will a man, my son. Swimmer is Lynn Ramsey's poetic
interpretation following a swimmer through Britain's waterways, lakes,
rivers and urban canals. Intended as a showcase of Britain's finest
director, these show radically different interpretations of a wide
brief. Do they represent the best of British film making talent?
How was the balance for you, both of the directors chosen and the
films produced? It was a great balance. You have a very quirky,
fast moving film with Mike Leigh, A Running Jump, then you have the
documentary, that is great, I loved that. You get such an aerial vision,
The Oddyssey, then you get the Swimmer, which to me was a lot more
abstract. It was the one I didn't connect with. I could see people
connecting with it, it is absolutely beautiful. The favourite
one for me was What If, it made me for the first time like brutalist
architecture, I absolutely ait hate that. But they use it to show sport
really well. And the nod to the Paralympics with the baseball
player in the baseball court in a wheelchair. The basketball player?
None of them feel like films that would have been commissioned by a
tourist board, maybe that was never going to happen. But they give, to
a certain extent, warts and all view of Britain, with the
exceptional of Swimmer, much more poetic? I wouldn't argue with you,
The Oddyssey could be given to the tourist board, beautiful aerial
shots. It has the financial crisis? Then you go back to the wonderful
sunset across the Shard. They are an eclectic mix, I love the Lynn
scam Ramsey, completely abstract and it seems to be the most about  
  Lynn Ramsey, completely abstract and it seems to be the most about
London. It is waters all around us and the swimming is part. As a
historian you must have liked it? There was a Famous Five theme tune
to it, she enjoyed making it, you could see that. I love films, there
was the thing that happens, I hate to come back to it, it is the sense
of obligation. Here it is, we have to dot films now. In that sense,
Mike Leigh's was the most honest because it was so slap dash and
thrown away, it was like a weak sitcom F he was the Woody Allen, it
was the film that would be his worst. The Lynn Ramsey and the What
If, and The Oddyssey, they are interesting, they have a sense of
whistfulness and bleakness, honest in a different sort of way. I like
the idea that The Oddyssey could be a travel log film, it could be
selling London to the rest of the world. There is a thing that Jeremy
Hunter wants us to move up from the legal tables of most visited
countries, from sixth to fifth. I guess that is what it is about, it
is what are these films saying about London at the moment a l they
achieve it. The Ramsey one, looking back to a postoral Britain, a
psycadelic Britain, in black and white, is maybe what will bring
people. To an extent The Oddyssey as well, the sense that London is
an anxious and tough place, and it represents that really well. But
also with a rather British sentimental quality as well. Just
to say, it is a shame, I think, as you said it is the best of British
making film talent, but not the best films they have ever made.
should be, we are going to watch athletes in that. Jo what is the
brief, who is in charge? I found it difficult, it needs that thing that
at the moment that is so out of fashion, which maybe Danny Boyle
will deliver, which is one voice, not this inclusive thing. We don't
live We don't live in a country of one voice. You need one in control.
That is the problem, it was interesting, this year I went to
see John Carlos, one of the Olympiads from 1968, with the Black
Power salute, which he said wasn't Black Power, he was talking about
what we allow to happen to ourselves, is we allow people to
choose our icons, that is kind of almost your modern one voice, that
everyone filters through, I don't think it is like that. I think we
can have many voices and pathway, that is what I liked about the
films, it gave us an eclectic range of forces. Choosing Noel Clarke as
our icon. What is wrong with him? That delivery of "If". It was great.
No, no, no. They felt slightly committeeised. There were still six
executive producers. And the sport was squeezed in. The sport was the
overarching thing, you think that was tokenistic. What is it saying,
an unexpected sporting moment, not planned and not an ad telling us
what will happen, will light up the Olympic Games. At the moment there
is so much ordering and organising of how we should respond, and even
this art is doing that. I think they have enabled art is a terrible
thing. You want the one voice. missing something and focus, its a
committee, the committee is the voice. The wider committee, once
you start to get inclusive is the voice. That won't lead it a good
place, this called Blue Peter inclusiveness. As tkhair of the
committee I will stop this    as chair of the committee, I will stop
this. Unlike this sofa here, actually BBC Two and Channel 4 have
collaberated on this proebgtj, all films will be shown    project, all
films will be shown next week. In an attempt to cover as much ground
as possible, we have split the panel up and sent them to report on
different events. Bettany, you first, you went to the Royal Opera
House, to see a collaboration that involved ballet, choreographer,
dancers, artists and a robot? robot who is a goddess. It wasn't
entirely coincidental, there is an ancient historic theme to this,
that is why I leapt at the chance to see it. There is a lot of names,
I went to see Titian 2012, there is also Metamorphosis, at the national
gall hery they are responses to this extraordinary group of peoples,
in particular the story of Diana and Acteon, the cheeky hunter, who
spies on her, turns into a stag, and eaten by his own hounds.
Chris Ofili, responding to Titian, and in turn they have worked with
the Royal Ballet. Let's see the Plenty of Metamorphosis there, did
it do justice to its origins? I loved the ambition of the project,
I loved the fact it could have gone so spectacularly wrong, you have so
many people involved, it short circuited you back to the
brilliance, and beyond that to the primal, prehistoric roots of the
games themselves, like the sanctuary of Artimis, a spiritual,
dark, dangerous place, Trespass, gets you straight there. It
succeeds on every level. It is at the Royal Ballet, but there is an
exhibition at the national gallery and there is a book. Something more
temporary, you were in Stratford at the royal theatre in Stratford, you
weren't inside, what were you doing? This is a collaboration
between the theatre Royal, strat    Theatre Royal, and an Australian
company, it is an award winning production, called On Route, you
turn up in a designated space outside, someone sends you to
someone else, you get a set of headphones and an MP3 player, and
lots of interactive instructions, envelopes on walls, messages own
walls, tracks telling you where to go. You start wandering in spaces
you wouldn't usually wander. It is a fantastic example of psycho 
geography. The idea is people in urban dwellings are meant to send
off their beaten track. I ended up in spot and spaces. I know
Stratford well, that I would never end up in. Let's see where you did
end up. If I told you a loved and hated the city. Loved and hated the
way it surprises me, the way it changes, transforms. If I told you
I loved this city. Loved and hated the way it takes me with it,
absorbs me. Love the way it surprises me. Would you believe me?
Take a photo, now, take a photo. Licensed graffiti there. I loved it.
Did you feel vulnerable, did you feel you were being taken to place
you didn't necessarily want to go? Definitely, for example, there were
a couple of stairwells, if I had been on my own, I had somebody with
me, I wouldn't have actually gone up. I know the theatre company they
were monitoring and making sure you were safe. But as a woman, every
now and then, I thought, if I was doing this on my own, he wouldn't
go to certain spaces. But, you knew somebody was looking after you. So
it was great in that sense, because you were then able to enter spaces
you wouldn't go to. Theatre tends to be, obviously we're isolated
individuals, but we experience it communally, this seemed to be a
more isolated experience, of that strong? What they wanted to do was
to make it a solitary experience, for somebody to do on their own of
the I'm not that kind of person, I want somebody with me, I had
somebody with me, every now and then I could flip the ear phones of
and ask what you think and what will you write on the wall.
Something very nice happens to you at the end, which I won't tell
anybody about. People can experience it for themselves. Paul,
had you the monumental job of experiencing as many of the 20,
2012 commissions for music, 12  minute slots each. They have been
played in various place all over the country. For the first time
they were all performed over the same weekend at the Southbank
Can you not stop running Stop running
So how was it for you? Just wandering into spaces you never
usually wander, that is the function of this kind of music,
contemporary music. I love music, what is interesting about that is
the idea that some of this contemporary music will be some of
the most marginalised alleyways of modern culture, to an extent. It is
often the distance is down ununusual alleyways, it is an
opportunity for them to get some attention. Within that you kind of
think, there has to be 20, and they have to be 12 minutes each, they
didn't have to have a sporting theme, but everybody did do them.
There is lots of lines on the stage. That was a frame for people to kick
against? It is interesting, it workeded in a number of ways. The
opera, in 12 minutes it is a tremendous opera. It gave us an
opportunity to come across someone like Graham Phikin, one of the
great composers in the country, no  one will know his name. Even though
he's squashed into being one of the 20, you get a sighting of someone
who needs more exposure. That was a real success. People wandering off
the streets too, because they were free. People sit down and coming
across different forms of music, way outside the Gary Barlow end of
things. And being excited, seeing different levels of fantasy, noise,
ways of expressing themselves. Even though the thing had that thing
that I love music, but the relay, it is a marathon, I think this was
a tremendous example of how a focus over things released over a year or
two suddenly came into one place, and really gave a meaning about
other places to listen to, that are usually covered up. Instead of the
idea about Olympics and the Cultural Olympiad being about
legacy in terms of monument or works of art that will last, I get
the impression from you all that the strongest things are
experimental, and are only with now, and what happens in the future are
not a concern of the those creating them? It is interesting that it
needs something like this to give access and space to the tremendous
nature of what is at the heart of this, one of the most central parts
of our soul, which is experimentation. But the corporate
world, of course, continue, and tries to undermine it, because it
is ideolgical, they want to control that, because it leads to the sort
of freedom they wouldn't like, and we would all be complaining about
the totalitarian logo. The legacy is the moment when your mind is
open to something new. That is the thing. And we share it. I think it
is the connections people make, dare I use the word "inclusive"
connections people make. We may have agreement breaking out. We
will end with historical precedence, the arts and Olympics have a long
shared history, a long time ago, artists were up for medals
alongside the athletes. The revival of the Olympics came down it a
Frenchman. Art was just as important to his vision as sport.
He wanted the event to unite the muscles and the mind.
Beginning with the stock Millennium Dome games of 1912, art med   
Stockholm games in 1912, art medals were given out in 12 catagories,
sculpture, music, literature and art. They had to relate to sport in
some way. Works have been submitted from all over the world. This group
in plaster from Sweden has won a first prize. He himself won the
literature measure, with his Ode to Even athletes got in on the act,
several wins medals for sports and art.
Bartok, Ravel and Stravinsky sat on the music board, but were so
unimpressed they didn't award a single medal. Few Olympic artists
are remembered today. After 1948 art medals were dropped in favour
of exhibitions and festivals. If art medals had survived, who would
be on the podium this year? Bettany, is this an hissoral idea
to be resurrected in further    an historic idea to be r resurrected?
It was Mark Wenlock who reinvented the Olympic Games, and had medals
for embroidery. I think we should have medals for the unsung heros. I
would like to see a medal for a group that have revived
cultural achievement in the Cultural Olympiad? Dr D, Rufus N
Norris, a beautiful collaboration with David Albarn. The great and
the good getting your medals? a man of the street. I don't agree
they should be brought back. Because I think it is the Olympics,
and it should be a focus on sports, I used to do sports when I was
younger, I would love it see that continue. In the spirit of my crass
question, who would win the medal for you. I wouldn't choose anyone,
I have an issue with the question, my issue is, I often think awards
don't get to vote, really, we would be choosing the great and the good.
