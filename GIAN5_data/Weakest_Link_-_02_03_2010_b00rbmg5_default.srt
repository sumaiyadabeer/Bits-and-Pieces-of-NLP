  Is that the showbiz factor?
  Hmm. A bit of fashion.
  And the hair?
  Pretty funky?
  Er...untidy.

  What do you do, Gareth?
  I'm a box office manager.
  Where?
  Prince of Wales Theatre. Mamma Mia.
  Always wanted to work in show business?
  I trained as an actor.
  So it must be a huge disappointment to be locked in the box office.
  No, it's quite a heavy dance show.
  Can you not dance?
  I can look like I can dance, but I can't dance.
  Do you look like you can sing, but you can't sing?
  No, I can sing.
