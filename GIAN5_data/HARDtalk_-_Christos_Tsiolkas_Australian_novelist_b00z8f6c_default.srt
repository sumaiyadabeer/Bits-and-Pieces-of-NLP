agreed it was time to advance a political process. In many ways
Australians have never had it so good. This economy is booming but
is it a country at ease with itself? Well, not according to my
guest today, the Australian novelist Cristos Chalkes. His book
direction modern Australia has Welcome. A pleasure thank you.
Australia was once dubbed the lucky country but in your fiction it
seems like the unhappy country. Is that fair? I'm hesitating because
for me it is a bizarre place, Australia. You know, we are doing
this interview still in the middle of the global financial crisis when
I was in Europe last year I was in Greece so I saw the real effects of
what that crisis means, the insecurity and anxiety that comes
from that. So you look at a country like Australia which has been
sheltered from that crisis because of a whole entry kit history of
politics to do with our relationship with Asia so we are
the wealthiest we have service ever been. Australians have never had it
so good the early? When I started to write The Shraipt was trying to
make sense of to things happening. One I come from a particular
background which I'm really proud of but in writing in being educated
I just feel like I'm no longer   I can no longer claim a right to a
working class background that my parents come from. Because they
were working class immigrants from Greece? Yes, part of that massive
immigration that came to Australia Post World War II from southern and
eastern Europe. So I'm very conscious of that heritage and how
my fortune is the dependent on the personal history of my parents but
I was aware that impart of the middle class, you know. I had not
really in my previous work dealt with what that meant. Because that
is what I picked up from the book and from some of the other writings
that I have seen of yours. You seem to be uncomfortable with the
middle class you have entered. One phrase that stuck in my mind from
you, you talk about the crevicees and the dark spaces of the
Australian suburban landscape. Australians tell ourselves we are
larrikins that she will be right mate that we are accepting and over
the '90s and the early part of the 21st century I thought we were the
most selfish that I have ever seen. We are the most grasping and greedy
and xenophobic and unkind that we have ever been. I think it is very
true. These are the people you life among. I resist the idea of that
being part of a people, many part af nation is that you cannot see
yourself clearly. Growing up in a migrant household there was also
the romance of a place called Greece and a place called Europe
you are a part of and I could escape to that. It put two or three
years of a visit to Europe to put that at rest. I wanted to really
have a look at who we are, what we have been doing, what we have
become and that is where The Slap emerged from, that is what I wanted
to write. I think it the is a harsh thing to say but not untrue. I love
reading contemporary fiction and I read a lot of it, but I do not
think I have ever come across a book where so many of the voices
through whom the story is developed and told are so utterly unlikeible,
even despicable. A lot of people have said that about the characters
in the book. I do not think that. I certainly do not think that about
the old man in the book. Yeah, he... He is the Greek father of one of
the main characters. He himself appears quite a lot but it is
really his son who is the central person. Yes, in the book. But he
has, yes, incredibly sexist attitudes. Most of the men in the
book are mosogonist? I would say one of the things about being a man
in the culture is being aware of the your slide into mosogony, of  
it is not only on a level of making sexist comments or assumptions, it
is actually fear or hatreds of women. Having to be conscious of
that. The violence in the book and a lot of the sex is written as some
critics have said in quite a pornographic way. Was that
deliberate? Yeah. I was really surprised by the poverty of a lot
of that criticism. I was really surprised they would not
acknowledge that porn ago if I is one of the ways    porn   I can not
avoid porn, it is on the internet, on the screens, it has infected   I
use that word   the way I look at sex. The Slap is not isolated from
my other work I said from the beginning and maybe that has to do
with with being homosexual and growing p in a culture like this.
So on the one hand a very traditional Greek culture where it
felt, it just felt impossible to be a faggo t to be really blunt.
you are honest that is the way your own father and family would have
viewed a homosexual, as a fag not? Yes. I remember coming    faggot.
Yes, I remember coming out to Mum on the cusp of my 20s, and I had
been living away if home for a while an she just was trying to
understand why I had cult myself off from the family    cut. And I
had to turn to her and say "Look, I'm gay" but I did not know the
Greek word for gay and she did not know what the word gay meant back
there so I had to say I was a fag. That was the only language hi for
it. In saying that I do not   you know, I think my parents have made
remarkable journey as I V I think there is great dignity an courage
in their unrelenting support for me, but there was no way   I did not
understand how to be a man and be gay. It just didn't make sense to
me. That was a long struggle. Did you think it is because you are a
gay Australian that you are able to take a particular maybe a more
detached view of what is going on with the majority of Australian
hetrosexual man hood? Because of my sexuality and I'm talking 25 years
ago, because of my sexuality and because of being, you know, to be
blunt a wag in this culture, an outsider in this culture. That gave
me an outsider perspective an insider outsider perspective and I
think that is extremely valuable for a writer. You said to me I am
wo g. What on earth do you mean by that? That was the derogatory term.
Even though they were olive skinned immigrants from the Mediterranean?
Yes. You have to understand that there is for a long time in this
country   and I was born at a time when it had not gone away   there
was a white Australia policy. Australia was going to one, we were
going to deny a racial history built on the history of the
Indigenous people here. That is one of the things why race politics
continues to be so difficult and confronting for Australia, as we
still have not resolved that in any meaningful way. I look across to
New Zealand u I'm not trying to be romantic about it but they have a
better relationship between Indigenous and non Indigenous.
Kevin Rudd's government issued the formal apology, you talk to young
Australians on the streets and they will say that it feels different
now. This government has recommitted itself to a specific
multicultural strategy for this country. It has. Just now after a
long period of making the word "Multicultural" a very, very dirty
word by parties, by the Liberal and the Labor parties in Australia had
straight away. I just want to be clear   are you suggesting, and it
feeds into my original question about your view of Australia,
whether it is an angry and unhappy country? Are you saying that
Australia today is still dogged by racism? Think Australia is still
dogged by fear of the other and racism, yes. I think your country
is, Stan. I know Greece is. I mean, you know, what was the major thing
I heard from Greeks when I was over there? The fear of the immigrant.
The difference is that Greece obviously is an ancient culture
with an ancient tradition. Britain is a pretty old established culture
too. This is a country built by immigrants. In a way it is more of
a paradox for an outsider, a stranger for you to sit before me
in Sydney saying "This country is dogged by racism when it is full of
immigrants". Everybody has come from somewhere except when it is
the Aboriginal community. I   think it is a contradiction because
it is real. I will be more harsh about Australia because I live
there and it is a place I will die so I want to stake my claim in this
country. As a man living here, um, I have my own observations to make
about other places in the world. Um, but I do fear that racism is a side,
as I said before, that we have not felt properly in this country.
it is a tough place to be inside your own country and because you
have said because of your sexuality and your ethnicity to be an
outsider from the very get go and then to be so public in your
critique of the way society works? It makes you very lonely, isolated?
I do not feel like that at all. I feel I'm more part of my life, I
have such a solid relationship, such a solid family, such a solid
network of friends. So I think maybe that gives you a certain
freedom to express things. I think it is important to keep demanding
of Australians that we get better and get better at dealing with our
racial and immigrant history. One, because, yes, you talk the people
on the streets and you say that we are better at dealing with
Aboriginal people and Aboriginal history. Yes, Kevin Rudd made the
apology and I was at the Aboriginal Advancement League in Melbourne
when that apology was made and I will never forget that day and how
important and moving it was. But the reality is on the ground
Aboriginal people are dying much younger than we white Australians
are dying. They are still living in unbelievible squalor and poverty.
Those things have not changed. I was just coming to the sense of
view I was reading that over half   they were doing a poll and over
half of the population of Sydney express racism against Muslims and
they do not want Muslims to come into the country. So things have
changed. Things always do change. I think there was a slide backwards F
you had spoken to me in the early '90s I would have been much more
buoyant about this country called Australia. I come back from Europe.
Thank God I'm here. At that time Europe to me was a nothing in lots
of ways it still is obsessed with class in a way we do not have it
here. That is probably one of the things I do really like about this
country. But I thought that yes, we were multicultural, I thought we
were an immigrant nation that was proud of that heritage. Then in 15
years that all evaporated or that is what it seemed like to me and
that its what I wanted to write about. It is a way where your book
overlaps with current reality because what we see in the
Australian political debate is that race has become absolutely the most
heated, divisive issue the plate call agenda and on the right wing
of Australian politics we have shadow Cabinet ministers railing
against government tax dollars being used to pay for the funerals
of those people killed in the Christmas Island boat smash. We
have other figures in. The Opposition Coalition saying Islam
is a totalitarian ideology. Do you worry about what you are hearing
right now in the political debate? Just the other week when there were
the images of the refugees burying their dead and then I heard, you
know, a Liberal politician saying that we should not be paying to fly
those people to the funeral. And you know what, I felt such a
disgust and hatreds for a moment for this country. I just wanted to
be out of here. Maybe growing up in the shadow of racism means that I'm
just   maybe I'm overly aware of it. Maybe I'm too quick to see it. That
is possible. It think that is possible,    I think that is
possible. But I really will the fight that moment of hatreds. I
really had to fight saying I am disgusted with my country. I don't
want to live in that feeling because that is the only place I
have. I cannot go back the geese or Europe. What about reception for
the book which has been termed by the ABC the main broadcaster, state
broadcaster in Australia, has been turned into an eight part
television fiction, sold enormously well. What kind of reaction has it
prompted in this country? One of the things I'm really conscious of
is a sense of relief that someone is describing an urban Australia
that actually looks and sounds like Australia, the Australia we live in,
not some kind of fantasy of London or New York or Paris, that is
Australian, that you know, Australians are people like me. Um,
I think that partly explains, not completely, but partly explains
some of the success of the book. I think there is a relief. The book
describes a new middle class that is as much Greek as it is Scottish,
that is as much Lebanese as it is English, that is as much Chinese as
Welsh. I think that is the reality of the world I do move in.
Melbourne almost feels like a country in itself sometimes. Like I
feel quite comfortable in Melbourne. And maybe I think there are spaces
in Australia which are that old Australia. And I think some of the
resentment that has been expressed about the book, about some of the
anger expressed about that book has to do with the fact that old
Australia does not recognise itself enough. I make no apologise for
that. Do you want to reach out to that old Australia? Do you want to
reach out to them, to find a way of communicating in with them?
would be an amazing hubris really to think that I can do that. What
gives me pleasure is writing so that's what I'm going to dofplt and
if I have any effect it come only come through the writing. I mean a
lot of people read The Slap and think it is really vulgar. I mean
I'm not interested in these people. And what I'm hoping is that there
will be some audience out there that will respond to the honesty in
the book. It strikes me that the two characters who are most decent,
who offer the most hope in your book, are the to youngest main
characters, the teenagers, Connie and Richie. Is that because you
invest for this country itself, a huge amount of hope in the coming
generation? Is that where you see Australia's best hope? In the main
I see   I do get hope from seeing how young kids interrelate with one
another, that they take a multicultural, multi ethnic life
for granted and they live it on a street level, on a home level, on a
friendship level, on a love level in a way that I think was not
possible for me in my generation. That in short is the Australia you
want to believe in? Right. They all have a my generation self respect
that is something I respect about the a generation younger than
myself. Are you writing new fiction about contemporary Australia?
in the middle of a novel. Touch wood, her you talk about   I would
be an idiot to   I would be an idiot to complain about the success.
It is that little dream that I have had for so long. I thought you were
going to say something negative about success? Just that you can
get quite busy! I mean, I have been writing for a long time now and I
wanted to do. It took me a long time to start this next novel
because I was scared. I was scared about what were my   what were my
motives, you know? Was this a book I wanted to write because I wanted
to write this book or was it because I wanted to follow The
Slap? Suddenly I had a blueprint for a best seller. To put it
bluntly, your first book haves not sold terribly well. Some people
have loved them but they have not sold very well. Suddenly you have a
best seller that goes international. And I wonder if there is a part of
you that says "I have to repeat that I have to get the sales even
higher, I could become a major international literary figure"?
must have heard this. There are moments when row sit at the desk
writing and you think "My God, I'm genius, I'm up there. No one is
writing like this!" and then just as often you think "I'm going to be
revealed for the fraud I am any moment now". The next book is about
a swimmer who fails in his Olympic dream and part of that is because I
want to deal with those questions of failure and success. Is there a
fear that you might be the writer who strives, has some success, then
fails? Yes, of course there is. Of course there is. That will go away.
I doubt it ever goes away for anyone no matter how successful
