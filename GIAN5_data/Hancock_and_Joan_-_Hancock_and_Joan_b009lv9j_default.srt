Do you want to die, Mr Hancock?
Do you want to die, Mr Hancock?
This programme contains very strong language.
You drank a bottle of brandy in five minutes. And then passed out in front of your mother.
It's a game, isn't it?
Not any more, no.
I've drawn a diagram. Your liver.
I've shaded the swelling.
I shouldn't give up the day job.
We're going to have to put you back on Plurentavite.
I'd like to try and avoid sedation this time...
'20 million of us each week tune into the angry pompous little man
'in the black coat and Homburg hat. The Lad himself, Tony Hancock.'
Your Lad from East Cheam was one of television's richest creations,
yet since you shrugged him off, you've never stopped giving yourself these convulsive remoulds.
I'm not remoulding myself, I've just got older.
With the East Cheam thing,
we found a serious identity which
was potent and then...
We got bored with it.
Well, at least I did.
And that's when you split with Sid James?
One has to move on.
We all did, I think.
And you've had a sort of mish mash of emotions in public recently.
Your divorce and remarriage and separation and psychiatric help,
along with your weight problem and drink problem.
How has your career been affected?
  I don't think it's been affected at all.
With all this, you've been called
"the master of the self inflicted wound."
That's not a bad phrase.
No, it's not a bad phrase.
Erm, whether it's accurate or not is another thing.
Mr. Hancock.
Mr Le Mesurier to see you.
Johnny!
Thank you.
My dear chap. How are you?
They're letting me out later.
Freddie said you and she...
Another one up the Swannee.
Wives, eh? Who needs 'em?
If there's anything...
No, I'll be fine. Keep on the old straight and narrow till the show.
What exactly... is that thing?
Therapy.
Silly cunt.
Oh, Johnny!
Are you sure about this, Johnny?
Of course. Can't have you going back to that flat on your own tonight.
What about this new young wife of yours? She all right with this?
Rather a nice surprise, I should think.
  Lovely to meet you.
  God, yes. Er, sorry.
Honestly, Johnny. Look at me. I'm a complete mess.
You must eat.
Must I?
What about some more coffee? Got to keep the old arm working, I find.
Tell me about yourself, Joan.
You're a well guarded secret, I must say.
  Where did the old boy find you?
  I was working at the Establishment.
Oh, the club?
Did you meet Cook? Arrogant bastard.
All above my head, of course.
The other one. He can play a bit.
Dudley? He's lovely.
The little one with the club foot.
That was one of the first times John and I clicked. Dudley asked me to request a song.
I asked for What's New?
  Did you now?
  And John said...
  What did you say?
  Oh, no...
"How does a slip of a girl like you know an old song like that?"
Joanie, that is the most appalling impersonation.
At least, I hope it is.
Oh, this is better.
Oh, this is better!
Johnny, what was that?
He's fallen off the sofa.
No, leave him, darling.
That's the third time.
You love him, don't you?
It's difficult not to.
In spite of everything.
I love you, I know that.
I love you
more than somewhat, you know.
More than somewhat.
  Where are you from?
  Ramsgate.
  Ramsgate.
  Well, Oldham originally.
Ended up in Ramsgate.
  My father ran the carney.
  Carney?
Funfair.
The carney.
Never heard that.
I love words, don't you?
They're like stars. In the sky. Don't you think?
A whole panoply of them.
You see? "Panoply".
There's another of the little buggers.
  Morning, Johnny.
  My dear chap. How are you?
Being royally taken care of.
  Looking togged up.
  Er, Paris?
David Niven?
Spy film. I think I may have mentioned it last night.
Ah, the old brain cells, Johnny.
Few more lost in battle, I'm afraid.
Er, are we, er?
Joan's coming to the airport.
She's seeing me off.
Oh, don't mind me. I'll let myself out.
Can we go and see him? Tony, in this Festival Hall thing?
I'd like to see him now I've met him.
If you like. Taxi.
He's so...
He's like a big sad teddy bear, isn't he?
I shall miss you, my dear friend.
I'm an alco...holic, you know.
So tell me about your son.
You told me earlier you had a son from your first marriage.
  Does he live here?
  He lives with my parents in Ramsgate.
We get to see him at weekends.
  It's not ideal, but...
  What is?
  Do you like children?
  As long as you can give them back at the end of the day.
So who was he? This husband.
An actor.
Good looking sexy so and so, I suppose.
He was, actually.
  Bastard.
  That too.
No. He wasn't at all.
  So you like the bad boys then, do you?
  Who doesn't?
  At first.
  Well, not Johnny, surely.
Ah you see, you sleep with the bastards.
You don't marry them.
Can I tell you something?
I am absolutely shitting myself.
This Festival Hall thing.
Could be the end of me.
I spoke to my agent earlier.
He's booking me into the clinic for the rest of the week.
Keep me on the straight and narrow.
I hate it.
Place gives me the creeps.
You wouldn't come with me, would you?
To the clinic.
Just see me off. Just, just get me settled.
I'd, I'd ask Johnny if he were here.
Would you?
That's him.
Very discreet.
Good evening, Mr. Hancock. Welcome back. Ready?
You won't leave me alone, will you?
  It's true what they've been saying in the papers, then?
  What?
Well, that he's a bit of a piss artist.
It's not like that.
Oh? What is it like, then?
Hello?
Yes, it is. Yes, that's right.
Well, I'm not sure. That's very late.
And my husband's...
Of course.
It's easier for him to rehearse at night.
Less chance of press and all that.
Just needs a friendly face out there, I think.
Bit dreamy with all those drugs they pump into him.
But I expect you know that.
How's dear old John?
  In Paris, actually.
  Is he?
Thank you.
That's your cue, Tony.
Kenny'll stop when you hit the mark.
Tony, Kenny'll...
  Shall we try some of the new stuff, Tony?
  Joanie? Is that you?
I think that'll do for tonight, boys, don't you?
Do you remember Sid Field? The best, bloody genius. I'm not fit to lick his boots.
You're so hard on yourself.
You're a genius too. Everyone thinks so.
When they repeated the Hancocks last year...
We watched them...
I just thought... is this it?
Earl's Court, East Cheam?
Is that all there is?
Please, God, don't let it be.
Don't let me be trapped in that forever.
And now where am I?
Is this any better?
Christ.
Nothing's good enough, you see? Nothing's funny.
I could murder a drink.
God, what a boring load of old rubbish.
Let's have more about you.
You come from Oldham. You moved south when you were a kid.
Your old man ran the carney in Ramsgate.
You've got a little boy you worship.
And you like bad boy sexy actors.
Not necessarily...
And you've got the dirtiest, sexiest laugh I've ever heard.
You know, you're not how I thought you'd be at all.
You really listen.
Well, you have to listen, don't you?
You have to watch. I mean it's not me that's funny, it's other people who are funny.
Not me. Other people who are interesting.
  You just have to listen.
  Yes you do.
Now we're both listening and that's never going to work, is it?
Sit here in silence like that.
All we'll hear is the chef pissing in the soup.
I do love that laugh. Stop it. You'll get me.
I can't do it to him.
I love him too much.
What about me?
I don't know.
I think you do.
It's different.
How different?
We'll just have to see each other when we can.
I don't know... I'm sure we can do that.
Of course we can't do that.
He's not a fool.
He'll know the minute he claps eyes on us.
  I'll tell him.
  No.
  If you won't, I will.
You can't.
That would be awful.
Let's just wait.
I can't wait for you.
It just happened. I don't know how.
I didn't... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Of all people.
If it had been anyone else...
I should have known.
It's my fault. Should have seen.
There was nothing for you to see.
No, I should have.
  Where is he now?
  He's booked into the Mayfair.
Of course. He always does that.
When he's under the cosh.
Will you go there?
  I can't leave you like this.
  No
No, I shall be fine.
Blimey.
Hello.
Could I have a number in Baron's Court. 4530.
Hello? Johnny. It's me.
Oh, Christ, I'm so sorry.
'I love you, Johnny.
'It just happened.'
  I know.
  Oh, God, Johnny...
I'm sorry.
Hold on Johnny, the door.
I called. I couldn't bear it.
I've been up half the night.
Johnny.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling, he called.
It's all right.
This must be awful for you.
Oh, Johnny. It's all fine.
  I'll be all right.
  'Call me if you need anything.'
Yes, I will.
Love you.
I love you.
God, you look wonderful.
Do I?
Come here.
< Tony?
Just coming!
  Who is it?
  Don't panic.
It's only my mother.
Christ, Lil.
Come in, you pick your bloody moments.
Just coming indeed.
What do you think, Lil?
  Isn't she gorgeous?
  Hello, dear.
Right, you old witch.
Glass of bubbly?
So, that was another school we had to take him out of.
So unhappy. Weren't you, ducky?
Never let me grow up, have you, Lil?
I remember we were out on a drive once and we saw a train
in the distance and she turned to me and said,
"Ooh, look at the choo choo puff puff."
What's wrong with that?
I was 32 at the time.
My two favourite women in the world.
Bloody marvellous.
I can face anything now.
Oh, Christ...
Tony?
Tony?
No, no! Don't, don't come in!
No, don't listen!
It's all right.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh!
How can you bear it?
Oh, I can bear it.
Farts and all.
I can't do this.
What am I doing?
Christ, what's happening?
My arse has exploded and my teeth are chattering.
Why are my teeth chattering, Joanie?
When I was living in Ramsgate, my friend, Sheila, worked on the dog track.
She said, "When you see the dogs on parade before the race..."
HE TURNS RADIO OFF "..if one of them has a hard on or has just had a crap,
"put your money on it."
I'd back you on both counts tonight.
Come on. This'll calm you down.
Let's just get through this show, eh?
And then you can stop all this.
We can go away somewhere, by the sea. Ramsgate.
You can meet David, my son.
He'll love you.
We can make you better. Look after you.
It'll be just us.
  Can we do that?
  Um, of course we can.
Can we though?
Shh!
Good luck.
Mr Hancock.
  You doing the new act, Mr Hancock?
  Yes, I shall be running through the card tonight,
  and then straight down the dole first thing tomorrow.
  This way, Mr Hancock.
He'll be all right.
If you'd been through this as many times as I have...
Come on.
Come on.
Get out there.
Come on, walk!
Come on!
Come on! This is it!
Come on, you wanker!
Good evening.
I don't think I've ever seen such an ornate garage.
And good evening to you in the big dipper.
I was told this place was acoustically perfect.
If you can't hear, shout out.
In any case, I expected a battery of microphones.
This show's going out to all nations,
and by early bird to my mother in Bournemouth.
Always bothers me when there's an audience behind you.
Seems to attract a... funny kind of person.
  Can you tell us your plans for the future, Mr Hancock?
  Yes. Ramsgate for the fishing.
  Why Ramsgate?
  None of your fucking business, dear boy!
  Was it all right?
  It was wonderful. They loved you.
Went back to the old act. Was that all right?
  Of course it was all right.
  They stood up at the end.
Couldn't wait to get out, I shouldn't wonder.
Those boys hate me.
Rehearsed for weeks and never got beyond the first page.
Was it no good?
Don't know. I never read it.
Perfect.
Come on.
Ah!
LAUGHING Tony, stop it!
Um, we've come about the flat.
Is he ill?
If he needs the toilet, it's on the landing.
Gentlemen are requested to lift the seat and stand well forward.
Quite spacious. Lovely view.
Oh, yes, extensive vista to the harbour and thence to the channel beyond.
No telephone?
  There's a box on the corner.
  That suits us just fine.
People like to leave the telephone at home when they take a Ramsgate leisure break.
You're him, aren't you?
  Am I?
  Off the telly.
Well, um...
  You look thinner.
  Oh, I am thinner.
  Your face.
  Er, well...
  Cheeks.
  Well, as you say.
You were funnier fatter. Kitchen is through this way.
Sell it? Sell the Caddy?
Something a bit more subtle, apparently, George.
A Merc. Get a Merc. And keep this lot under your hat.
I don't want the press sniffing around down here.
I'll call you if I need you. Right now, I'm on my honeymoon.
  Come on, woman, up them stairs.
  Don't you dare.
Hello, Dad.
  Dad, this is Tony. Tony, Fred.
  Hello, Fred.
Got the glasses ready?
  Your Mum's sisters are down from Oldham.
  Both of them?
Mildred, Dorothy and Nellie, Aunties and Mum.
I knew you'd be gorgeous, if you produced this creature, but I wasn't banking on a bevy of siblings.
Not matching, I'm afraid. We don't stand on ceremony here.
Suits me down to the ground, Fred.
A proper family.
I can't tell you what a joy this is.
We've done some food. It's nothing very grand.
Before we start, I'd like to say something.
I can't say that we're not unhappy about John.
but we're not here to cast judgement on you.
You're both old enough to know what you're doing, how you feel,
so welcome to the family.
Thank you, Fred.
I'll take good care of her. You can count on that.
Right, come on, ladies.
I know you're fresh off the chuffer from oop north. Is there still trouble at t'mill?
Or have you lot finally sorted it out?
This is my darling boy.
  This is Tony, who I've been telling you about.
  Hello, matey.
  Why has he got a football under his coat?
  It's for you.
  What do you say?
  Are you trying to butter me up?
  David!
  Yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Will that do it?
Go on.
That's it.
Get it, take it off him!
Look at me.
That's it.
Ooh, be careful!
Watch me!
Ready?
Oh!
What is it, Dad?
Hello, Joanie.
I've been...
..worried about you.
I'm sorry, Johnny.
I should have contacted you.
  Well, how is he?
  He's fine.
Very happy. You probably don't want to hear that.
No, well, I love you both.
Oh, God, Johnny, this is awful.
You look so thin.
Oh, no, I needed to...lose a bit.
  How's the drinking?
  He doesn't need it now.
We can't stay where we are. The local paper's already onto him.
We're seeing somewhere tomorrow, by the coast.
I see the Beeb are broadcasting the Festival Hall show.
  You can't hide him away forever, Joanie.
  He doesn't need all that.
That was the problem.
He's been happy. He just needed a family.
Security. Love.
Yes. Well, you know that if...
Oh, God! What I mean is, if it doesn't all work...
I'm not going to fight, Joanie.
I know.
All right?
You?
The reptiles are out again.
I knew it was too good to last.
Now on BBC2, recorded live at the Festival Hall last month, an evening with comedian Tony Hancock.
Good evening.
I don't think I've ever seen such an ornate garage.
And good evening to you in the big dipper.
I was told this place was acoustically perfect.
If you can't hear, shout out.
I'm sick of drinking fucking tea.
Anyone bothers us here and they go over the cliff.
Isn't that wonderful?
I don't believe it.
Well, if it was that bad, why did they show it? I got a standing ovation, mate.
What else?
Did they? Don't give them this number.
Yes, all right, send me the ABC thing.
  I've just made some fresh coffee.
  I don't want coffee.
What's happening? Any feedback? Mum and Dad really enjoyed the show.
No. No feedback.
Something with ABC maybe.
And Freddie's lawyers have been on.
Be in all the papers, I suppose, soon.
Another divorce.
  And then this. This'll be next.
  What's the ABC thing?
Me as an MC of a nightclub called "Hancock's".
That must have taken some thinking up.
I'm sick of all these gags and routines.
Real comedy has to be about something.
It's got to get to the core!
  What about your idea, The Link, why don't you work on that?
  What's the use?
You could just stop, Tony.
Get out of all this.
Give yourself a life.
That's the whole point. This is my life.
I knew we should have kept away from the phone.
  You're still all right for tonight, aren't you?
  Why? What's happening?
The Lift. We liked that one.
With John, of course.
Oh, yes. Well...
  Darling, you haven't touched your food.
  Oh, darling, have I not?
Maybe I prefer the wine.
Now this is special.
Crozes Hermitage.
Light and fruity with a hint of blackberry.
  What are you laughing at?
  The wine talk. You're joking, aren't you?
No, I am not joking.
This is a very fine wine. If you can't appreciate it...
I think it's lovely. Has, um, has everyone finished?
Personally, I thought it was a shame when Sid James left.
  You and Sid...
  He did not leave.
I got rid of him.
You gotta throw out the rubbish. I'm not a double act.
It's not Laurel and Hardy, Jeeves and Wooster, Crosse and bloody Blackwell.
I don't need a sidekick.
Look at Chaplin. Look at Tati. Have you heard of Tati, Fred? French, like the wine.
  Tony...
  That's what they do, all of 'em. Ray and Alan. Ray and Alan.
"Oh, you so were much funnier when they were writing."
They got it all from me!
Probing my psyche.
I'm no one's dummy.
No one works me.
It's me. Up here.
I think we were only trying to say you and Sid were very funny together.
That, Nellie, is because you are a provincial Mancunian cunt.
  I think it's time we left.
  I'll get your things.
It's all right, mother, leave it. David.
  Go on. Hop it.
  David, come on.
Don't you ever speak to my parents like that again! Ever!
Fuck off.
Using that foul language to my mother!
In front of my son, a little boy!
Fucking little darling. Little mummy's boy.
  Might harden him up a bit.
  How dare you!
  Give it to me.
  No.
  Stupid bitch! Give it to me!
Give... Give it to me!
Give that to me! Give!
Oh, oh, oh.
Go on.
Hate this fucking place anyway!
Kent!
What am I fucking doing in Kent?
Kent, you're a cunt!
I do enjoy our little after dinner chats, don't you?
I'm not convinced you're entirely sure what it is you're taking on.
  I'm starting to get the picture.
  Are you?
Mr Hancock is a chronic alcoholic.
His drinking is out of control and has been now for some years.
Deserting him now isn't going to improve things, is it?
I feel you should be warned.
Mr Hancock's first wife tried to control his drinking.
Her method of helping him was to drink along with him,
but she herself is now, I'm afraid, also a chronic alcoholic.
  Mr Hancock's second wife...
  Doctor, I don't think you should be...
  Talking to you like this?
Under normal circumstances, no.
  But this is not normal, Miss...
  Mrs LeMesurier.
Mrs LeMesurier. This is dangerous.
Not only to him, although God knows he's been enough warnings, but also to you.
Mr Hancock's second wife was driven to such a state of despair she attempted suicide.
When can I see him?
  Did I hit the brandy?
  Do you not remember?
  The old infuriator.
  There was quite a lot before the brandy.
I've never seen you like that before.
You went on about yourself...
..in a different way. Almost bragging.
  Don't tell me, don't tell me.
  No, you have to know.
You, um...
you called my mum a c...
  Oh, God.
  I can't say it, I can't say the word. ..in front of David.
Christ!
I'm sorry.
I'm so...
Oh, don't tell me I hit someone, did I?
That was the coffee table.
  You were going to throw it through the window.
  I was? Why?
You seemed to have taken against Kent in a fairly big way.
I was throwing a coffee table at Kent?
In fact, you called Kent the same thing you called my mum.
I called Kent a cunt?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Help me.
Hey, ssh, ssh, ssh.
It's all right, I'm here.
But I think that might be it for Kent.
I told you it might be a bit Spartan.
Welcome to ABC studios. Give a big hand, please, to welcome the star of the show, Mr Tony Hancock.
Hello. Good evening.
Well, a right load of old rubbish we've got for you here tonight.
"All we get is some tired clowning, the well known turns of the recent poor years of Hancock.
"The mock Churchillian and the pseudo Shakespearean,
"Compere and stand up comic is his least effective role.
"Remembering his teamwork with Sid James, with those scripts by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson,
"it is extremely hard to see why he should continue in this particular form of suicide."
Guardian.
Fucking rag.
Let's eat in tonight, shall we?
I've got those steaks.
I could do a filet de boef. Would that be nice?
Yes, yes, that'd be lovely.
Yes, yes, yes.
Red meat.
Pink and juicy.
Yes.
You going to be all right, eh?
Do your slipper thing. That always keeps you still.
Yes, oh, I'm fine, yes.
Don't worry. Everything under control. Tickety boo.
More tea?
Come on, Hancock, you wanker!
Come on!
There must be something.
Come on!
Tony?
Where are you going?
  Join the library.
  But it's half past eight.
Please, Tony, don't.
Please.
We've been so good.
You don't need it.
It's just a dip.
Please.
Library was closed. George and I had just the one.
You shit!
I work for Mr Hancock. I do what he tells me.
Get out.
Bastard, bastard, bastard!
Good job I didn't buy you Champagne.
You selfish, selfish shit!
Oh, fuck off.
Don't drink that. Please.
Fuck off!
Tony...
You want this?
Fun, isn't it?
Ow!
You should get out.
Before I hurt you.
Before I kill you.
Oh, Christ.
Where's Joanie? Get Joanie.
What?
Where is she?
  I've failed him.
  He failed you.
He practically killed you.
I'm all he's got. I'm the only one who believes in him.
You're the most important thing in his world. But can't you see?
The longer you're with him, the more likely it is you'll end up
the least important thing in his world, because you won't exist. You'll just become part of him.
And he'll shut the door on you, just like he keeps shutting it on himself. Think about yourself.
Your life.
David. John.
What about everyone else, Joan?
What am I going to do?
At least you'll be able to get that nice Cadillac back now, won't you?
Shall we call George?
Thank God.
I'm sorry, Johnny.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right, my sweet.
It's all right. You're home now...
Oh, brass monkeys out there tonight!
I bet it's warmer where John is. Lucky so and so.
  I'd love to go to Rome.
  Bet you two wish you'd gone with him.
John does go to all the best places, doesn't he?
  Maybe I'll be an actor when I grow up.
  Either that or work for a living, eh?
  'The Troggs.
'Thank you, boys. Now, we promised you a...
'mystery guest tonight, and I don't think you'll be disappointed...'
  No, no! Watch the chair cover.
  He's all right.
'..recently returned from an eventful tour of Australia.
'Please welcome the one, the only, The Lad Himself, Tony Hancock.'
  We don't want this.
  No!
Dad. Please. I want to see.
'How are you? Please, take a seat.
  'You look well.
'I feel well. Best for years.
'Now, I said you'd had an eventful tour of Australia.
'That's putting it mildly, isn't it?
  'Whatever can you mean?
  You fell off the stage in Melbourne?
'I... No, the stage ran out in Melbourne.
  'I was going like a train.
'There was just no more stage.
'The annoying thing was that I was completely sober at the time.
'I blame the cholera injections.
'That's a new one.
'No, no, I'm serious.
'They whack the stuff in where the sun doesn't shine.
'You have a couple of shandies and before you know it you've fallen into the laps of 2,000 Aussies.
'Very nasty, I can tell you.'
  Mum...
  Yes.
Don't tell Nanny or Papa that I told you...
I heard them talking last night and they said
that Tony rang yesterday and wanted to talk to you.
They told him that you were back with John and, um...
to leave you alone.
Was it right to tell you?
Of course it was, sweetheart.
Come on, bed.
Dad, it's all right, really.
I saw the way you looked at him.
Dad, I said it's all right.
I'm just going for a walk.
I need to get some air.
Please...
Hello.
  Hello.
  It's me.
Does John know you're here?
He's not back till tonight.
I'm going back, you know?
  Where?
  Oz.
I've signed up for a series.
You're joking?
SHE SIGHS Why can't you take up plumbing or something?
It's a chance. I have to do it.
But we're getting back to the old Hancock.
Get out the old homburg...astrakhan.
Don't do it. Don't go.
Come with me, Joanie.
The divorce'll be through in a couple of months.
We'll be shot of the lot of them.
We could start again.
I'm useless without you.
What about me?
What about you?
What do I do?
Who am I?
Christ! You're you. You're me.
We'll be together.
You still love me, don't you?
Johnny.
I'm so sorry...darling.
Have you been back long?
Not long. I must have missed you at the airport.
Yes.
Well, no...
Oh, never mind. I'd love a drink.
Of course. You must be exhausted.
It was Marion. She's had a bit of a crisis  
he's upped and left her.
  Yes, she called, actually.
  Oh?
About ten minutes ago.
Just...wanted a chat.
Wondered where you were.
Like I say, she's all over the place.
I think I'll have an early night.
Christ! What am I doing?
  The other side of the fucking world!
  You've got to be strong.
I'm fed up being strong.
I'm fed up having to fight. Stone me,
haven't I fought enough?
Why won't it shut up for two seconds?
  Shhh, shhh.
  Up here! Shut up and leave me in peace!
Shhh. It's all right. HE BREATHES HEAVILY
I can't do it without you.
Come with me.
Please, please.
Please, Joanie. I've got a bad feeling.
Listen, listen...
  Without you there...
  Listen to me. Listen. Listen.
I will make you a promise...
..and it is the last and biggest promise I will ever make.
I will leave John for good.
No, no, no.
And I will marry you,
but only if you stay off the booze.
Prove to me that you can do it.
Prove it.
And you'll marry me?
But you mustn't fail me.
Not again.
That is what this is for.
Australia.
It's your final test.
I'll prove it.
I will.
I want you so much.
You'll marry me.
I know you will.
'My darling Joan.
'I'm already missing you so badly.
'I finally arrived in Sydney to all the usual hullabaloo.'
I'm feeling in great shape, yes.
Looking forward to the new series? What are you calling it?
Hancock Down Under. Yes, very much so, yes.
First time I've done a series in colour, so you'll be getting the lot.
  Sunburn and all.
'They've stuck me in some awful hotel on my own.
'I wish you were here with me. But I'm being a good boy.
'You'd be proud.
'If only Australia could be moved a little nearer to Ramsgate.
'Please keep the letters coming, my darling.
'I will write as soon as I possibly can.
'You are never out of my mind.
'All my love, always...
'Tony.'
PEN TAPS ON GLASS So, we open on board ship.
Business with stewards.
Business with deckchairs and cue.
"There were times when I think that not every Englishman is worthy of carrying Her Majesty's passport.
"Look at 'em, rolling about there  
"a whole nation of sitters. That's what's become of us.
"Of course, we Hancocks have always been a seafaring race.
"If it hadn't been a question of time I'd have sailed across single handed.
"Life's just too short to fit everything in.
"I've got to help build up a new country.
"I wonder if Matilda's still waltzing around with that kangaroo?"
Thank you.
Well done.
It seemed to go all right.
Better than all right.
Those execs are purring. They've got a lot riding on this.
  They're not the only ones.
  'Good news. Ed...
  ..the South African director,
'is renting a house with his family for the week.
'It's got a ground floor flat, so they've got me out of that bloody hotel away from temptation.
'The series is going all right.
'Three episodes so far and I haven't fallen on my arse yet, so they tell me, anyway.
'I'm meant to be seeing some rough cuts tomorrow, so...fingers crossed.
'No letter came from you today, or yesterday, so naturally I was a bit disappointed.
'I hope everything's all right.
'No doubt it's difficult for you with John.
'Please write soon.
'The more I hear from you, the more it helps.
'I hold onto the fact that we will be together in time.
'My love, always...
'Tony.'
Mrs Le Mesurier?
I'm from the Sunday Express. Am I, er...talking to Mr Hancock's mystery woman?
'Hancock, I thought you might like a pint.
  'Have you any idea what time it is?
  Er, yes.
'About 6 o'clock.
'That'd make it 10 o'clock in London...
'It is the cocktail hour and you bring me a pint of crudely iced beer,
'wearing what I can only describe as totally informal dress!
'At cocktail hour, be it in Bombay or Brixton, people should be properly attired.'
Please, please, don't name me. Not for my sake, but for John's sake.
  And... And my son, David.
  Where's your husband at the moment?
He's filming in Rome.
This would mortify him, making this public.
You'll be cited in the divorce.
Say it was a fling. Print that if you have to.
It was a harmless fling, which I regret bitterly
and now it's over.
Yeah, I knew this would be the end of it.
She probably had to say that to get them off her hands.
Christ, you know what they're like.
They haven't named her. That's something, I suppose.
But she hasn't written for days.
Nothing.
'Mr Hancock to the studio floor, please.
'Mr Hancock to the studio floor.'
  It's over.
Mr Joffe, they're waiting for you.
Hey, Tony. Come on.
Let's knock 'em dead out there today, eh?
You had them all going yesterday.
They bloody love you out there on the floor, mate. They love you!
Right, let's get this show on the road!
Come on.
Do it now. Just do it, just do it, just do it, just do it.
Do it, do it, do it.
Come on, you old...
'I loved you more than I thought possible.
'But now I realise that you never shared this feeling.
'I now leave you to your own life.'
Hello. Operator?
Yes, I need you to find me a number in Australia.
It's ATN in Syd... CLATTERING
  It's John. He's back this evening.
  I know.
I need to get back to town. Could you give me a lift to the station, Dad?
I might just get the ten past.
There's no hurry, is there?
  You said his plane...
  Dad, now!
I need to go NOW!
'You told me enough times I was wasting my life.
'Now I say the same to you.
'I shall not brood over you.
'In a few weeks, our relationship will be dead.
'Cold...and unremembered.'
Hello, Operator. Yes, I'd like a number, please,
in Australia. As soon as you can.
Rehearsal room. No, they finished a couple of hours ago.
Yeah, well, a lot of people'd like to speak to Mr Hancock.
Look, I'm sorry. You'll just have try the press people in the morning.
She's left me. I know she has.
  She said she wouldn't...
She said she would always be there!
Shh...it's all right.
All right.
  What am I going to do?
I'll find her for you.
Just calm down, there's a good boy.
Calm down.
Wait there. Be still.
I'll find her.
Hello.
Oh.
I see.
Sorry. Um, I'm afraid we can't help you.
Joan...
Joan is in Rome with John.
They're very happy again.
As far as she's concerned, this whole business is over.
I'm sorry.
'Forget her, love.'
  Forget her?
  You go to sleep.
Go to sleep?
I will. I will, Lily.
You've got work in the morning.
  Kiss, kiss.
Kiss, kiss.
Hello.
Oh, God!
Yes.
Yes.
No. Thank you.
Who is it?
You're awake.
What is it?
What's the matter?
I should have gone.
If I'd gone, he'd still be here.
It didn't surprise me when Eddie Joffe telephoned.
I knew.
Tony left two notes.
The papers only mentioned one.
There was a second.
Barely legible and...
written later, it seems.
It was addressed to me.
He apologised for causing me more grief...
..and then he said something.
He wanted a message passed on to me.
He said the soul was everlasting...
..and that I would understand.
I think he finally realised, at the end...
..that his soul was his gift,
and it would never die.
I tried so hard to make him understand, but...
..he could just never see it.
All he could see was an empty hole
that he filled with drink.
I'll keep wishing a terrible thing.
I keep wishing it was John who was gone and not Tony!
  John is a good man.
  Don't hurt him any more.
Tony never wanted that.
He loved John.
Get on with your life, Joan.
'You've had a fairly tortured time of it.
'Who hasn't?
'I don't regret it,'
but I wouldn't want to go through it again.
I've tried to do the very best that I can.
Nothing worse than to come off and disappoint them.
But sometimes, maybe, the audience ask a little too much.
We just try to give...
as much as possible.
It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where
Or when
Who knows where or when?
