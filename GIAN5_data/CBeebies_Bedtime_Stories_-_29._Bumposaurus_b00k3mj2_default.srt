Hello. I'm Keeley and this is the CBeebies Bedtime Hour.
Hold on...can you see me?
I can't see you properly. Why don't you come a bit closer?
There we go. That's better.
I can see you now.
Tonight's story is about someone who can't see very well.
It's called Bumposaurus.
he couldn't find his way out of his egg.
Bump! Bump! Bump! He went, inside the shell.
At last, his mother heard him bumping, and helped him out.
"I think we'll call you Bumposaurus", she said.
Bumposaurus ran off, straight past his brothers and sisters,
and he landed in a very deep bog.
"Bumpy's stuck!"
Mother hauled him out, licking the mud lovingly off his nose.
"He's obviously the adventurous type", she said to Father.
"Come and play chase, Bumpy", cried his brothers and sisters.
"You're it!" and they ran off, giggling.
Bumposaurus stretched his long neck this way and that.
"Where are you?" he called.
"We're over here!" they cried, creeping closer.
Still, he couldn't see them.
"Here!" they cried, creeping closer still.
"Oh, there you are!" cried Bumposaurus.
Bump, bump, bump!
Mother gave them each a loving lick.
"Lunch time!" she said.
Lunch was leaves.
Lunch was always leaves.
"Not leaves again!" moaned the babies.
"Now, children", scolded their father.
"You know we brontosauruses don't believe in eating other dinosaurs."
Bumposaurus began to munch obediently on what lay before him.
It turned out to be his sister's tail.
"Father!" she shrieked.
"Bumpy's eating me!"
"Bumposaurus", said Father, sternly.
"Eating dinosaurs is wrong!"
After lunch, Bumposaurus went off to explore.
Bump! His head hit something hard.
He looked up.
The "something" stretched high above him.
"Sorry, Father", he said. "I didn't see you."
Father said nothing.
"I know you're cross about me eating Bella   I didn't mean to".
Still, Father said nothing.
"You see, Father, I think there's something wrong with me.
"I feel as though I'm different from the others."
And he poured out the whole story.
But Father still said nothing.
He couldn't. Because in fact, he was a tree.
"Oh, well." sighed Bumposaurus.
"If you're that angry, I'll have to leave home."
And he set off.
Bumposaurus came to the edge of a wide river.
"Lucky these logs are here   I don't have to get my feet wet.
"Phew! What a hot day it is.
"Funny. There doesn't seem to be anybody else about."
By now, Bumposaurus felt like giving up and going home.
He was covered in bumps.
He was tired and lonely and longing for a loving lick from Mother.
At last, he stumbled into a sandy hollow.
"Home!" he cried in joy.
And he snuggled up cosily, and fell asleep...
next to a very large tyrannosaurus rex!
The tyrannosaurus was sleeping off a heavy meal  
most definitely NOT of leaves.
He was very surprised when he woke to find a small brontosaurus
fast asleep in his nest.
"Yum", he said, and gave Bumpy an experimental lick.
"You're not my mother!" yelped Bumpy,
waking up with a jump.
"No. But you're my pudding."
And the tyrannosaurus grinned a horrible grin,
bristling with razor sharp teeth.
But, just at that moment, there came a thunderous sound
of 40 galloping feet.
"Eating dinosaurs is wrong!"
"Quite right, quite right," the tyrannosaurus said, quickly.
"What was I thinking of? Please excuse me."
And he ran off.
When Bumposaurus got home,
his mother gave him the most loving lick ever.
"Say hello to Grandma, Bumposaurus", she said.
"Where?" said Bumposaurus.
"Here!" said a gentle voice.
And a soft and wrinkled face bent close to his.
"Now you can see me, can't you?" she said.
"What are those circles round your eyes, Grandma?" asked Bumpy.
"Try them on and see, little one", she said.
Bumposaurus slipped the glasses onto his nose.
Oh!
At once, a wonderful world of smiling faces leapt out at him.
At last, he could see.
That story was called Bumposaurus.
I'm so glad Grandma's glasses helped Bumposaurus see better.
But now, it's time to close your eyes and go to sleep.
And who knows? You might see some wonderful things
while you're dreaming.
Night night!
Sweet dreams.
