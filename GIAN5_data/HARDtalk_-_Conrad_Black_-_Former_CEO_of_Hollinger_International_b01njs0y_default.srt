to maintain the ship. Now on BBC News it is time for
HARDtalk. From global media baron to
convicted criminals serving time in a Florida prison, the remarkable
rise and fall of Conrad Black, it has made full use of lurid
headlines, not least in the newspapers that he used to our own.
Now Conrad Black is a free man out to rebuild his reputation on both
sides of the Atlantic. After a turbulent decade, is he a changed
man? Conrad Black, Lord Blyth, welcome
to HARDtalk. You have had an amazing few years, full of bitter
legal battles, and the best part of three years in a US prison. How has
the experience changed do? Significantly, I think so. I
consider live to be a privilege in every form. Even though my
circumstances were much changed, there were still interest. I had to
undergo a process, that I had been falsely accused and falsely
convicted, the fact that I knew it had happene had happenenot prepare me
but I got through it best I can. Falsely accused and falsely
imprisoned, those are notions that I would like to test. But before I
test them, I would like to spend some time considering the rise of
Conrad Black. I want to know why you chose to exercise all your
energy and you dry up in the newspaper industry. It was not your
family's business. Why were you so determined to become a global
player in newspapers? My greatest interest was in the newspaper
business, and the reason was because about time, and we are
going back, many years ago, more than 40 years, in the late 60s, at
that time, it was a very good business as a business. It had 20%
margin, pre tax profit on total turnover, and that is quite a
handsome return for a business. It was not really labour intensive,
you had plenty of personnel, but it was not overly labour intensive,
like the retail business, and it was not terribly capital intensive
as well. You had to buy new presses every 20 years, but you did not
have to constantly renew it. And beyond that, it was the news, and
by definition it was interesting. It brought you in contact with news
makers. You had a ringside seat on everything. There was a financial
proposition that you found attractive, and to build this
empire, you acquired newspapers right across the globe, but it
brought to something else, the proximity to power. Not just power,
but interesting people. A lot of them are not powerful but they have
done interesting things. When you brought the Daily Telegraph, you
said you had finally a meaningful political voice. That is true.
it ego? It is a rather truncated description. But one can enjoy it
for reasons other than ego. It is not that I thought, and no way in
my book that you will find any suggestions of it, but I thought I
had any great power, but it is undoubtedly interesting in a way,
and not a describable way, satisfying to know that you had
access. When you dined with prime ministers... but I was never
distracted into the delusion that it conferred any great power on to
myself. Very rarely did I any desert any influence on anybody.   
exert. But you will not be stand back newspaper proprietor. That is
a complete fraud. That is like the head of a company is saying that he
is not concerned with the quality of the product. I said as long as
we separate opinion from comment, and as we make the paper
interesting, you would have my absolute support, and not one of my
editors would say that I embark a varied that support. You speak of
Max Hastings, I called him once at ten minutes to midnight. He
exaggerates. He said the best cure to mental depression was a cup of
tea. I want to tease out the rise of Conrad Black. You had acquired
more newspapers, you were making big profits, the turnover of the
group was $2 billion, and then things started to go wrong. Profits
were down, investment was down. And yet as we now know, and that brings
us to the legal battles that to Ford, the payments be received by
you, Conrad Black, from various financial vehicles, were
extraordinary high, into the millions and millions of dollars.
That raised amount    alarm bells from the minority shareholders.
never made more than $2.5 million. It is not excessive for a $2
billion company. It is not a change. I did not say it was chump change.
You were paying yourself an awful lot of money. Just of options of
stock. Don't imagine that they were living on skid row. I have been in
lifestyle like yours, with the private jets, the mansions in
different locations, and they are high profile extravagance which
made newspaper headlines around the world. You loved all of it. No. I
do not like any reference to extravagance. The private planes
were not private, the company had two, and I used one of them. But so
did editors and employees. I did not use them exclusively. There was
a great deal of hyperbole in certain sections of the media. I
find that kind of discussion, I know that you asked me the
questions, but I find that kind of discussion to be extremely vulgar.
I do not think that shareholders would regarded as vulgar to inquire
that the fact you were using those players for your own personal use
was legitimate. That was a real concern. The total net cost of the
planes, the one plai we hat
we had newspapers in ï¿½120 in the Geographic Society would not have
head the head of National Geographic
magazine would not have heard of any of them any of them them
on United Airlines. The plain that I sometimes used, cost the company
perhaps $1 million a year. I was not the only used up. Far from it.
We had a $400 million pre tax profit. Let's keep things in
to live with the perception, that began with began with tigation
commissioned by your own company, it went through US federal criminal
investigators, it went through the courts, to the Supreme Court, back
to an appeals court, there has been a constant drip of allegations
against you, many of them were ultimately not turned into criminal
charges, that at the end of all of this, you sit here as a convicted
criminal. That is the trip. No, it is not and I will tell you why. In
the first place, let us take note of the $500 million... it takes
down    it comes down to the rejection by jurors. And the
spurious retrieval by a judge in such    Chicago of $285,000. That
money, it is uncontested, it was approved by the audit committee,
are approved by the directors, part of a much larger profit that the
company made as a result of my actions, was received by its office,
and I was assured by the senior legal officer out that it was
lawful, and it was fully publicised and highlighted in the filings.
problem that you have, as I ended in my previous statement, was that
you are a convicted criminal. And you said no. The reason I said no,
is to fold, I requested to be judged on the basis of what the law
would decid would decidWith respect, that is irrelevant. You
chose to do business in the US. Implicitly, you must abide by the
laws of the land. And Nelson Mandela at lives in South Africa.
Would you call him a convicted criminal? And you feel that you
work living in North Korea, as how they approach to the rule of law?
90% are settled on a plea. The 3% that are trialled, 85% of them are
in dictions. People receive four times as great... that will not
stand up in any court of law. The basis for your innocence? I will
tell you the basis for my innocence. If these matters occurred in this
country, no charges would have been laid, the same in Canada. The
second thing, if it had been vacated by the High Court
unanimously, they would not have remanded into the same people, the
instruction to look at the grave city of their own areas.    gravity.
I agree on its face and that it was a conviction... it leaves you with
a criminal record and are able to enter the US. That is the reality
that to appear are able to deal with. You have to accept that if
you are going to answer the questions, my presence here is
irrelevant. I can deal with it, but I expect the status to change.
Three, the case that remains of it, is still under appeal. Of course it
is under appeal. You never give up. Why should I, I am innocent.
stand before me not as an innocent man but a convicted criminal. It is
the psychology that I am interested in. Let me ask you something that
is relevant to what you are asking me. Let's say for a moment that I
actually broke the law, but what is the idea? I served three years in a
US prison, so I am not a criminal any more. You still had a criminal
record. If you actually believe all the buck, and no Americans do,
because they know how the system works, it is this insane head boy
it using trainers that I encounter in this country. The British know
that the US is a half mad country, they know how corrupt the justice
system is, why am I being confronted with this? If it is a
half mad country, with a legal system akin to North Korea, why did
you embrace it? You have a palatial home in Florida, you had a home in
New York. You appear to relish life in this land which you now...
a great country, the fact that it has prosecuted me. North Korea is
not a great country. The legal systems are the same, but not in
any other ways. Do you believe the legal system is rotten in the core,
you would not have invested tens of millions of dollars in businesses
that were fundamental to you and your shareholders. It would have
been utterly irresponsible. If I had known how corrupt the legal
system was, I would not have I just wonder, perhaps on a
philosophical level, as you sat in prison, you had plenty of time to
think. I wonder if you were thinking about other mistakes that
you made. Beyond a certain point, you will appreciate that it is not
a legitimate thing for the BBC to ask me that. I have confessions to
make and unmake them to authorised professionals indiscreet
circumstances.    and I make them. I believe in confession and I
believe in the punishment of crime. I also believe it when people have
paid the legally approved penalty, that is the end of that. They
should stop being badgered. What about reflecting on shareholders?
Let me tell you something, brother. They had a flourishing company for
two years after I left. The you are seeing the collapse of Hollinger
had nothing to do with you. The I ran a good company and nobody
disputes that. Do you regard it as a mistake that you gave up your
Canadian citizenship? You used some words which infuriated you fellow 
countryman. You said that Canada had become a trap for you and it
had become an impediment to your progress. Do you regret that?
I have made amends for it. It is more complicated than that. Can I
Finnish answer to the previous question? Abul put them together.  
  Finnish answer. I will put them together. I did contemplate,
naturally, as any sane person would, what mistakes I had made. If I had
not made any, I would not have been there. I made mistakes to be there.
I am not trying to catch you out but I would be fascinated to know
what you regard as a mistake. too much trust in a partner could
turn date to be criminal and they could not have known that. I did
not know how dangerous the legal system was. I was naive. I thought
there was no problem and that would be the end of it. They tore the
place apart and fattened up the legal fees and destroyed the
company. That is what normally happens. I made a number of
mistakes. I did not take the corporate government seriously. It
is essentially a fraud but I did not realise it had great currency
and could severely disrupt my ability to run the company. All of
those were mistakes. The message is, you were naive. Nothing more than
that. I committed no ethical or legal errors. I asked you about
Canada. You give up your citizenship. You wanted to come
here. You could not do that without giving up citizenship. The manner
in which she did it infuriated Canadians. More than 60 % said they
do not want you to become a citizen again. You are referring to one
poll in a newspaper that I never did own that said 68 % of people
were opposed to what was put as a question that was never in fact on
offer as an alternative. You said I should not be allowed back in the
country. Do you think that the British public would be comfortable
with the notion of using in your seat in the UK house of Lords?
Playing a role in the British legislative process. I come back to
it, on the record, in the United States, you have a criminal record.
Do the British people want that? think if they knew the facts they
would be comfortable. Unless it was pushed in their faces in a rather
exaggerated way by the British media then they would not much care.
Why should they care? It is academic. I would have no thought
of trying to play any role in the House of Lords unless controversy
and emotion had subsided and there was a general comfort level about
this. Let's face it, 90 % of people don't care about me and why should
they? If I was a resident here,    unless I was a resident here, I
could not come flitting in and out. Also, if I ceased to be, as they
have been because of this persecution in the United States,
distracted from these problems. I only know the names of about six to
seven of the cabinet secretaries. I used to know all these people. I
was involved. Before I would consider thinking I could think in
these terms, I would have to be back here but everything settled
down and know what I am talking about. You said you used to know
these guys. I wonder where the meaning of your life lies now. You
were such a driven man to get into newspapers. What drives you now?
am and relaunch mode. You come back from it. I was officiously    I was
viciously, murderously assaulted. You will never go back into
newspapers. It is not a vibrant industry these days. You will not
go back to the top table of the political elite. What will you do?
I am disappointed with politicians. In all my time, only three or four
made a difference. This has flourished my time as a writer. It
has not damaged mac talents as a financier. Disappointed by
politicians is an interested    interesting phrase. I don't expect
things from them. You expected from George W Bush. You thought you
could call in some chips. You had supported them. It never happened.
me that something could be done. ignored due? He did not reject it.
He did not do anything. What does that tell you about the alliance's
and friendships you thought you had? That is a general question.
Most people I thought were friends. 95 % of the people, including
prominent people in this country that they thought were friends,
have been magnificent. If Mitt Romney were to win the presidency,
would you like to see him offer you a pardon? Is it something you might
expect? I would not expect a pardon. You cannot go to the United States
unless something happens. The way I had been treated, I cannot. I would
face up but with fortitude and courage. America is a great world.
such moral turpitude is to be a threat to American society. That is
the recommendation of the court in due cackle and on my prohibition.  
  the court in Chicago. I do not care about a pardon. I hope to win
my appeal. If I do not, I deliver the verdict. I will publish more
akin to that.    I will live with the verdict. As far as I am
concerned, I won that battle. final thought, not so long ago, you

destroy your lifestyle. And the recent past, you had to clean out
of prison toilet. A shower stall. I never cleaned the latrine. I stand
corrected. As a result what happened to you, are you a humbler
man? I hope so. Do you think? hope so. I think so. I don't want
to be in the position of moral a signing my own expense account. I
try. I do my best. I am a conscientious Christian who tries
to be a decent person. I am not under the illusion I am the nicest
