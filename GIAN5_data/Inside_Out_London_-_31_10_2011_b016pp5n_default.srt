A busy night in Wigan town centre. Like most towns on a weekend, it is
rowdy, there is lots of alcohol, It is a world that the delight but

officer, this was his beat. always was happy to get involved,
and I wasn't frightened of being, you know, arresting people, getting
involved, doing the actual job of a police officer, rather than being
somebody just standing mayor in a uniform. But getting involved
changed his life. Filmed on CCTV, he and two full time colleagues
were called to deal with a man outside a nightclub. The only thing
we knew was that he had been causing problems, and we had been
called by the door staff to deal with it. He was pushed, he stumbled,
and he fell into the road and banged his head on the floor. He
came back and started remonstrating with us. The three officers tried
to move him on, but he would not go, During the arrest, the man on the
floor, Mark Aspinall, bites one of the officers are on the leg. It
takes the three of them to carve him. There has been situations
throughout my service that have been like that and worse.
Situations like that in Wigan happen all the time. Magistrates
found Mark Aspinall, a former soldier, guilty of assault and
public disorder. So everything seemed pretty straightforward to
Peter Lightfoot, a normal night on the streets, if you like, but
everything was to change, and in the end he would find himself here
Mark Aspinall later complained about the way he was arrested and
appealed his assault conviction. The CCTV footage was watched again.
This time, the appeal judge said it was the police officers who had
behaved badly, abusing their powers. Mark Aspinall's conviction for
assault was quashed. Greater Manchester police launched an
investigation into the way their own officers had acted that night.
It looks like you're banging his face. I have got hold of his head
there, and what he has tried to do is move his head forward to bite,
and I am pulling it back, but it looks like I am rubbing his head on
the floor. But that is not what I was doing. It also shows him
repeatedly punching Mark Aspinall. So you have hit him. Yes. And again.
Yes. A lot of punches. Yeah, six. It looks like you're giving in a
leather ring. It does. I took my own initiative from remembering
what you can do within the training that we were given, to punch a
muscle area on his shoulder to try and make him release his arm. On my
sixth bunch, he actually released his arm enough to wrench it out,
and then we got the handcuff on him, and that was it, game over. Peter
Lightfoot and the two full time officers face criminal charges. It
went to trial. His colleagues were cleared, but Peter was jailed. He
served seven months of a three year sentence for assault and perjury.
At the heart of policing is your ability and the great British
tradition to use the minimum of force, to deal with violent
situations, to not lose your temper, and that is the standard that we
set. And Mr Lightfoot fell below that standard. I do not believe I
went too far, I did what any other police officer would do. The
problem is, when you are there at the situation, you have got a split
second to deal with and to make a decision on what you are going to
do, and you have got to live with that decision. It does not matter
what your record is or how many lives you have saved or whatever.
If you break the law, you are just as liable as any other citizen, and
we set a very high standard, and I do not apologise for that. So, open

his sister Hayleigh will never forget the night they have to call
I ran down the stairs, and I heard Anne Aaron shouting, get off me.
And then he started coming towards me, so my mum got Inbetweeners.
From that moment, I saw him with a knife in his hand, stabbing mum.
When they caught Northamptonshire Police, then mum's partner, armed
with a knife, was still in the house, and Aaron was trying to keep
his mother alive. I was just expecting the police to come
straight away. Time was going so slow, I did not know what to do. I
started to wonder whether they would come. Paramedics had arrived,
but the police had not, so they were stuck outside. The police did
not arrive until 19 minutes after the first 999 call. Martin Ashby
was arrested. Then mum, a Louise Webster, was dead. It was too late.
He felt like part of you had just died. One the family did not know
was that two Northamptonshire Police officers were practically at
the bottom of their street when Louise Webster was being attacked
and in children asked for help. The call to the emergency services was
made at 11 minutes past midnight. No, we know where the police
officers work, because there was a GPS transmitter in their car, and
at 12 minutes past, one minute later, and again at quarter past,
we know they were in the immediate vicinity of Abbots Way. They were
just down the road. It took an inquiry by the Independent Police
Complaints Commission to discover that, minutes later, as they left
the village, the officers refused to attend the emergency call.
they were and our shoes, they would want everything to help them, but
we had nothing that night. We had to rely on each other, to look
after each other and to look after mum, and to just try and be as safe
as we could within that half hour. Why would the officers not respond?
They said they were busy on an operation based six miles away in
Northampton. They claimed that they ended up at the bottom of the
Websters Panorama Road because they had followed a car there, but then
notebook show they had not dealt with a single incident in the
previous six hours.    the West theres' Road. They knew it was a
serious crime, at the end of the day they should have gone. No two
ways about it. It would not have cost them anything to have gone.
Medical experts said that Louise Webster's life could not have been
saved. Kirk Ola, Martin Ashby, was jailed for life.    Birkenau.   
Birkenau. The IPCC ruled that the officers had failed in their sworn
duty to protect life for at least attempt to do so. They are forced
decided this was a case of gross misconduct. The definition of gross
misconduct his conduct for which an officer is likely to be sacked, so
clearly that is the risk the officer is facing. So would they
lose their jobs? That was another decision for Northamptonshire
Police. Two senior officers and an independent person looked at the
information, and the result was that the two offices kept their
jobs and received a final written warnings. It really does not mean
anything at all. Just make sure you keep your nose clean in the future,
that is it. What is wrong with that? If they are not doing their
job properly, they should have been some other form of punishment,
surely. They should have left their jobs for that. If they could not
turn up to something so important, like that, then what are they
actually going to turn up to? this case, the family thought the
officers got off incredibly likely. I can understand how they feel like
that. I can only say, from our point of view, these things are
investigated very seriously, and the panels take them very seriously.
When it comes to misconduct cases, the police investigate themselves.
The IPCC have a role in only a small number of very serious cases.
The most they can do is identify misconduct. The punishment is
completely down to the individual officers' force. The panels which
decide the outcome of misconduct hearings almost always sit in
private. Individual forces deal with their own cases behind closed
doors. Jocelyn Cockburn is a lawyer who specialises in handling cases
against the police. The problem is that you get inconsistency, but
there is not transparency in the first place. That is where there is
a gap here, because there's very little evidence to show that
lessons are being learned. Police misconduct can be anything from
rudeness to physical violence. Now, the police are supposed to be one
of the most regulated public bodies, but who is making sure the
misconduct panels do their job? There is no overall body that has
responsibility for the police misconduct system, other than the
Home Office, I daresay. So no one was watching that area. Individual
forces report to individual police authorities, so the authorities
have a role there, but a single overarching body? I don't believe
there is. Should they be? Very So, how many decisions are made
about police misconduct with little or no national oversight? Well,
it's not easy to find out. We put in freedom of information requests
to 53 forces in the UK. 47 of them responded.
We discovered that there were 1,915 guilty findings against officers
for misconduct between 2008 and 2010.
382 were dismissed or required to resign. So nearly a fifth of
punishments handed down ended in officers leaving the force.
And all of these decisions about police misconduct are being made in
private, with almost no national oversight.
What is lost, do you think, the fact that nobody has that single
overview? Well, I think it makes consistency a problem. Guidance can
be a problem. And I think it does have an impact
on public confidence. Are you confident with a system
with no national overview? Well, we have 43 forces in the country. So
we are not a national system. The Independent Police Complaints
Commission has a system? They are away what is happening with
misconduct. They say it is not down to them.
They do report cases, trends. They don't have to? Police
authority is locally overseeing what is happening. They are aware
of the case, the complaints, they take it very seriously.
So what can the police forces do to make sure that their officers get
it right in the first place? Back in Durham, they're preparing their
officers for the complicated situations that they might face.
But as Sergeant Andy Sutherland knows, training won't always
protect officers from complaints by the public.
How often have complaints been made against you? Hmm in my service,
probably seven or eight times. Is that common? Yeah, I think it is
probably reflective. If you are dealing with members of
the public in high stress situations, occasionally as a
police officer you are going to get it wrong.
Those public complaints against Andy were not upheld. Last year
around 30,000 were levelled at the police nationally, but when jobs
are on the line, can officers afford to admit that they might
have made a mistake? Do you think that the majority of officers find
it difficult to admit that they are wrong? It is not that they find it
difficult, but they are suspicious. They don't trust the system. We
need a more common sense approach that admits that the police
officers are human. That they do sometimes make mistakes and is
accepting of that. That is hard when police failures
lead to terrible loss. Harder still when you are let down not just by
one force, by four. I heard a car pull up. I didn't
look out of the window. Sometimes you see a car, you listen or look
out of the window to see who it is, that night I didn't.
That was... That was the night that he came and picked her up outside
of my house. In Darlington, Andrea Hall's 17 year old daughter, Arbly
was befriended online by a 33 year  old man pretending to be a young
lad. Would she talk to you about
boyfriends? That was the odd bit. Yeah, she used to tell me
everything until that night. 24 hours after Ashley walked from
the door, her mother's frantic calls to her mobile phone were
answered. By this time I was shouting down
the phone, "Who are you jj" he would ask who I was, but I said
that this was my daughter's phone, I wanted to know why he had it.
It was a police officer. Ashley's phone had been found after
being arrested for a driving offence. When he was taken to the
This man is Peter Chapman. He had just confessed to killing Andrea's
daughter. You get that horrible, horrible
feeling inside you like it is just... I can't explain. Just like
your heart is being ripped out. Ashley had been raped and murdered
by Peter Chapman, her body found in a ditch at the side of the road.
If I had stuck to saying "no", she would never have gone, sorry...
Sorry. She wouldn't have gone. She would
have stayed. You can't blame yourself.
Yeah, but you do. What Andrea did not know then is
that Peter Chapman could have been stopped. He was a known sex
offender, supposing to be monitored by the Merseyside Police, but for
nine months they did not know where he was.
One force had lost track of him. Three others then failed to stop
him. Because just three days before
Ashley was murdered, a Nationwide alert had been put out for Peter
Chapman. During that time his car was spotted near Ash ley's home 16
times by special police cameras that recognise registration numbers.
On some occasions the police had looked for him, but twice, in
Cleveland, 48 hours after Ashleyy was killed, they didn't.
The police were given information, they were looking alt information
from the cameras. Then, the problem was not spotted. The people who
were supposed to be watching were not logged on to the system. By
this time Ashley was in his car. As the night moved on, he was spotted
again by cameras across the north  east, but nothing was done.
During that journey, Ashley was killed.
Who do you blame for her death? blame him because he did it, but I
also blame the police for not doing their job properly. I always will.
The IPCC produced two reports into Ashley Hall's death. They called
for a review on the way that the police cameras are operated and
criticised Merseysideside's poor monitoring the of sex offenders.
They said that although the murder was missed it may not have been
possible to prevent the death, but her mother is clear, the police let
her and her daughter down. Now I have read that, I know for a
fact that my daughter would still be here today. There is no
questions about it. She would definitely be here. That makes me
feel worse now. They could have prevented all of this.
What concerns Andreas the most about the IPCC report is that no 
one was blamed. In no place was anyone held accountable where the
killer was spotted. Only two low ranking officers
received management advice. Across the whole Merseyside force no
senior officers were held to account. So why isn't the IPCC
harder on the police? All of the criticisms, it is normally low 
ranking officers that may end up with the punishment, is that a fair
criticism? No, I don't. We follow the evidence where it takes us if
it takes us to higher levels in the organisation, there are examples
where we have done this, we expect to see action taken at those levels.
So you expect it see action? Yes, and we will take action. Determine
a case to answer at that level if that is appropriate.
It took Andrea nearly two years to find out what went wrong. Even now
she is still not happy about the way she's been treated. Durham
Police apologised to Andrea, for failing to react when Chapman's car
was caught on its cameras, they believe that forces need to change,
that when things go wrong, the police should be more open.
I think whenever a family is bereaved, there is a sense that
something could have been done more to prevent it we are trying to very
carefully move the culture of the organisation to one of openness.
Where we say sorry, where we list and then we explain and then we
show people that this is what we have learned.
So, in Durham, they are changing the way that complaints are handled.
Now officers may have to deal with their accuser, face to face.
Panorama was given access to the very first time an officer was
called in to explain himself to the woman he arrested.
So, how does it feel to be here today? I'm nervous.
Donna was arrested during a row with her neighbours, she think that
the officer was heavy handed. In my opinion I was arrested for no
reason. Whilst being arrested I suffered injuries to my hands and
thumb. Donna, I'm Gary Davidson.
Donna wanted the police officer to answer for his actions, this is the
first time she has seen him since he arrested her.
The first person I see in the street is quite an aggressive
female. When you walked in, you had a face
like you wanted to make an arrest, straight away.
I could see that your behaviour was difficult.
street. That made you angry? I'm in too much pain to be angry. Maybe
you mistook my pain for aggression. Offen it is useful for the officer
to listen to the victim in a non  threatening environment to what the
person has to say, then for the person to listen to what was going
on through the officer's mind. remember now. I might adopt a
different set up the next time. I appreciate the conversation. I
have learned, maybe you have learned.
Donna did still not agree with the arrest, but she did have her say.
This system is about being as open as possible when the public
complaints, but Panorama found when the police themselves have a case
to answer, the situation can be different. There is a back door
available to officers who don't want to go through the misconduct
proceedings. You simply retire or resign. Make
the decision yourself, a way of avoiding justice.
We have discovered just how many police officers do walk away.
Our freedom of infection requests, show that over the last three years
at least 489 officers have chosen this route.
If they are allowed to leave the police without any stain on their
character, then there is a chance that they will go and work in
another force. That does happen. There is a judgment about do you
want to wait for a long drawn out disciplinary procedure, which you
know is likely to end in that officer losing their job, or if
