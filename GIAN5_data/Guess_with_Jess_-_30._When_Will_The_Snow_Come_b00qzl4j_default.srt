Guess with Jess today!
Brrr!
Hello! It's really cold and wintry today.
Brrr!
Good thing I've got fur.
Ha ha!
And you know what winter means   snow!
I love snow!
Me too!
Ah! Soft, white, fluffy snow.
Do you remember last winter?
We made patterns with our paw prints.
And I made a snow kitten.
I wonder why it isn't snowing now.
I don't know. Do you, Joey?
Not a clue.
When will the snow come?
Hey, that's the Big Question!
  Who?
  Ask a lot of...
  What?
  Ask a lot of...
  Where?
  Ask a lot of...
  Why?
  Ask a lot of...
  Ask it, test it, find a way
Guess with Jess, come on let's play
What's the question here today?
When will the snow come?
I want to make paw prints.
Let's make our own till the snow comes.
Mimi can help us.
She's brilliant at making things.
Come on, Jess. Let's make some paw prints!
Maybe later. I want to find out when the snow's going to come.
  Woo hoo!
  Wait for me!
I need some help too.
Who should I ask?
Someone who's really smart and clever.
She has a long golden mane.
Yes, Willow!
Come on. Let's go and ask Willow when the snow will come.
So you see, Willow, I really want to make a snow kitten.
Hmm. Maybe if we work where snow comes from
it will give us an idea of when it will come.
OK. Where does the snow come from?
Do you know?
Out of the sea,
out of the ground
or out of the clouds in the sky?
Out of the clouds! That's it.
  Hurray!
Snow comes from clouds.
Thanks, Willow.
Hey, guess what I've found out!
  What?
  The snow comes when there are clouds in the sky.
Hurray!
  Where are they?
  You said there were clouds.
I didn't. I said the snow would come WHEN there were clouds.
Oh!
Maybe Billie and Baa will know where to find clouds.
I'm going to ask them.
OK. Let's carry on making paw prints.
  Yay!
  Yeah!
Come on!
Clouds? Don't you like the sun?
I do but I want to make a snow kitten
and snow comes from clouds.
Snow? Oh, I don't like snow!
It covers all the grass and I can't eat.
It's winter now, Baa. It's got to snow soon.
Oh!
Uh! Jess, look! There are clouds over there.
They're coming this way. That means the snow's coming this way too!
Better...keep eating...
Oh, Baa!
There.
  Wow!
Did you know that every snowflake is different?
Each one has a different pattern.
Wow!
Can we make some now?
Let's make a whole snowstorm!
Ruff, ruff!
  All right!
  Fantastic.
  Great!
Quick! The clouds are coming!
It's going to snow!
Hurray!
Hurray!
You're right, Jess.
Yay!
I felt a snowflake.
Me too!
And I did.
It's snowing! It's snowing!
I can make a snow kitten.
  Yippity yay! Yippity...
  No, Jess.
It isn't snow.
Not snow?
No, it's rain.
Rain?
Oh!
You're right.
Those are rain clouds up there.
Not snow clouds.
Never mind, Jess. It'll snow soon.
Let's go inside before we all get soaked.
Oh! I really want to make a snow kitten.
Mimi...
I'm sure I can make a snow kitten with pretend snow.
Now, let me see.
It needs to be the right colour and soft too.
What can we use to make pretend snow?
White cotton wool,
pink ice cream
or brown twigs?
White cotton wool. You're right!
Yay!
I'll have a snow kitten made in no time.
Thanks, Mimi.
But I still need to answer the Big Question.
It's stopped raining.
Brr! It's chilly.
Come on, run with me to the pond to ask Horace for help.
Oh, yes!
Last winter we had lots of snow.
It was so cold the pond froze over.
Just like it's starting to now.
Oh, yes.
So it is.
Uh! Hey, wait a minute!
  Horace?
  Yeah?
  I thought the rain felt like snow earlier.
  So?
So do you think when rain gets icy cold it turns into snow,
like the way your pond froze?
Oh! Sounds like that might be right, Jess.
From the look of those clouds the snow might not be far away.
That's it! I'm going to tell the others!
See you later.
Brr!
We're chilly.
We've been waiting to show you this, Jess.
Ta dah!
What do you think?
It's lovely, Mimi. Well done!
And guess what  
I think we may be able to build a real snow kitten soon.
Really? Amazing!
How?
Oh! It's starting to rain again.
Not this time, Mimi.
These aren't raindrops, they're snowflakes.
When it gets really chilly cold, the rain turns in to snow.
And, look, it's snowing!
We've found the answer!
  Yippity yay, yippity yay, yippity yay...
  Hurray!
Hey hey
Yippity yay
We've found the answer with Jess today
We followed the clues
We put it to the test
We tried our best And then we've guessed
Singing hey hey
Yippity yay
Here's the answer
Shout hooray!
When it's really, really cold,
the raindrops freeze and turn in to snowflakes.
Is it cold enough to snow where you live?
If not, you can still make snowflakes and the snow kitten.
Ha ha! Come and help me answer another question soon. Bye.
