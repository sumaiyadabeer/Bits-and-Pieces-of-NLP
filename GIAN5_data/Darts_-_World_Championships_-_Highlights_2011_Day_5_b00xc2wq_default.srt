Good evening. What a week we've already had here at Lakeside. Shock
defeats, shock victories, bruised egos, and new reputations
established. And here on Day 5, three more would keep the dream
alive and complete our line up for this quayearpert quarterfinals.
Let's bring you up to speed with what's already happened in the
second round, as if we could forget Coming up today   Alan Thompson up
against Alan 'Chuck' Norris. And 'The Bullet' Bunting against Scotty
George's dark horse. Let's start with the match that
everybody was talking about   Steven 'The But' bunting had the
highest average in the first round. We haven't quite seen his A game
yet. Scotty '2 Hotty' Waites was We'll pick it up at the start of
the fifth set, two sets all. Your commentary from Vassos Alexander,
think it is. They're both playing the 18s didn't. And he's not gonna

believe he's missing the trebles. If Stephen Bunting would give him
the head shake, it would give him a Not in this leg. 'Bullet's number

Very good darts, just not in the he'll be pleased to be only a leg

likes the match because he's   he knows he needs to win the next

I just love playing darts. When you play guys the quality of John
Walton and Scott Waites, it is an and the next, and the next, or

you want to be. But those two blocked it off. He's got to come

honest, it's a miracle Waites is still in this match. Yeah, that's
showing the bisbig difference in the game   the ton scores there
roughly even, but yeah   Stephen is Have a drink for me, sir. Have a
drink on me, Martin, if you turn up for your next match in a purple or
worry, Sallyrry, Sallyot lost in a sudden, he's under all sorts of
pressure. But pressure is something he felt in the Grand Slam of Darts,
and was equal to it. You could see with the throw, there was a bit of
a shake in his hand before he let that one go. So he is feeling the
your hands are shaking, you manage where you want to. Yourrapher one
of the big shakers, Martin. How do you do it? It's something you have
to learn to play with, to be honest. Certain times the nerves get to you
and there's a bit of a shake there. You've still got to make sure you
definitely believe. He's been around the darts scenearts scenewas
a teenager. No one has doubted his talent. And is he about to start

in it, as well. I think he's got Scotty in all sorts of problems at

would say. Stephen Snr is always or somewhere in the background, at all
disappointed with that first dart. Jarrad Waite    Scott Waites, the
sixth seed, has had twice as many darts at a double. He has   twice
as money. But it's the ones you are England selectors, with his lovely

quarterfinals. Stephen can, I think, yes! Immense pressure from here on
Probably to prolong his place in the quarterfinals   yes!
The biggest win in Stephen
Bunting's life, and it comes courtesy of a stunning checkout
percentage   it's 61%. He's beaten Grand Slam champion, he's through
to the quarterfinals... Stef00, that    Stephen, that must
be the biggest win of your career so far. Yeah, it is. I'm playing
well at the moment, but to beat Scott Waites, a former with world
champion, it's unbelieve stkwhrfpblt you said after the
first round, you didn't care who you met. My goodness me, you proved
that tonight. If I played Ted Hankey, it would have been a tough
game. I knew what to expect. I knew if I played my top game, I'd be
hard to beat. You've been around for a while now, but today was the
first time we saw you produce your absolute A gsolute A gwhen you
needed it. I was happy with the performance. At the end of the day,
I've got the win, scraped over the line. I'll get back on the practice
board and be ready. A superb win for Stephen Bunting.
I'm sure there'll be a few celebrating in Liverpool tonight.
It doesn't always have to be fast and furious to get a place in the
final as lodge as you get there. Gary Thompson is a man some call
'The Recliner'. He did it his own way and booked a second successive
appearance in the quarterfinal. Funny old match. He won the first
seven legs without reply. Then Chucky Norris had five. He did
enough in the end. A really good performance. That's about as much
emotion as you ever get from Thomo   job done.
Now to two men, both of whom are in unchartered territory. Robbie Green
has never been in the second round before, but he's a hugely popular
figure and loads of people would love to see him do well. He's up
against Dean Winstanley, who's also not been here, because this is his
Lakeside debut year. He just about kept his emotions under control in
the first round. Would he be able to do the same today?
Are you ready? Ladies and From the jungle, welcome 'Kong'  
Over the top   ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Dean Winstanley!
Whoever said big men couldn't dance? Fantastic.
We'll pick this one up at the start of the fourth set. Dean Winstanley
is winning two sets to one. Your commentary from David Croft and
do you work out three or four different permutations in your mind
before you release a dart? No, I It's a practice thing. Maybe they
don't all practice things to that extent. I think Dean might be, if
do to brush up. The most bizarre place about that   He hit the
treble 20, then didn't know what to do. Surely he must have worked out
aiming for, yes. Really bizarre. Like I said, it's really easy when
we sit here. Albeit you make it look quite easy when you stood up
lead tops. Bizarre. Let's see if he up his mind!
He went for the bull! That's might as well take it out.
you've got a double, go for it, today, though, was Gary Robson, who
went single 17, single 14, double top to take out 71. But he was
standing on one oche and throwing to the board on his right. He does
like to practise his exhibition shots, Gary. Pretty to watch.

what's left, or what you've scored. The referee can't tell you which
way to go, and just gives you the coming back from a three sets to 
one deficit, Martin. I'm inclined to agree. At this stage, Robbie's
scoring has not been consistently great. Getting by, at times.
  the 180s and the 140s are making positions when Dean has miscounted,
to take advantage of those was playing tonight at the Castle
Club, he would be OK and wouldn't have these problems. I guess not.
But he seems to cope OK on the not making it comertable, but it is
very comfortable for Dean heat up there at the moment. It

   suffering a touch up there. Physically, anyway. Dean Winstanley
is putting the mental struggles on himself. True. But we wouldn't want
Barry to put a damper on it. brother. They say Dean is the
he was going for. Indecision for Winstanley, the fact that he
hasn't got a 180 and rather likes to thrive on celebrations... It's
not helping, is it? It isn't, no. He's making a lot of errors on the
finishing. I mean, with the last shot there   11 first dart was
really a very, very loose dart. He's only got himself to blame for
putting in big enough scores to stay well ahead here. Robbie Green,
I think, has given this leg up. He wanted 138 in the last leg, and
didn't get it. 98 now   looking you go. No doubting the double top
the tops. There you go. Robbie Green hasn't hit it in 10 attempts.

been a bit shaky on and off all the Winstanley family. His sister all  
was going   much closer to the double. Winstanley now for double
That could be a very key break of throw. Cos now, Winstanley is one
little bit here and he can step in, hit the big score, get in front and
take the leg. A bit of a lucky break with that first dart for
Winstanley. It was over the top of the bed and made it hard for the
