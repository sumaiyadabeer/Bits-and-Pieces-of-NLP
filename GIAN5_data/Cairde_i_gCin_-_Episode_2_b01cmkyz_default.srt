  Sarah.
  Hello!
That's great for my day.
Brisa? Eh...
  Did you start that wall?
  Yeah.
Woah. Ho ho ho...
  You can't start it, Lucinda.
  Why?
  Where's your line?
He told me to stay going.
  Cos he said it was dry.
But that's for the build.
You always start the corners and then they put a line
and you carry on from the line. But you don't start it.
< They're here.
  They got lost.
  We didn't.
We followed the boy and we told him we had to go to the church.
We drew pictures of churches on his hand.
  Diarmaid was looking for us.
  We were leaving our DNA around here,
though, just in case so they'd know we were here last!
Yeah, we knew...
OK, well...
Just make sure it's not ditching the line in here...
Ciao!
A connection.
So all going good so far. I got the stitches out today,
so I just have them covered up today and tomorrow, and then all healed.
Don't go there.
He wants to sit on your shoulder.
Daddy...
They're going on about the football match the whole time now,
so we'll see how that goes. They seem more worried this year than other years.
I can't wait. It's going to be brilliant.
I'd love to just get one up on them.
They've been laughing at us on site,
but if we were to wipe them off the pitch, it'd be great. I'd love it.
Morbid point at the end!
Brazil, Brazil!
We're all playing in Brazil!
I suppose I learned to appreciate things more.
You have things very easy at home, compared to here.
I am sad the whole thing has come to an end,
but I'll get my curry cheese chip when I go home now and I'll be grand!
