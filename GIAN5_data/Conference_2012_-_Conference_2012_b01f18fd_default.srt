Good afternoon and a very warm welcome to our live coverage of the
Scottish Conservatives' conference in Troon. The party faithful are
gathering in the courtroom. We will hear from Ruth Davidson making her
first conference speech as leader. She would say there will be no
compromise with the SNP in the battle to keep the union. With me
in the studio is Professor John Curtice and our man beside the
seaside is Brian Taylor, our political editor. Thank you for
joining me. This is Ruth Davidson's maiden speech to conference. I
suppose we are expecting a stout defence of the union again. I think
we are. She has picked a lovely place for it. That is Troon harbour,
we have planes flying above and bobbies on bikes. We've even got
police horses but in terms of transport, the path ahead for Ruth
Davidson is definitely Scotland staying within the Union. Thank you
very much. John Curtice, 12 months ago, Ruth Davidson didn't even know
she was going to be elected as an MSP and now she is speaking to the
conference. It has been a major effect rise. F    a meteoric rise.
The financial allegations made to the person who was number one long
does the's list, it meant Rees became a number one and became a
elected leader. The other thing we are looking for his have defect   
her defence of the union but also her road map for the party is
Gordon. What does she regard her as her priorities? She is quite a
radical right wing politician. She has some very clear views that
Scotland's public services should be delivered a very different from
the way they are at the moment. True might be used to tourists but
this weekend, the Tories had descended. They have turned up to
hear the Prime Minister launched a robust defence of his party's
values and argued it was time to take the fight to the nationalists.
For the Tories, the last few elections have seen few successes
so time to change technique. One person certainly thinks so. Let's
be frank, we aren't will be one to be in Scotland. We are nowhere near
it. There are those who think this is just a fact of life, that a
small Conservative presence north of the border is inevitable. I am
resolutely not one of those people. I am here today to argue that this
could be Alamo rent. If we are bold enough to come back stronger.   
this could be Alamo and. This is a nation founded on thrift and graft,
paying your way,. There is a profound belief in personal
responsibility. And there is a passionate belief in family,
community and country. For Conservatives looking at these
qualities, looking at these values, it is like booking in the mirror.
They hour    they are our qualities and our values. He said they could
be proud of their message. More conservative. The time for timidity
is over. Enough of the hand  wringing and trying to be all
things to all people. Let's be clear about what we stand for and
what we won't put up with. suggested the Conservatives could
help their party by saving the union. We have led the SNP claimed
ownership of patriotism. But it is the symbol of a nation, not one
political party. You can be even prouder of your Scottish heritage
as of yore British heritage as many in Scotland up and still believe
that Scotland is better off in Britain. But he won't leave    lead
the Conservative campaign. The one and only Annabel Goldie. Thank
goodness we have found something for the old bird to do! I have to
tell you, ladies and gentlemen, there is no will to which I would
more readily put my shoulder and to keeping a school    a strong
Scotland within a strong Britain. Also lending their shoulders, a
line up of lords and ladies, friends of the Union. All of us,
Scottish, English, Northern Irish and Welsh, we need to show just
what this relationship means to us. And that Scotland is better off in
Britain and Britain is better off in Scotland. By driving through a
programme of separatism, saying we have to drag Scotland out and say
the Scottish identity into a place by ourselves, you are doing
violence to part of the identity of every Scotsman's. There is a
British component in the identity of every Scotsman and two separate
that or to try and bring about separation is to do violence to
people's own sense of identity and this is not a good thing to do in
any event. Controversial talk from the winner of a noble Pre's prize.
   a Nobel Peace Prize. Here, they used to make gun boats so it is a
fitting location for a party who says it is ready for the fight of
the future. It is one thing all this rhetoric, they still have an
awful lot of work to do to sweeten Let's go back to Professor John
Curtice from Strathclyde University and Brian Taylor beside the seaside.
Brian, some of the Tory press this morning were saying that the Prime
Minister gave the Tories quite a chiding because he was saying stop
the hand wringing and stop the timidity. What is your assessment
of the speech? No, not a chiding butts and exultation. I think it is
keeping with the approach that Ruth Davidson take. I believe that she
was encouraging him down that path. The path of saying that she, as a
young leader, does not remember Margaret Thatcher being in office.
It is time for the party and the Scot and, basically, to get over
that period and to think in a different way. I also agree with
John Kerr it is about the approach she would take two policies. I
think she would say that should there be substantial tax powers,
once those tax powers of through and in place for the Scottish
Parliament, she will be in favour of cutting income tax in Scotland.
If you think that the logic of the Conservative position it is only
with substantial powers in the Scottish Power's, Ace of sexual
ground upon which to play that you can credibly    a substantial
ground on which to play that you can credibly argue for lowering tax.
This was the big appeal, trying to attract Scots who might be
interested in the centre right policies, but they just can't reach
out and get the support, can they? They can't. I think the Prime
Minister's prescription was very good. It is often argued that
Scotland is so much more left wing than England and this is the reason
why the Conservatives can't prosper. But the truth is it is something of
a myth. If the look at opinion surveys, Scotland is a little bit
more left wing than Scotland but only have a bit more, about 5% more.
However, the problem for the Conservatives is that even those
who are on the Centre Right and the right in Scotland are much less
willing to vote for the party north of the border than there are south
of the border. The reason seems to be because those who indeed
primarily feel Scottish, those who wanted a Scottish Parliament that
is strong, for the moment, they eschew the Scottish Conservative
Party. I think the challenge for Ruth Davidson is that if she wants
to defend the Union on the one hand and be sceptical about more power
to Scottish Parliament but at the same time wanting to attract people
on the Centre Right, is can she bring those two things together.
The position on the union and their perception of being an England
party seems to cuts across. That sounds like a difficult balance to
strike. Can a parties campaign to fight for the union means they will
attract more support? What the are trained to do, they have declined
over an extended prolonged period because they were seen increasingly
as being other than Scots, they were seen as primarily an English
party. It was complete therefore best prospects in Scotland. They
were brandishing patriotism, a branch in the Union flag. They
picked the wrong patriotism. Or the Prime Minister was saying is stress
the Scottishness and argue from the union but argue from a very much
Scottish position. And the PM also said that he seems to argue that
the campaign for the union, it will invigorate the Tories themselves.
He believes as a consequence of that, with that reinvigoration,
they can start campaigning on issues like the economy and society
and perhaps then, they can reach out to Scottish people. In other
words, you have to get past the obstacle of being seen as other
than a Scottish party and then perhaps, you'll get a hearing for
the other issues that the Prime Minister was arguing should be
advanced. Now, a debate on the constitution is going on in the
hall in Troon. Let's cross live there and listen in. As part of
this partnership, we are the 7th wealthiest nation on earth. We can
play a major role in the future developments of mankind on a global
stage and also, even with one of the worst global recessions ever
and 13 years of Labour rule, we are still in a position to look to
prosper and grow. In short, we are stronger together and weaker apart.
That is why we all need to go out from this hall today and make that
positive case for the union and continue our pledge for a
resounding and unwavering support Thank you. I would like to ask Paul
bordering    Paul Gordon from the British Conservatives in Madrid and
Alex Fergusson SNP to speak. Thank you. I spoke before. I will come
back on. I would just like to support the words given up by our
colleague from Renfrewshire. I really think we have to cut Alex
Salmond down to size. We cannot underestimate what he is trying to
do. It is a real, real campaign based on lies and manipulation. He
is trying to brainwash the Scottish people and he's a very canny and
shrewd man. I met him years ago at a debate when he was a lot thinner
and I was as well. And he really caught my attention because he does
have a lot of political capacity. We must not underestimate him or
his stooges, to use that word, the apostles of division and hatred,
this is really sad. When I am asked about this in Spain by Spanish
people, they ask me, what is happening in your country? Has
Scotland been, has it had such a bad deal out of Great Britain? They
are really quite surprised. Spain is going down a similar story, of
course. And for that reason, as Mr Stevenson said, the Spanish
government is looking at this story with great preoccupation because
Catalonia and the Basque country are in a similar situation, if not
even worse. And I would like just to say that we must cut Alex
Salmond down to size. We live in a democracy and we cannot allow him
to spend taxpayers' money as if it was bred falling from heaven. He
must be cut down to size. One of the debates. We will be going back
to that shortly when the Home Secretary Theresa May will be
speaking. Yesterday, the Prime Minister gave a rallying call to
the faithful in the party and said he will fight for the party with
everything they have. The speech began with an admission that it
wasn't always been easy being a conservative in Scotland. We walk
taller, we shout loud together. That is why I say not only can you
love Scotland and love the United Kingdom, not only can you drive
yourself in both flags, but let me say this, you can be even prouder
of your Scottish Heritage then you're British heritage, as many in
Britain are, and still believe that Scotland is better off in Britain.
All of this is why this Prime Minister and his party is going to
fight for the United Kingdom with So I am eager that the hold of that
debate, we put that question, we make that decision. But do you know
the big roadblock standing in the way of this referendum? It is the
man who has been calling for it for decades! At the last election, Alex
Salmond asked for a mandate for a vote on independence. He won that
election, he got back mandate, I have offered him his referendum,
but now he will not take it. What on earth is going on? First he
wanted a referendum in 2010, now he says he needs 1000 days. First he
said he wanted one question, now he is after two. Now he is talking
about Deval Max Audie vote Plus, soon it will be due for the sequel.
I thought we were meant to be watching the movie Braveheart, it
turned out it is a chicken run! What is he waiting for?
He says he wants to know when a more devolved powers are on the
table. But no one can appear at    accuse me of being pragmatic   
dogmatic. In the Scottish bill, we have a huge transfer of fiscal
powers. Indeed, the proportion of the budget that can be raised in
Scotland by more than double. This week, we have reached agreement
with the Scottish Government on further issues they wanted
reflected in the bill. So this is a bill, delivered in Westminster by a
Conservative prime minister, supported by the Scottish
Government, consented to by the Scottish Parliament, I promised
respect and that is exactly what we are giving. Scotland's two
governments and to parliaments working together. Beyond this, I am
open minded about the transfer of more powers, as long as those
powers are truly about improving the lives of people in Scotland and
not just bargaining chips in some endless game of constitutional
poker. But all of these are principally questions for after
the referendum. The people of Scotland were promised at a clear
choice. Yes or no. In or out of the United Kingdom. And that is exactly
the clarity they should get. Delay creates uncertainty, for businesses,
investors, families. People need to know one way or the other. So why
message to the First Minister is this: stop dithering and start
delivering. Let us give the Scottish people the chance to make
a clear choice about their future. In that campaign, I want
us to demonstrate that this is a party with a proud, patriotic
message. Scottish and British. But our long term future depends on
much more than that. It depends on showing how our values canned make
for the values of Scotland. I see no reason at all why a party that
is moderate, sensible, centre right, cannot represent millions of people
in Scotland. This is a nation founded on the virtues of thrift
and graft. Of paying your way and not running up debts. There is a
profound belief in personal responsibility that its Scottish
workers through the snow and into work on a winter morning. There is
that buccaneering spirit. There is that passionate belief in family,
community and country. For Conservatives looking at these
qualities, looking at these values, it is like looking in the mirror.
The art are qualities, our values. Yet let us face it, that is not how
many Scots think of our party. The pensioner in Yorkshire at votes
Conservative because he or she knows we will look after every
pound of taxpayers' money. But too often, the pensioner in Perthshire
with with the same belief in sound money, rejects us. The entrepreneur
in Birmingham backs us because we believe in lower taxes in
enterprise, but no one in Glasgow does not always do the same. The
mother in Suffolk likes our focus on building a strong, safe society
where built    children are brought up with the right values. So does
the mother in an this, but still there is something holding her back
in the ballot box. Some would say it is always going to be like this
so just get used to it. Icy it is time that we stood up even more
strongly,    I say it is time that we stood up more strongly for those
values we believe in. When you make a strong argument, people listen.
Those who agree will follow your lead. That is what we have done on
the question of the Union. For years, we shied away from the
subject, afraid of saying anything, worried it would be taken the wrong
way. No way, the Conservatives, are the ones on the front foot, asking
for the referendum, looking for that challenge. And although we are
just at the start of this journey, people are beginning to listen to
us. We needed to show the same fight right across the board on all
of the issues that really matter to the Scottish people. The economy
the work and, the opportunities for their children, the society 11.
People in Scotland deserve a real choice about these things, and that
should include sensible, practical, centre right ideas. And that can
only come from us. The time of timidity is over. Enough of trying
to be all things to all people. Let us be clear about what we stand for
and what we will not put up with. Let us take for instance our
message about fiscal responsibility out to this country. This is a
nation with prudence in its blood. Every sensible Scot knows that we
have to live within our means. The knows that there are no shortcuts
to get out of the mess we are run. Labour and the SNP are trying to
tap into this mood. They are beginning to talk the language of
austerity. But Askew, have you heard anyone from Labour or the s
MP ever asking for a sensible cut in anything? We have had the Celtic
Lion, the art of prosperity, but nothing about how we can live
within our means. So we have to be clear to the Scottish people. If
you care about dealing with the deficit, if you care about not
handing on debts to your children, there is only one party on your
wavelength and that is us, the Scottish Conservatives.
So let this be a challenge. Not just in the run up to these
elections but in the months and years beyond. To reach out and send
out a rallying cry across Scotland seeing to parents, who fear leaving
a legacy of debt to the next generation, we feel it too. You
have a home with us. To the young web entrepreneur who is desperate
to make money and to new jobs, we are behind you. You have a home
with us. To the pensioner who believes that a duty and decency
other pillars of our communal life, you have a home with us. To the
doctor, nurse, a teacher who want to have more say it on    in what
happens in the ward or the classroom, you have a home with us.
To everyone who wants more control over their lives and to
neighbourhoods, you have a home with us. To everyone who knows that
this is a great country but we have to work harder to make it greater
still, and to everyone who loves Scotland but loves the UK as well
for everything it can be in the future, come with us, join us, you
have a home with us. APPLES. That was the prime minister
speaking yesterday. Let us go back to Brian in Troon.
It is getting sunnier by the second. It is absolutely gorgeous. Three
Conservative activists have joined me. He is saying enough of the
hand wringing. Do you empathise with that? David Cameron made a
really great point about the strength of the Union in his speech.
That was great for everyone to see. He made a really good points about
why we need to keep Great Britain together. This point he is making
about standing up for conservatism, does that go with you? Absolutely.
There is no doubt that anyone who heard his speech yesterday knows
how passionate he is about keeping Scotland in the Union. But saying
it in that fashion, saying that if you are going to be a Tory, stop
apologising for it, does that echo what you? Yes. I think it is
important in Scotland for us to stand up for the principles we
believe them and to take those principles and positive stances and
create something people want to vote for. We have a great story to
tell and David Cameron put it across very well. One part was a
passionate defence of the Union and the second part was the things we
are doing, we have that Conservative Prime Minister and we
have just taken 2 million of the lowest pay two people out of income
tax. My apologies. We're going back into the conference will for
Theresa May.    conference hall.
Thank you very much. It is a real privilege to be able to join you
hear in Troon today. What a beautiful town it is. So typically
Scottish. I heard I hear hear it from over their! Stunning coastline,
friendly people and of course, a famous golf course. In so many ways,
it represents all that is special about Scotland. Whenever I visit
Scotland, I am reminded of the fighting spirit of the Scots. It is
indeed across the globe. You might have noticed that I am not Scottish.
But I have often observed how you receive a warm welcome wherever you
travel. It is one of many things to be proud of. And it is reciprocated.
When people visit the vibrant cities and put his gown at   
pretty towns, the spiritual Islands of this great country, a country
admired across the world, indeed, how many people abroad who have not
even visited the shorts would like to claim roots in Scotland? Your
country and its people are loved and admired and everyone wants to
be part of it. But the Scotland Bill of is part of a bigger hole.  
  the Scotland they love is part of a bigger hole. And I am here today
to talk about why it should stay that way. I want Scotland to be
part of the United Kingdom. I believe in the Union.
shared past, centuries of being together, the union for all its
history of up Sundowns is to be cherished. I have no doubt that
Scotland could survive outside the United Kingdom, but together we are
stronger. Stronger on the world stage, stronger in protecting our
sovereignty in Europe, stomping    stronger in our own communities and
stronger for recognising this. I am pleased to have this opportunity to
talk to you about the work I do and how it operates within the union
and why I believe that continued success is tied to the union. As
Home Secretary, I see every day how we work together for the good of us
all. Assured intent that unite us. Working together to protect our
borders, working together, protecting the country from those
who would seek to do us harm. I also want to talk to you today
about some of the myths that the SNP would have people believe.
Under what to start some debate over issues like Europe, a debate
that the SNP does not want you to have. I will not pretend that our
party is the most popular in Scotland. I will not pretend that
we do not have some way to go in asking Scotland to trust us again.
But we ought to look to the future and the uncertainty of the union
demands that we must. I believe that each and every woman and man
in this room has a part to play in started to make good progress.
There have been changes to the party in Scotland, of which we can
be proud. Your leader, at this Davidson, is a fresh talent.   
Ruth Davidson. We have had    we have seen gross in party membership
under her leadership. The new campaign will continue to yield
more to read the year. She has already become a powerful voice in
Scotland, making the arguments with passion and purpose. My friend
Annabel Goldie did so much for our party for so long and continues to
It is something of an understatement to say that you are
a tough act to follow. But Ruth is following in her own way with her
own style. She has hit the ground running in modernising the party,
said in a policy reviews and bringing people together. The
issues she faces as leader are not small as the party heads into local
government elections but under her leadership, I'm believe we are
making good progress. Like everyone in this room, she understands the
strength that comes from the union. Yesterday, the party launched its
friends of the union campaign and I look forward to helping in any way
I can. Under won's leadership, the party had the energy, the vision,
the will to win again and we can demonstrate that we are a modern,
relevant and powerful force in Scotland. And now, as the threat of
separation looms large, Scotland Now, the question over the future
of the United Kingdom cannot be taken lightly. And that is why it
deserves open and honest debate on a number of key issues. Don't be
fooled, conference, by the better end in SNP. The Scottish National
Party is not made up of nationalists. Nor should we see
them as portraitists. As David Cameron said yesterday, how dare
the SNP claimed patriotism for independence alone. Is not everyone
in this room a Patrick?    a No, the SNP are not nationalists,
they are separatists. Separatist like Alex Salmond one to duck for
be tough questions. He calls himself a social democrat but he
fails to deal with the many issues for democracy which arise from
being a separate Scotland. He calls himself a progressive but what is
progressive about breaking Scotland off from the rest of the United
Kingdom, then giving away powers to Europe? It completely defeats the
SNP argument that Scotland would fare better with more control over
its own affairs when they seek to handover so many serious areas of
government elsewhere. And people want to know, and they have a right
to know, what handing over those powers will mean. Maybe even a
joining the single currency. In the UK, we maintain control over our
borders. Joining Europe's area could open Scotland up to mass
immigration. In the UK, we have an opt out on justice and home affairs
matters. Almost certainly, Scotland would not have an opt out. All
serious issues with huge implications for Scotland. It is
unfair and it is undemocratic of Alex Salmond not to tell us how all
of this would affect Scotland. Now, let's take the issue of currency as
a case in point. Over the years, Alex Salmond has made the case for
Scotland joining the euro. Indeed, he did so with a passion for which
she is so well known. Nowadays, he has shifted his position. Now, he
says that an independent Scotland would retain Stirling. But that
doesn't really work either. Scotland were still find itself in
a currency zone in which interest rates are set elsewhere. All that
up he will, all that changed for no meaningful change at all.    All
that upheaval. There are of course occasions when the governments of
Holyrood and Westminster might take a different view on an issue.
Immigration is a policy area that is retained and for which I am
responsible as Home Secretary. However, the SNP and Labour believe
that all immigration is good. I don't agree. We need to reduce and
control immigration. For those who add value to our economy, the door
will always be open. Indeed, recent changes to the system we have made
make it easier for them to come. We won the brightest and the best,
those who will contribute to the economy to come to the UK. And of
course, we will always welcome those who generally seek refuge   
refuge from persecution. But under Labour, a net migration to the UK
number 2.2 million people, some of those will have settled in Scotland.
Understandably, some communities struggled with such rapid change.
They found that Labour's decade of mass mismanaged immigration policy
had a huge impact on public services like health and schools.
Indeed, a recent report which included Scotland carried out by
the migration advisory committee found evidence to suggest a
negative association between people coming to Britain from outside
Europe and British born employment during the past 15 years. It also
found that some potentially adverse impacts such as housing costs and
increased congestion in public transport are not easily absorbed.
And then, there is illegal immigration, sham marriages,
illegal working, people staying on with expired visas, in rooting out
illegal immigrants, they have been some success stories he is often.
The UK Border Agency's Glasgow team disrupted nine sham marriages in
Gretna this year. Earlier this month, the local immigration team
in Glasgow, accompanied by Strathclyde Police, addresses 11
suspected illegal entrants. We have made it our aim to get net
migration back down to the tens of thousands. Cutting immigration
isn't simple and it will take time. But we are taking action on every
route to the UK. And worst it isn't simple, it is vital, so don't let
Labour and the SNP tell you any Now, in being devolved, Scotland
has shown great success at managing its own affairs. As Home Secretary,
I have no say at all in policing in Scotland and I wouldn't want it any
other way. There are many differences in our approach to
policing. Scotland will have just one force, we in England and Wales
have 43. But I am always struck by how well the arrangement works. And
it certainly doesn't mean we don't talk to each other. In fact, the
opposite is true. Police forces, intelligence agency and immigration
officers work alongside each other on everything from cracking down on
illegal immigration to counter terrorism. The approach balances
the reserved nature of some of the work while recognising the devolved
nature of important aspects of its delivery in Scotland. But again, we
are stronger together. The threat from terrorism shows no regard for
boarders. On several occasions, Scotland has been on the forefront
of international terrorist attacks. When the bomb went off at Glasgow
airport, before resources of the UK state went into running down every
need. Extensive co operation between the UK and the Scottish
government has developed effective counter terrorism capabilities.
Working together, our governments have worked in preparation for the
Commonwealth Games in 2014. Scottish police forces and those in
England and Wales have been working closely to make this international
event safe and secure for all to enjoy. Indeed, a national counter 
terrorism exercise to test our preparedness in response to a
terror effect    terror threat to the 2014 games will take place next
year. And we all look forward to delivering a secure London 2012
games. And Glasgow, Hampden Park, that will be one of the venues. The
challenge of those games is immense. The Olympics safety and security
programme will probably be the largest security operation ever
taken in peacetime Britain. 10,500 athletes for the Olympics and over
4,000 for the Paralympics coming from over 200 countries. On the
busiest day, 800,000 live spectators. And a global TV
audience of up to 4 billion. And, by the way, 21,000 journalists,
twice the number of athletes! And every one of them looking for a
story. But with those 4 billion television viewers all around the
world, all the eyes of the world will be upon us. Regardless of
where you come from in the UK, we will be seen as British. Working
together, we are fighting the scourge of international terrorism.
Working together, we are busting the international drug barons that
ruin our communities, rip families apart and ravaged the lives of so
many. Working together, we can look to the future as a United Kingdom.
We are sending out the message that if people wish to threaten our
security and way of life, then, we stand ready together to do all we
can to stop them in their tracks. There is indeed more that brings us
together than tears us apart. A future in which Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland and England continued to flourish side by side
as equal partners. Different and Different and proud to be so.
Surrey, did you say I should have whisky in this?    sorry. Moving
forward together, we know what we are worth and will go out and get
what we are worth and we will do it together and that is how we will
win. And that is progressive. Conference, I believe in the Union.
We believe in the Union. So, let's see that famous Scottish fighting
spirit out there on the doorsteps The Home Secretary Theresa May
being applauded by the people in the hall. Joining me his Professor
John Curtice of Strathclyde University. A very interesting
point that was picked up in a few of the papers today, her warning
about mass emigration to Scotland. Indeed, and that fitted a wider
theme in the speech. The argument is that Scotland, as part of the
United Kingdom, is better against threats from elsewhere. So, yes, in
part she was talking about immigration. She was also talk
about Europe, the single currency, also talk about terrorism and drugs.
These are all apparently external threats. She is trying to argue
that the union is better capable of defending Scotland from these
threats than Scotland is on its own. Some have the points will be
disputed. For example, the fact that UK is part of this agreement
has little effect. People have an agreement across the union
irrespective of having to show a passport or not. So whether
Scotland would end up with more people coming to this country from
Poland or other parts of eastern Europe,, frankly, it is irrelevant.
I things another points will be disputed. It is interesting to look
at some for points. The one to defence Scotland against some of
these threats, you need to keep the year. Had you think her speech goes
down to a Scottish audience? There was polite applause. Mass
immigration isn't really issued issue in Scott and. It is certainly
true that immigration from outside the European Union, Scotland has
had far less of that. Of course, is also true, and she was partly
alluding to this that Scotland's politicians, Scott and needs more
in the way of immigration in order to get the age balance in the
population. Ironically, we have seen the birth rate increase in
Scotland and we are getting a natural increase in population. So,
some of the requirement for extra immigration has dropped. But
certainly, Scotland, in a sense, existing in this context, and also
some of the arguments about whether immigration is a good or bad thing,
the tone of that debate has been somewhat different than for certain
Alex Ferguson said the case for it    said it is impossible to
campaign against separation without explaining the consequences to the
Scottish people of rejecting independence. There is no doubt
that the pace of the debate since the New Year when the Government
announced its you on the legality of a bill on independence, and its
conclusion that a further transfer of powers was required to give the
Scottish Parliament the legal comes    legal competence to enact such a
measure. The interesting thing is that when it comes to this crucial
question, the SNP actually agrees that it meets    needs that
transfer of powers to enable such a stark choice to be put to the
Scottish people. Accordingly, why is it, you may ask, but since the
turn of the year there has been more discussion about a second
question then there has about the consequences and implications of
independence itself. No one has more to say on this subject then Mr
Salmond, whose attention should be focused on independence, of which
is after all the reason of existing up for his party. There is a
fundamental difference between independence and devolution, up
between sustaining a union and the break up of Britain. Separation is
a fundamentally different proposition from any scheme of
devolution, and that is the question which needs to be answered
above all else and before all else. In my opinion, some proponents of
different models of devolution are playing with fire if they seek to
introduce the second questions or multiple choices into the
referendum. Wittingly or unwittingly, we're playing Alex
Salmond's game because this simply deflects attention from the main
area should and they should be wary of getting their fingers burnt.
can be no coincidence that in a recent poll, at 8% of undivided   
undecided at voters said they would vote No to independence if they
knew that the pilot was to get for their powers and they knew what the
powers were to be. There is one very good reason to understand what
those powers would be in the event of a no vote. I do not think that
is a good enough reason. And no vote in the referendum is surely
what we all want, it is certainly what we all work for, and if this
is achieved, as I believe it will be, independence will be off the
agenda. But I ask you for how long will that be the case. It would be
until the next majority SNP Government is elected to Holyrood
and a new tranche of the SNP backbench fundamentalists have to
be mollycoddled by their leadership. I want an outcome to all of this
that knocks independence of the agenda, not just for the next five
or 10 years, but maybe for a century or more. The prize for all
of this if we get this right is the creation of a long term,
sustainable constitutional structure that was a queue at of
all its    devolved Scotland within the United Kingdom for several
generations to come. I simply do not believe we can achieve that
without considering and laying out our plans for the further
devolution of powers from Westminster to Holyrood. Alex
Ferguson there. Let us speak now to David Mundell. He is standing by
the seaside in at Troon. I just wanted to get up on one or two
points about Theresa May's speech there. She was saying that
independence could open up Scotland to mass emigration. Do you really
need these scare stories to try and keep the union? They are not scare
stories. We're trying to move the debate on about independence and
get people addressing the issues that Scotland will face if we
separate from the rest of Britain. There has been no such sensitive
discussion today about issues like immigration, membership of    our
membership to the heat    to the EU, how we will deal with the terrorist
threat, these are substantial issues that need to be debated so
that people know what the position is if Scotland were to be separate.
We have heard nothing from the SNP of the detail of was separation
will mean and that is our challenge to them cute    a challenge to
them: come and show us what a separate Scotland will look like.
What currency will use? How will the deal with international
terrorist threat? This could be a rather self defeating argument,
because that she says that Scotland will have to relax border controls,
the same could equally apply to England and Wales. The position is
that as a member state    that a member state of the EU has never
broken up before in the way that the SNP are proposing to break up
Britain, so they do not have the answers to these big questions.
now there do you.    needed to you. I am not making the case for
Scotland to be broken out of the rest of Britain. I want things to
carry on as they are. I think Scotland has a good deal with in
the UK, a good deal within Europe, I think Scotland is protected from
international threats because it is part of the UK. I am not making the
case for Scotland to be separate. The SNP are, it is for them to
answer these questions as to what as separate Scotland would look
like. Theresa May was trying to point out that mass emigration has
had a huge impact on public sector has Mac public services. This kind
of top does not go down well in Scotland.    of torque. I think
people are concerned to understand what will happen in a separate
Scotland on big issues like immigration and whether people in
Scotland will require a passport to go to other parts of the United
Kingdom, what our relationship with the EU will be. A lot of these
issues have not been discussed in Scotland because we had been part
of the United Kingdom. They will become issues if we are a separate
Scotland. It is now at that time for the SNP to set out clearly what
a separate Scotland will look like. Let us move on to what the Prime
Minister was saying    saying yesterday. If you are the party's
sole MP. Did you feel the party was chided by the Prime Minister for
poor performances over the past 20 years? We all recognise in the
Scottish Conservative Party that we have to do better and we have this
capacity to do better. We have a new, young leader who is
revitalising the party organisation, announcing shortly some big changes
in policy. During our leadership election, we as a party as a whole
it recognised the difficulties that we have had and the issues we have
to face, but what the Prime Minister also said yesterday it was
that this fight to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom gives our party
here in Scotland are renewed sense of purpose. It gives us something
to be out there on the doorsteps campaigning on, and that is what we
intend to do. As the Prime Minister said, you are trying to attract
that mother in Angus, that entrepreneur in Glasgow, but how
can you realistically do that? Annabel Goldie put all our efforts
into trying to attract that support but it has not worked. One of the
reasons that it has not work    worked, is that a lot of people had
been voting SNP on the basis that they were pursuing Conservative
policies, policies like freezing council tax, police numbers, low
business rates, but what people are beginning to understand is that
voting SNP is not about getting policies delivered, it is about
breaking up Britain. That is one of the big message is that we want to
get over. If you what Conservative policies and you want to stay in
the United Kingdom, the way to do that is to vote Conservative.
Prime Minister accused Alex Salmond of dithering, of hold a referendum
in the autumn of 2014. If you read the Scotsman today, it seems that
the Prime Minister is willing to go for 2014 as long as there is only
one question. Is that true? We want the legal, fair and decisive
referendum. The sooner the better. Alex Salmond's whole reason has
been having a referendum on independence. Now he wants one in
2014 and has given it no substantive reason for why we
should    it should be delayed. All the procedures should be completed
by next autumn and we could have a referendum in 2013. He should get
on with it. We are ready. The Prime Minister has said it very clear
that we are up for this fight, let's get on with it and end the
uncertainty and to know whether it Scotland is to be part of Britain
or is to be separate. What happened after the fight? I AM confused as
to what Ruth Davidson's line in the sand meant about new powers. As the
SNP said, it is quite a pig in a whole. What the SNP are offering is
a pig in a pork, because they are supposedly a party that wants
independence and now having never participated in the previous
constitutional commission, they are starting to bring on issues about
more powers, which they say they do not believe him. What we're done as
a Conservative Party here in Scotland is we have said that we
would deliver recommendations and that a Conservative Prime Minister
has delivered the Scotland Bill which will bring forward the
biggest transfer of financial powers to Scotland in 300 years.
But his David Cameron's record on devolution. The SNP have never been
previously interested in more powers. They say they are
interested in independence, if they are, let us have that referendum
and let Scotland decide. Do you think the Scotland Bill is a Trojan
horse? I think that the Scotland Bill is a well thought out piece of
legislation which will make the Scottish Parliament financially
accountable to the people of Scotland. When I served in the
Scottish Parliament, the issue was always the fact that the Parliament
was focused on how to spend money, it was not focused on how that
money was raised. This will make the Scottish Parliament more
financially accountable to the people of Scotland and I think VAT
is a significant change. But ultimately it is up to the people
in Scotland as to whether they want more powers for the Scottish
Parliament. David Cameron has said that he is open to more powers but
at this moment there is no proposal on the table for more powers. What
we want to do is get ahead, get the referenda out of the way, let the
people of Scotland decide and then at that time there will be plenty
of scope to discuss whether the Parliament should have other powers.
Thank you very much. The conference debate on the
economy was introduced as being even more important than
constitutional issues. Yesterday's session brought a mixture of
politicians and business people to the podium to argue the case for
tackling the national debt, reforming public services and
focusing on economic growth. Scotland's Corp    competition and
market place are global and so our benchmark must be global, and on a
global scale our economy is not performing. This is no surprise
with Scotland's public sector is so heavily weighted, and in Scotland's
funding and to deliver a models for public services are so centralised
and inefficient. This is no wonder when the current and previous
administrations in Holyrood have demonstrated so little strategic
ambition in investing in our infrastructure. The fix requires
bold vision, courage, and the willingness to put aside short term
political agendas and invest strategically for the long term. It
also means recognising that to compete in the global economy, size
matters. We should do everything possible to me for the numerous
advantages of being part of a strong United came does. In a
global world, that is the world will be all of them, independence
would mean economic suicide for Scotland. Ladies and gentlemen, I
support the motion. Thank you. I can only hope that the
British Government looks to more entrepreneur's for advice on to
help new businesses in ways other than simply providing funding. At
the end of the day, if our Government is trying to encourage
us to go out into the world and create an empire, they are not
supporting us to do so or giving us the relevant support and that can
only have a detrimental affect on the loyalty that youngsters feel
towards their Government. It is essential that the right people are
employed to award support and funding to future generations and I
sincerely feel that this needs to be looked at. The way that the SNP
are running things up here is simply not working for those small
and medium size enterprises that Britain is so keen to nurture. I am
now at this stage of opening her first shop, which is obviously very
exciting, not just because it will be my first job but because I can
finally pack in the restaurant job that I have had to keep myself
afloat for the last two years. I am very proud of all I have achieved,
however high have never considered myself to be an entrepreneur and
will be simply someone told me that this was indeed how he perceived me.
I told him I considered of    Richard Branson and not    that I
considered Richard Branson and entrepreneur. He said, you're still
in entrepreneur, it has not yet a successful one. However, I am only
25 and have plenty of time it to The fun    funding is crucial. At
me moment, the traditional engine for funding is not working, the
banks. 6.5% on overdraft to be reviewed every month and that from
a state supported bang. Finding suppliers is just as support and.  
  just as supporting    just as important. Much more focused
support is necessary if the potential contribution my
generation can make to our country's future can be realised.
Emily, I was listening carefully to your speech and I hope what was so
today it will be heard throughout Scotland. You made a strong and
clear message to the Scottish government. Let's not forget, and
this government went to get, that we all need entrepreneurs to get
growth. But we also need government to get behind those entrepreneurs.
Just look at the steps we are taking in Scotland, some of which
the Prime Minister mentioned earlier. Enhanced capital earners.
And the potential to deliver more jobs. As Alan mentioned, measures
that will stimulate billions of pounds of additional investment in
oil and gas. A huge boost for investment in the North Sea. Making
Edinburgh a super connected city, delivering ultra fast broadband and
high speed wireless connectivity. Corporation tax relief on video
games which will be particularly good news for Dundee and a tax
extension on the Commonwealth Games. But also, there are the steps we
are taking across the UK. In the teacher, in my area of tax. From
time to time, we receive representations from the Scottish
government that they would like corporation tax to be devolved.
They say that if they had power over corporation tax, they would
take great steps to make Scotland more competitive. The details, I
have to say, tend to be a little fuzzy. There is not much
information out how the tax would be collected or calculated would
stop they tend to brush over the fact that the overwhelming view of
business is that different corporation tax regime in Scotland
compared to the rest of the UK would create unwelcome
administrative burdens. And there is not a word about a cut    how a
cut in corporation tax would be paid for. A cynic might point out
that when the Scottish nationalists get their hands on a tax like
business like business rates, they are more likely to put it up, not
down. For some years, I have heard Scottish nationalists say that if
we had a corporation tax of 28%, the opportunities for Scotland
would be glorious. Well, when we came to power, corporation tax was
20% and we started cutting it, first to 26%. Next month, it will
be 24%. By 2014, it will be 22%, within sight of 20%. Thought 
through, costed and sustainable. This government is giving Scotland
and the whole of the United England    cannot    United Kingdom and the
competitive edge we need. I'd run a B&B and I have been nominated as
running the friendlies B&B in 2012.    friendliest. It does show that
even the smallest micro business can get recognition if you put your
mind to it. I would just like to end with a short quote. Someone
said to me earlier I should quote Churchill. I'm going to quote
Stanley Baldwin. A long time ago, I know. But just listen to these two
sentences. There are four words and one syllable, each are words which
contain salvation for this country. There are faith, hope, love and
work. And no government in this country today which has not faith
in people, hope in the future, enough for its fellow men and which
won't work and work and work will ever bring this country through to
better days and better times. Thank you, conference. It was the economy
debate in the true in all. We should cross there shortly before
Ruth Davidson's conference speech.    Troon. Ruth took over in
November. What progress have the Tories being making in the polls?
Clearly, there is a hope that with Ruth Davidson, the party would
indeed achieve progress, progress which has been entirely lacking
since 1997. The truth is that so far, there are any signs in the
opinion polls of this progress being achieved. Love for the most
recent opinion polls, as far as voting intentions are concerned,
the party is starting at 16%. In Holyrood, it is 13%. The truth is
that so far, the Conservatives in Scotland under Ruth Davidson's
Ladyship art in exactly the same large black hole they have been in
for some considerable time. The truth is that most people do not
yet know who Ruth Davidson his and have little ideas about her and her
policies. This morning's speech is important because it is a high 
profile event for her to try and get across to the Scottish public
who she is and what she stands for. Would you things and that consent
will be? She will be tried to explain who she is but what other
contexts might we be hearing? are two things to look out for. One
thing this party has the message on is that if you're going to sell
anything in Scothern, you have too rapid in the Saltire, not the Union
Jack. You have to be proud of the Saltire but still be part of the
Union. This argument that he wanted the Scottish is being commenced
that    commensurate with being in favour with the union is something
they will argue. We will see whether Ruth Davidson will put
flesh on that idea. What are the arguments as to why those who feel
strongly Scottish should be in favour of the Union? Why do the
correct Scottishness? Undoubtedly, Ruth Davidson is much more willing
than Annabel Goldie to embrace some of the ideas that using much more
of a market approach to the delivery of public services. I'll
be interested to see whether she repeats things she said earlier
this month about, for example, adopting the policies of free
schools, of greater involvement of the private sector in the delivery
of the Health Service, something which has proved extremely
conservative    extremely controversial south of the border.
We also accept it is there something about although she may be
reluctant to    for the Scottish Polla to have more power, it looks
as though she might be saying that if they do get these powers, we
indeed may be interested in using those powers to reduce the level of
income tax in Scotland. You may have heard David ducks say what is
the point of tax bias because we are already delivering lower
corporation tax. But Ruth Davidson might say that they should campaign
on the basis of having a lower income tax in Scotland will adopt
we are going to the hall very shortly in Troon. They are playing
Abdo to introduce her. There is Theresa May, the Home Secretary
going to introduce her. She is taking to the steps now. She will
introduce Ruth Davidson, the new Tory leader. Ladies and gentlemen,
our Prime Minister David Cameron, the Cabinet, we all know what a
fantastic job Ruth Davidson has been doing as your leader. Just
look, in the last few weeks, she has pressed for city status for
Perth, she has pressed for tax breaks for, what game athletes and
for support for the computer games industry. I can tell you
unreservedly that Ruth Davidson is fighting Scotland's corner. Ladies
and gentlemen, please welcome the leader of the Scottish
I think you left your whisky! Actually, it is pretty good! Good
afternoon, conference. Hasn't it been a fantastic weekend. Hasn't it
been so fantastic to see the support we have from the four
corners of our United Kingdom. To see proper debate back at
conference. To see so many MPs and ministers, cabinet ministers
joining us here in Troon. And of course, a man who is a true
supporter of our party in Scotland, our cause here in Scotland, our
Prime Minister, our Conservative Prime Minister at David Cameron.   
High Mr David Cameron. More than that, it is fantastic to see a
party that has renewed, reinvigorated and up for the fight
ahead. A party that is changing with its eyes firmly fixed on the
future and all that it can bring. As our mission is about more than
simply restoring the electoral fortunes of these cottages
Conservatives, although there is our goal. More fundamental, it is
to reclaim the voice for mainstream Scotland. When you are elected me
leader of our party, I promised root and branch reform, Eira    I
promised reform in the way in which we operate and how we communicate.
That reform is well under way. Of the aged recommendations put
forward by the Sanderson Commission and adopted by our party, 73 have
been completed or are in the presence of completion. We have a
new structure at the top, new ways of speaking with members and a
recruitment drive is seeing results. In the last four months, our
results have gone from fewer than 9,000 paid up members to more than
I played a greater role for that membership in the determination of
policy and they promised to bring back proper debate within our ranks.
From the robust such as we have seen this weekend, it is pretty
clear there is no shortage of opinion. That is the way it should
be. But it is not enough. Two further drive forward our policy
review, I am announcing the membership of our new board.
Journey on our border will be Stewart Stevenson, Scottish Lynsey,
John Lamont and one about best known and committed campaigners Ian
McGill. We are conducting the coldest review of our policies
since devolution. We have groups representing the business
communities and rural interests, teachers, professionals, and with
communities the length and breadth of Scotland. This is no small body
of work and it will feed into the board. We will be there to listen,
to listen to you at conference, to listen to our policy reviews, to
listen to expert opinion across Scottish public life, to learn from
across the world what can work better here in Scotland. And
together, we will build a set of policies that meet the challenges
of our age and which reflect the aspirations of the modern Scott and.
There are several further reforms in which power NUM members will
play a central role. I want to share them with you today. As we
map out a fresh and positive direction for the concert    for
the Scottish Conservatives, we must match that with a fresh and
positive image for our party. So, this will be the last Scottish
Conservative conference where it will be    where we will use our
existing branding. Will consult with you on proposals for our
dynamic new logo and image. Secondly, to be sure we're in the
best shape to fight elections, counsel, European and Western and
parliamentary, we will be consulting on the future structure
of our grass roots organisations. We must be a campaigning forced to
better deliver our message and nannies to be at the core of all we
do and how we shake ourselves. Thirdly, we must review our
candidate selection as a ranking process for Holyrood. We must make
sure that all the talented people in our ranks can play their full
part as we take a party forward. To help these me    to help me in
these areas, I can think of no one loves the party will, no one who
more appreciate the strength we have and seize the opportunities of
what we can be, then our party's deputy leader Jackson Carlow and I
have asked him to take the lead on these issues. Jackson, we are right
And on the issues that mattered to Scotland, there will be debate,
there must be robust debate, because politics is not about cosy
consensus on every issue is, it is about a class of    clash of ideas.
We will reach out to reconnect with that the thousands of people who
share our values but have stopped voting for us, or perhaps never
have. We will not get our support from hiding our light under a
bushel, by saying nothing to offend, by apologising for being
Conservatives. No more shy Tories, we must never be afraid to speak
out. I There are moments in history when it falls to a group
of people to take a stand. If to say what they believe in with
conviction, with passion, with right on their side. To know that
however allowed to their detractors will try to shed them down, they
will not be diverted from their course. Knowing that they speak for
the silent majority of the fellow men and women and that they shall
prevail. Conference, this is our town, a moment, our duty and a
column. Let me repeat what I told you last night. The next 1000 days
will shape the future of our country for ever. This is a battle
that we must win and that be will win. We will settle the separation
question. That question of separation is the elephant in the
room that is dominating Scottish politics. Often to the exclusion of
everything else. We have an SNP that is so obsessed with separation
that it is abdicating its responsibilities to the job it was
elected to do. On the day went youth unemployment figures crashed
through the 1000 barrier, the highest Scotland has ever seen,
where was the First Minister? Not at his desk, but down south at the
London School of Economics agitating for the job that he wants,
President of a separate Scottish state. That was bad enough but it
gets worse. All around Scotland, he is letting people down. Yesterday,
in this poll, we held    heard from Emily Lamb, at great example of the
bright young entrepreneurial talent every country needs. She told us
that she was frustrated and felt let down by our devolved Government.
As she put it, the way that the SNP is running things up here is simply
not working for the small and medium sized enterprises that the
United Kingdom is so keen to nurture. Alex Salmond, get back to
your desk and get on with the job if she were elected to do.
It is not just Scottish business that is being ignored, abandoned
and neglected. It is the people of Scotland and the public services
they are reliant. This week, I spoke to a young man who e mailed
me about the desperate need fought our cancer ward in Scotland. He
says, I lost my mum in 2001 to cancer. Watching someone so full of
life   it was painful to watch. How the    her death has had a profound
effect upon the and that is why I joined Cancer Research UK, so I can
make sure that no one again will have to make sure    will have to
go through what my mum went through. I believe that with the greater
availability of cancer drugs, my mother would be here today.
Scotland has a poor record when it comes to cancer and the need
radical change. I believe that this change can come from a cancer drugs
fund. Those are the words of a 17  year old boy who is desperately
hard time and working to make a difference. He has been let down.
We cannot allow others to put the future of their country on hold
whilst they pursue their own agenda. So Alex, get back to your desk and
get back to the job that you were elected to do. I wish
that these were isolated cases, but they are not. The SNP's eye is of
the ball. It is as if they do not want to use the powers they have
got because it would prove that they have far more powers to use.
Take justice. There has been some progress    progress, largely due
to the extra police that we delivered, but there is still so
much to do. Five years after coming to power, and still no action from
the SNP on ending the automatic early release scheme, which under
the nationalists has freed nearly 35,000 convicts from Scotland's
jails after serving just half of their services. That is 35,000
criminals freed and able to commit more crimes, create more needless
victims, when they should still be bought locked up for public safety.
Surely the SNP have taken a more robust approach to community
sentencing? Let me tell you the facts. Nearly one third of the
SNP's community pay back orders are opposed with no work reply it   
work requirement whatsoever. Half of supervised attendance orders are
breached by those serving them. So that is the SNP's approach to
sentencing. If you're convicted you will serve on behalf of your
service. If you're given a non  custodial sentence, there is every
chance you will never have to do a day's work to pay back to society,
and if you preach these terms, do not worry, the SNP have abolished
short term prison sentences. Conference, the SNP stands guilty
without the criminal neglect of our justice system. They are guilty as
charged. It is time for sentences to mean what they say.
For five years to mean five years. For 10 years to mean it tenures. In
Scotland we need a whole life order, because sometimes life should mean
exactly that, life in prison with no chance of ever being released.
That is what I mean about dividing lines in politics. And let us look
at child care. The SNP say they what provision to rise to 600 hours
per year. Fine words, but let us look at their actions. We have
heard it all before. Five years ago they promised a 50% rise in child
care and respect was five years failing to deliver. During that
time, the number of pre school places has dropped each and every
year. A quarter of registered creches have closed in the last two
years alone. In Scotland's classrooms, there are nearly 4,000
fewer teachers then when the SNP came to power and one and five
newly qualified teachers find themselves without a job. Alex, get
back to your desk, get back to you work and do the job you were
elected to do. Because one thing is now abundantly clear.
For the separate us, there is only one game in town. As we look
forward to may's elections, we know what that game is. We have seen it
before. They will pretend it is all about local issues for local people,
this from a nationalist party that wants to centralise everything. But
as soon as the if    as soon as the votes are counted they will claim
that every ballot is a cast iron vote for separation, because the
nationalists only have their eyes on one prize. They do not want a
better Scotland, just a separate Scotland. So to our local council
candidates, I say this. Call for would confident that we will settle
the question and that we are the true party of localism and real
devolution. Devolving power from Holyrood to people and communities
across Scotland. This is another fundamental dividing line between
the Scottish Conservatives and their opponents. They want to
gather more power in the hands of the few. We want to deliver power
into the hands of the many. So vast reseated delivered evolution at
local level, it is us, at the Conservatives, who are delivering a
further devilish and now for the people of Scotland. The Scotland
Bill will soon bring the biggest transfer of fiscal powers to
Scotland since the creation of the United Kingdom. New powers of a
stamp duty, at landfill tax, income tax. We must focus our attention on
using the powers we have and the new powers that are coming to build
a better Scotland. While the new tax powers are still some time away,
now is the time to think about how they can and should use to. As
Conservatives, our view is clear. To cut the tax burden faced by
individuals and businesses. Leaving more money in the pockets of Scots.
Encouraging more businesses to expand to create more and better
paid jobs in every corner of the country. Clearly, the scope for
cutting income tax will depend on the economic climate and the state
of public finances. But let there be no doubt, lowering the overall
tax burden is our ambition. A dividing line between Conservatives
to trust people to spend more of their own money to grow the economy
and the others who do not. Sono Alex, it is not a penny for
Scotland, it is pounds for people's pockets and that is the
Conservative way. APPLES. applause. We are building a party
that is brimming with new talent and fresh ideas. We are ready,
willing and able to tackle the new issues facing Scotland. We will
never face sight of the here and now. We know that there is no more
important issue than Scotland's continued place within the United
Kingdom. Our position is clear. We are for the union. Scotland is
better off in Britain and we do not Defence Scotland's place in the
United Kingdom by compromising with the forces of separatism. So no red
ballots and no second questions. A clear choice for at the people of
Scotland. In or out of the Union. I United Kingdom or a separate
Scotland. It is a choice that the Scottish people must be given as
quickly as possible. Delayed damages business. More and more
people are asking the question, why the delay, Alex? What is going on?
I will tell you what I think. Ego before party, party before country.
There is a growing army who do not agenda is to break up Britain be
working so hard to avoid putting a single, straight question to the
country? But that is not a Conservative Way. A legal, a freer,
decisive referendum. We must settle the referendum question    this
separation question. The The treaty of Union bind our
nations together and set them on a shared path which has endured for
more than three centuries. The United Kingdom is a shining example
to the world of estate that gathers together an array of nationalities
and peoples. Ours is an optimistic message. We support the Union
because Scotland's strings bolster those of the other nations within
it. It is about Corporation. It is about the whole being greater than
the sum of its parts. Giselle thick    celebrate the fact that our
identity is not rigid but is open for all to share them. The
diversity of the United Kingdom and the strength of the cultural
enrichment that we draw from that is what it make    what makes it
unique and to be prized. Breaking up the union would only serve to
narrow Scotland's ambitions. Embracing a British identity does
not will cost of one ounce of our proud Scottish us, it simply adds
an extra dimension to it. I union is a partnership. Our out looks are
not always identical, we sometimes argued and recognise the necessity
of compromise, but we know that we get far more from sticking together
than they would from standing apart. The ties that draw our nation
together are many and they have developed over time. For some, they
are deeply cultural. For others, they are a respect for the
institutions of our state, a monarch a, our armed forces. For
others they are economic. If we are rightly proud of the history of the
Union, it is to the future that we must raise our eyes. Scotland and
Britain is not an exercise in nostalgia. It is positive and
forward looking, together for good. It is about the way we interact   
interact with the rest of the world. It is about the advantages that
come from an integrated economy. The Solidarity we have through the
welfare state and the pulling of risks and rewards. To believe in
the Union of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, is not
an exercise in timidity, it is a statement of confidence that as a
nation Scotland Act should continue to play a role in the world beyond
our size and the number of our people. It is a belief that our
progress as a society is best served through continued
partnership with in our family of nations. That will be our message
over the coming months. To get that for good. Scotland is better off in
Britain. To those who want to break apart, I say, the respect of you
To supporters who accrued us, I say join us. We are positive that our
destinies are best served together, together for good. A strong
Scotland and a strong Britain. Pride in our past, faith in our
future and an unshakeable conviction that our best days still
lie ahead. Friends, I promise you that in our council chambers, at
Holyrood, at Westminster and in Europe, we will keep our eye on the
ball, fighting for a fairer deal, standing up and being counted on
the issues that matter day to day but equally, and this is my vow,
when it comes to the very future of the country that I laugh, I won't
falter. As Conservatives, where we need to lead, we will lead, where
we need to join, we would join, and where we need to fight, we won't be
found wanting. There are things that divide us but there are
aspects that can join us also. Scotland's calls is bigger than
anyone political party. So I say, Scotland expects us to work
together and we are. Scotland expects us to lead and we will.
Scotland expects us to put aside our differences and pooled together
for the common cause, to give a voice to the silent majority, to
build a chorus across a nation. Today, we stand on the brink of
history, the world is watching. This is a cause and we won't be
found wanting. We will add our sound to the millions of voices
declaring as one a strong Scotland in a strong Britain. Together, for
but. Conference, let's get to work. The Scottish Conservative leader
Ruth Davidson receiving a standing ovation in the hall at Troon after
her very first conference speech. She was introduced by the Home
Secretary Theresa May. Ruth Davidson are promised a new and
reinvigorated party. She said no more shy Tories. She accused the
SNP of taking the eye of the ball to focus on the referendum. He
promised a new Scotland Bill and Tories would cut taxes. She said
she was standing four square behind a union and that she would give the
boys to the silent majority the stop I am joined by Professor John
Curtice of Strathclyde University was stopped John, your immediate
reaction to that. Her first speech as they do. A rather surprisingly
short speech. I think, in some sense, it showed the difficulty of
the situation she has inherited. On the one hand, she has committed her
party to a policy review. At the beginning of this beach, we had
some detail about how it will be organised. That meant there was
very little about what is the current Scottish Conservative
policy and vision for the year. There was the idea that when
Scotland has its own income tax powers, a much reduce it. A strong
attack on the SNP's criminal  justice system. Still, with
relatively little on the domestic double to politics, despite a very
strong attack on the SNP for not paying enough attention to it. The
second thing maybe the most important message of the space. She
has inherited a situation where her party, together with Labour and
Liberal Democrats, are wanting to defend the Union. She was to be
combated but actually, she needs to become part of a wider pro union
organisation and the end of that speech was a very strong state and
that although she does have are differences with the Liberal
Democrats, she very clearly feels that her immediate objective is to
collaborate with the other Unionist parties to create a strong pro 
union campaign. She was saying that some of the party warfare will have
to be put on hold for a while in order to achieve this figure
projected. Achieve this bigger objective. She has given other
speeches in where we have a clear idea about the degree to which she
wants to change the Health Service and education. On the other hand,
still, nobody could get any doubt about her style. She clearly is say
to her party, we should not be timid. We should declare what we
stand for. We should go on the basis of that. I think all that it
is not necessarily clear from this speech, I think we're probably
anticipating that under Ruth Davidson, the Conservative Party is
probably going to move something to the right in Scotland. It will
occupy much more distinctive policy spaces with respect to have
Scotland should be run. She is someone who believes her party will
revive by not as it were going to was the centre of Scottish politics
and try to accommodate the new Conservative Party to the Scottish
electorate. Rather, her strategy will be to say firmly this is what
we believe in and by the way, we believe in different things from
both Labour and the SNP in Scotland. Although the star was there today,
I think the substance was missing because she is just about to go
through a policy review and this time this next year    this time
next year, we may get some more flesh on the bones. Just the very
beginning of the speech, it was parish pump stuff, to a
housekeeping duties. But you think that is significant. She is trained
to put her individual stamp on it. It is worth bearing in mind that in
the same way as the Labour Party leader John Lamont, that was a
change agreed before she became leader, equally, because it is
agreed that Annabel Goldie's successor would be the leader of
the whole of the Conservative Party has got and and she has inherited
that position. She is indeed responsible for running because of
a party in Scotland and I think undoubtedly, we are looking to see
what policies the Conservative Party is going to launch a loss of
the border. Certainly looking through the names of the people she
is going to look at, they are people who are known to be
associated quite closely with her. This is the policy board, the Ruth
Davidson wing of the party that is now firmly in control of his party.
She is selling her party members they can have the debate.    she is
telling her party members. Thank you. Let's go back over to Brian
for more reaction from the delegates in the hall. Thank you. I
am joined by Annabel Goldie, the Auld bird, as you describe yourself
last night. What did you make of your successor's speech? I thought
it was absolutely inspiring. I am not just saying no. It was full of
passion and purpose. She laid down a very clear message of what she
was to deliver and she also laid out the heart of what the
Conservatives believe is the United Kingdom. That will be the
touchstone for everything they are doing. There is this business about
that the Shaikh, did apologise, end the ringing of hands. What do you
make of that? They are saying the gloves are off. The battle lines
are drawn. People are coming up to me in the street saying, we want to
stop this independence drive, what are you doing about it? Both David
Cameron and won have Bradley said the moment is here,    both David
Cameron and Ruth have said the moment is here. I am a Scot who
sits for the Conservatives in Westminster. I am passionate about
defending the junior. The purpose is about getting jobs in Scotland
and getting people in Scotland back to work. We can only do that with
stability. Uncertainty over the future does not give us that
stability. A no compromise with the nationalists. How do you interpret
that? I interpret that as meaning they will be no compromise with the
nationalists. We are the premiere Unionist Party in a spot of. We
will work with other parties to ensure that the union is not broken.
You are say you are the premier union party? Isn't that they to
aggravate Labour and the Liberal Democrats and in the same breath,
you are calling them to work with you? I think they can make the same
claim I have made. If they are, they can show us how it is done.
You are asking Eddie joined you. this will be a campaign that is
genuinely across the parties. People across Scotland will be
invited to take part in that. We have to make sure this has got an's
campaign. Annabel Goldie, another big issue from Ruth Davidson. When
the tax part of the Bill is placed, when the circumstances are right,
she is talking about cutting income tax in Scotland. That could be
popular here but Mark's was it just aren't going to welcome that in
England. Already, the reality of devolution is that over a whole
range of things, with the powers that we have, we do things
differently. I think Mark and his colleagues in Westminster
understand that. That is the reality of devolution. The new
powers coming through with his got and built, I think they are very
important for the Scottish Parliament and will give it this
combination of not just responsibility for spending money
but some degree of accountability and responsibility for raising the
money, I think is an important discipline and that is what will be
interesting to see how some of the other parties like the SNP make of
that. Mark, how would you explain to your constituents south of the
border that the Scots can cut income tax? My constituents would
Tissier prospers    a prosperous got there. If we can see tax cuts
taking place that make saw that an attractive place for investments,
my constituents will welcome that. What we want to do is to be able to
make Scotland a haven for investments. Companies are worried
about coming to Scotland at the moan because they don't know what
Alex Salmond's plans are. We need to get that out of the way a get
jobs going in Scotland. That offer, essentially cutting taxation when
it is founded upon the taxation bill going through but the former
Secretary said that he regarded the Scotland Bill as a Trojan horse.
think the Scotland Bill is essential. We need is the ability
in Scotland. The problem for constituents south of the border
and their concern over spending is governed is they feel that money is
being spent here that it is not being raised here. That is not the
case. We need to be demonstrated more clearly. That is what the tax
changes in Scotland are all about. An inspired view. And a new logo,
as well? What would be your choice for a new logo? A tree? That is
putting me in the spot. I am not going to fall foul of my new leader.
These are important steps for the party to take. They will be
significant, not just for the negative. I thought the most
powerful thing she said the members was that unless you exist in a
campaign and advance the political arguments that we as Conservatives
believe in and show the dividing lines and the dividing line between
us and the other parties. She is saying it is moribund in some
areas? No, she is saying that the party needs to look at the whole
issue of political campaigning. We believe in different policies to
other parties, let's get out and sing that song lads and clear.
on this point of organisation, some would say it is shovelling the
chairs but do you think it is important? Yes, Scottish party is
not as strong as it used to be. We need to work together. Colleagues
south of the border like myself will be doing that. We need good
Scots coming forward and offering themselves for public service.
Don't leave it to someone else. If you are a conservative and you
think you can play a part, come forward and do it. On the same
point, candidate selection, she is obviously planning some big changes.
Yes, indeed. The fact that she thinks the big changes are needed
means she things there was a problem in the past. What is that
problem? The problem was that we were too conservative, we were
resistant to change. We are now adapting to the political party   
climate in Scotland. These changes mean we can go forward and engage
with a whole new generation of young Scots. These are young Scots
were here this week. We have thousands of new members playing
their role in that. Joss sticks burning, the helicopter above,
there is a demonstration organised and the helicopters are keeping an
eye on them and probably just as well. Now, during a debate during
energy policy, delegates had fully read and Westminster in their sides.
The stellar wind farm development across got and also came in for
I believe that the current construction of so many wind farms,
or onshore and offshore, is the most are seriously damaging and
destructive policy being inflicted on Scotland today. It is
a damaging policy for many reasons. Firstly, it damages our industry
where Claridge increases in the price of energy which threatens
competitiveness. We are in a delicate economic recovery rates
and purpose in making our industry uncompetitive is madness. Our
environment is damaged by the loss of truly beautiful places. Some
figures show that in 2002, 40% of our wild places remain in Scotland.
By 2009, those had reduced to 28%. Sadly, there are no up to date
figures, but for sure it has got worse. My own brief on our council
is planning and environment. I want to support this motion because wind
farms at giant con. Figures from the Department of Energy and
climate change sure that wind farms in the United Kingdom earned 1,100
million pounds for their owners. A �500 million of this was
electricity, �600 million of this was subsidy. Who pays the subsidy?
A householder. During the winter, there are times when less than 1%
of our electricity needs are generated from wind farms. But,
hang on, at the lights didn't go out, did they? Know they did not.
Because there have to be back ups     back up stations, gas or coal.
And as these power stations switched on and off, the use more
fuel and admit more carbon in exactly the same way as when you're
driving your car. So the car in is getting emitted in bigger
quantities. That is not being green. And the person who is paying for it
is the householder. Fuel poverty is rising and the Eco zealots at think
it is fine. It is not. am not and you wind farm. I think
they are all right if they are in the right place. And if people and
the planners and the Government listen to local communities. I do
not just say that because my son at belts wind farms, but I have two
main issues here. One was raised by Anne Cowan. That is that despite
what local communities say, now I represent the area that is the last
wilderness in Europe. Tourism is our main industry in the Highlands.
20% of Dot    of jobs are in hospitality. People do have serious
concerns in the Highlands and Islands about where wind farms are
and the effect on tourism and the effect on their lives. These are
not unreasonable people and they are not people who are anti  wind
farm 100%. They are reasonable people putting forward reasonable
views to their elected members and the elected members vote against
the wind farms, the communities have petitions and petitions
against the wind farms, but they know in their Hearts that when that
application get to the Scottish Government, because of the pursuit
of renewable targets, their voices will not be heard. I do not think
there is anybody here who is anti  renewable energy. I think we have
seen the role of renewable energy has to play, whether it is Hydro,
biomass, alter our technologies. I think there are many people who on
a small scale pieces would except wind onshore or offshore. But what
people are fed up with is the headlong rush into onshore wind
farm development. I am joined now from Troon by the
Scottish Conservative leader of Ruth Davidson. Congratulations on
your maiden speech to conference. I would like a bit more detail
about... Not my maiden speech! would like a little bit more detail
about this umbrella group that you're trying to forge with it the
other Unionist parties. You were setting out your stall as the
premier Unionist Party in asking others to join you. What we have
done at this conference is unveil our own campaign group called
Conservative friends to the union and asked people, anyone who wants
to help campaign, as we said yesterday we will link that in with
the umbrella group when it comes forward. I said today that the
people of Scotland are looking for all political leaders of Tunis
parties to work together and that is what I plan to do. So will we
get arable Goldie working with Alistair Darling? Is that the top
of the umbrella group? You know you're fishing for information and
I do not think I am the right person to give it you. I will be
working with John Lamond and David Mundell from my own party to make
sure that there is a concerted you that all unionists across Scotland
and the ANC political leadership in this. What is more important in
this is that it is not just about people who are members of political
parties, it is about civic Scotland as well. It is about academics, the
business community, just ordinary voters who are happy and proud to
be Scottish, may even feel more Scottish than British, but they
still feel British to and they do not want that British part of them
taken away. You work Topping in your speech and you accused    you
accused Alex Salmond of dithering. You're not paying much heed to the
Westminster consultation on this. We have seen a good response to the
Westminster consultation. I have always said that I want to see a
question put to the people of Scotland because I think delay is
damaging business. We have had a number of businesses come out and
say the very same thing. Are they are saying that this sort of delay
is damaging business. What you are actually promising and in terms of
more powers for Scotland. David Cameron said yesterday that he was
open to the transfer of more powers. Are you are open minded about that?
Because David Cameron pulled the rug from underneath your famous
line in the sand which you announced last November. What I was
saying last summer or when I was talking about the Scotland Bill was
that the most important thing was to get that bill it in and working
on the ground to see that massive transfer of powers that is coming
and I am pleased to see this week that we have an agreement between
Scotland's two governments that these powers will be transferred.
It is the biggest transfer of fiscal power in more than 300 years
and as I was saying today, let us look at using those powers. I
aspire for Scotland to be a look at    low tax economy. What more
powers could there be? You were saying yesterday that will be
announced after the referendum. It is it surprising we have no general
overall strategic approach to the United Kingdom or a full also be
about what powers there could be. think the question here is about
what Scotland wants. Does it want a separate Scottish state or does it
want to be part of a devolved United Kingdom? That is the
question. Then if there are calls from other people and to debates
within political parties, debates going on across so that Scotland,
in people's houses round the dinner people about whether they want more
powers or not, then let us look at that. As far as I see it, there is
no consensus. I am keen to see what it is that Scotland wants.
people like Alex Ferguson are supporting that all   . Looking at
the Scotland Bill, you are looking quite centre right. In other
speeches you have made... How does that go down in Scotland? I empt
the leader of a centre right party so I hardly think that is a
revelation or their headline of the day! I think I was quite clear in
the speech when I said that we need to look at what the economic
situation is in Scotland, but as a centre right party we aspire to use
the tax varying powers that be have in Scotland for to lower taxes.
were also talking about a reform of the party. As the former Tory MSP
said, if the party was a faithful old found it to be on the way to
the vet to be cut out of its misery. Do you think it is the end of the
road? Can you attract new voters? think the only people who got put
out of the Conservative Party was Brian Monteith! The opinions that
are in caring about his change in the party and I was given a mandate
to change the party. We have got people coming to our party. When I
was elected there were fewer than 9,000 members, we now have more
than 11,000 members. I hope very much that we can use the platform
at the local Government elections as the next stage in our revival in
Scotland, I do think when it comes to this issue... Our support for
the United Kingdom is in our DNA. Are you more Scottish or more
British? I am Scottish, I am British, I'm conservative and I'm
proud of all three. It does not matter to people out there in which
proportion they are, but if they want to stay part of Britain and to
know what Alex Salmond to take their Britishness away from them,
they will vote to save the Union. Thank you very much.
Just time for one final thought in the company of Professor John
Carter's. Any thoughts on that? There are a couple of things I will
take from this. One is that the Conservatives are acknowledging
that most people in Scotland are at more likely to feel Scottish than
Britain but also appreciate that people of Scotland also feel
British and the are opening    hoping to strengthen that sense of
Britishness and appealed to that for to build their case for the
union. The second thing I take from this is I am still not very clear
and I do not think the public are very clear as to where the
Conservatives stand on whether or not Scotland might have more
devolved power within the Union. We are told it seems that we are not
going to be told anything before 2014, your Ruth Davidson has
suggested that she wants to wait to see how the powers are in effect
which is not until 2016. At the same time, she also said yesterday
that she is thinking of building policy proposals that will be in
the Conservative's 2015 manifesto. That does not all add up. It is
difficult to believe that you can have a policy that you would not
announce before 2014 and you certainly cannot announce that
policy for the 2015 manifesto if you have to wait for the Scotland
Bill powers to be introduced in 2016. I think in truth the
Conservatives still need to get their act together on this issue.
Thank you very much. Our live TV coverage is now a
