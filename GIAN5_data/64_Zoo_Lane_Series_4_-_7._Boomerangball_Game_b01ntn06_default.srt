Hello! I'm Lucy.
I live at 64 Zoo Lane, and I have some very special neighbours. Look!
There's one with a hump And one who can jump
And one who is a little bit plump
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Some like it hot
And some like it chilly
And some like it both ways and that's a bit silly
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Some are friendly, some are scary
But one thing is sure   not one is ordinary
64, 64, 64 Zoo Lane
Or prickly and woolly and furry and slimy
Some are quite big
And some are very small
And the last one's Georgina
Who's incredibly tall

Bedtime, Lucy!
OK, Mum!
Whee!
Hi, Lucy.
Hi there.
Oh, what's that?
It's a football.
No, Molly, I think you're mistaken. This is a basketball.
Oh, ho, ho! No, it's a circus ball.
  Whee!
  Whoops!
No, no, no. I think you'll find what we have here is a golf ball.
Well, an elephant sized one.
Ha ha! There's so many games you can play with just one ball.
That's right, Lucy.
Oh, hello, Wally.
But I think I know a game you've never heard of.
That sounds like a story.
Yes. Let me tell you the story of the boomerangball game.
'Joey the kangaroo and his friends loved playing boomerangball,
'and their mums loved watching them play.'
Ready, Joey?
Uh huh.
Ha ha!
Great shot.
You're right there, Janet.
But just you watch, my Jimmy is getting into his stride now.
Wa hoo!
That's the way, son!
Joey never misses two shots in a row. He's such a little star.
So is my Jimmy.
Ow wow!
Aagh!
Ha ha ha! Whoops!
I don't think he was ready. There's no need to laugh, Julie  
we all know my Joey's the best player out there.
I don't know which game you've been watching,
but my Jimmy is a much better player than Joey.
  Ha!
  Ha!
Well played, Jimmy. Bonzer game.
You played great, too. Want to play again tomorrow?
Too right I do.
Mum, can we play again tomorrow, please?
I'm sorry, I don't think there'll be any more games for a while.
  But...
  No buts   home time.
'There were no more games of boomerangball all week.'
It isn't fair, Carrie  
Mum won't let me play with Jimmy and the others.
So, why don't you go there on your own?
It's too far away. And it would be no fun playing on my own.
Oh! I wish there was a way to let Jimmy know
I'm missing our games together.
No problem   I can tell him.
  Sigh!
  G'day, Jimmy.
No, it's not a good day, Carrie.
I've brought you a message from Joey.
  Really?
  Yes.
He says he wishes you could play boomerangball together again.
Oh, me too.
You two need to get your mums talking to each other again.
I have an idea.
If you take these flowers to Joey's mum,
I'll write a note pretending they're from my mum.
Good plan, Jimmy.
'It was hot and windy as Carrie flew back to Joey's home.'
Splutter!
What's this? Some scruffy old weeds and a note.
"To Janet, from your good friend, Julie."
What have you got there, Mum?
A bunch of floppy weeds from your friend's mum.
Oh, no. Jimmy sent those flowers to try
and get your mums talking to each other again.
Hmm, it didn't work. We need to try again.
This painting will make a bonzer gift for Jimmy's mum.
'Carrie flew straight back to Jimmy's home.
'She hoped this plan would work better than the last one.'
Brr!
"From your good friend, Janet."
What a horrible mess.
Hi, Mum. What have you got there?
A messy painting from your friend's mum.
Oh!
Nothing we do is working, Carrie.
I don't think our mums'll ever be friends again.
Wait up, Jimmy   I reckon I've got an idea.
Ah!
Mum, can I have a snack, please? A nice yum tum leaf sarnie?
Sure, son.
I think we can manage that.
Oh, it looks like we're out of yum tum leaves.
Would you like something else instead?
No.
OK, well, I guess I can hop out and pick some fresh.
These will do nicely.
'Jimmy's mum had just started picking yum tum leaves
'when she heard a familiar voice.'
  Yes, young Jimmy is a lovely young kangaroo.
Joey's mum, talking about my Jimmy?
'But it wasn't Joey's mum   it was Carrie pretending to be Joey's mum.'
  And he's so good at boomerangball.
It's really nice of Janet to say that. I do miss chatting to her.
Oh, that Joey is such a fussy eater  
insisting on boo roo berries for his lunch when we don't have any.
  Oh, no, the best boomerangball player by far is Joey.
'Joey's mum heard a familiar voice, too.
'It was Carrie pretending to be Jimmy's mum.'
  He and my Jimmy used to have
so much fun playing together.
They did have good times together, and I miss chatting to Julie.
Oh.
'As the day came to a close,
'Joey's mum was still thinking about what she'd overheard.'
Goodnight, sweetie.
I just need to hop out for a while, but I'll be right back.
OK, Mum.
'The next day, Joey woke up early.'
Yawn!
Morning, Mum, what are you doing?
I'm packing a picnic.
Bonzer! Where are we going?
To the boomerang ball ground.
Yeah! Ha ha!
Oh, will Jimmy be coming, too?
He sure will.
Julie and I have had a little chat
  and decided it was high time we made up.
  Fab. Wahey!
Ho ho!
Ho ho!
Your Jimmy is in great form today, Julie.
So is your Joey, Janet.
'The two mums agreed it was such a joy to see'
their youngsters play boomerangball,
they wouldn't miss it for the world.
Thanks for the story, Wally.
Oh, it was my pleasure.
I'm going to teach all my friends at school to play boomerangball.
But right now, it's time for bed.
Goodnight, everyone.
Goodnight, Lucy.
