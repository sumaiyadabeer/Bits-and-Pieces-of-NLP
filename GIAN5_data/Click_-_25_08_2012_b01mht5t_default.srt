problems.    she said. That's the summary. Now on BBC News, it's time
road towards greener transport. We will look at the new hybrid car
that is turning heads and not just because of its looks. We will also
the dough    visit the kasha run that has virtually no Mac models or
vehicles. And running your own business can be tough so we look at
how technology can help the boss stay in charge. And whether you are
the boss or just a new employee, we have an app to make filing expenses
as simple as spending the cash in the first place in Webscape.
Welcome to Click. I'm Spencer Kelly. The car industry is not shy of
technology. Bodies are designed and aerodynamic tweaks using super
technology. Even this show ring is fully digital. Over the last few
years, more technology has been applied to the problem of the
missions and dependency on fossil fuels. This man lives and works in
LA which used to be Smog Central and he has found that even though
the streets are still full of gas  guzzlers, the city has spawned a
number of hybrid roadsters and even the odd new car company.
As a red blooded American male, it is like constitutional right or
duty to drive the biggest, fastest and sexiest car on the road. But I
also live in southern California where being eco friendly is a way
of life. How do I juggle the list two? Maybe with one of these? The
Fisker Karma    Fisker Karma. It has a    has a 52 gallon drunk and
a totally unique hybrid mechanism. To understand this to the car, it
helps to understand the man. And why BMW's former top designer
believes the world is ready for his company. There is a whole new
generation of people that truly feel like, I want a different type
of vehicle to project to I am and what I believe in. And that is what
we are trying to create. It's a whole lifestyle brand. You can
drive and environmentally friendly car but it can look cool and the
fast and fun. Most new cars are first created with a visual style
in mind. That style evolves and changes as the car becomes a model.
To accommodate the mechanics. But not so with this one where design
is key. Henrik Fisker grinned up the perfect automobile and told the
engineers to make it work. The result is an American car that is
as visually stunning as any European exotic. That is because
the car is designed by a top notch car designer. Mr Fisker is an
expert. He is one of the best in the world and it shows up in the
car. Whether you like electric cars or don't, no matter what your
attitude and perspective is, when the Carmen mac goes down the street,
everybody's take turns.    the karma. But beauty is skin deep. We
petrol heads tend to find numbers. 405 horsepower. It goes to a top
speed of 125mph. And is the route to 60 in under six seconds. Not bad
for a hybrid. But forget numbers. How does he drive? In the name of
journalism, I had to verify this claims. Off I went in search of
wide open roads, promising that my insurance was up to date and that
that would take better care of the car or than the camera. Yes... When
you get in the karma, if you did not know that it was an electric
car, you probably would not know without driving, especially when
the engine is on. You get that motor noise you are used to. That
separates it from a lot of the environmentally friendly
competition, which asks drivers to sacrifice sporty feel for saving
the world, because going faster takes energy. Lots of it. That is
what all electric and hybrid cars are trying to conserve. But the
fiasco has been engineered differently from any other hybrid.
You get to choose which mode you driving. Electric, stealth mode or
sports mode, using gas. You can choose between the two using this
panel on the side of the steering wheel. Uniquely, the driver has
control over the road. It has a range Extender. In stealth mode,
the battery provides power to the wheels and is good for about 50
miles. When it is out of Jews or the driver switches to sports mode,
the four cylinder kicks in. But instead of driving the wheels
directly like every other car on the road, the petrol engine acts as
a generator, recharging the batteries and powering the rear
wheels. The benefits? Sports car  like performance. But the trade off
is that the engine only gets 20 miles per gallon. Not exactly world
class for a hybrid. If you have an engine running a generator, that
electricity is eight change of form of the energy that has to go
somewhere else and then go to the road or battery. There are losses
in the entire process and that is why the car is getting 20 miles per
gallon, as a gas car. That is a disappointing number. If the car is
far as the more efficient in all  electric mode and the fiscal wants
to be seen as a truly progressive company, it begs the question, why
not ditch the motor altogether? Even today, with the lithium ion
batteries, there is a limit to how far you can go. They have to say,
how much will people really drive every day? The average commuter is
a lot less than 50 miles. If you can put a battery in that is about
40 50 range and that you can charge overnight but then you have a range
extend or so that when you really want to go far, you can still get
to work. Despite the sporty looks and performance, it is working hard
to sell that it go from the image. With leather free interiors, a
solar panel on the roof for a bit of extra power. Even a touch screen
to let you know how all of that energy is officially being used.
But that trade off means you don't have the true leather bound luxury
we are used to seeing in other cars sporting a $100,000 price tag. It
seems this green variety does not come cheap. And that could be what
   one of the biggest obstacles. The market for a big budget hybrid
is only so big at the moment. There is already stiff competition from
well established hybrids like the Toyota clears and more recently
from Tesla, another 21st century start up which, only a few years
ago, was itself redefining the market with its super cool of all
electric road stir and which just started delivering its new model,
the cheaper form a successor. But it is not just its competitors it
is fighting. It is also fires. This one in California have happened in
early August and another one in Texas back in May that
investigators say started inside the car and spread to its owner's
home, causing $100,000 in damage. They are still investigating the
cause of this devastation but released a public statement on the
latest blaze, saying that independent investigators concluded
the cause of the fire was not the battery or engine components but
instead a faulty fan provided by an outside supplier. As a result, the
company has announced a full recall of the Carmen mac in an effort to
keep them fire free.    the calmer. Assuming they can allay fears over
the fires, the company is already looking ahead to its next model.
The Atlantic. It will benefit from lessons learned and come with a
cheaper price tag. But this car will not hit the road until at
least 2013. So, until then, it can use all of the Kama it can get.
Next, a look at this week's Tech News.
Next generation 40 mobile services are to be launched in the UK it
sooner than originally thought.    4G. Ofcom has allowed Everything
Everywhere, the company behind Corrigin and T Mobile, to change
its existing bandwidth. It is not clear when the new service which
promises faster downloads will begin. But not everybody is happy.
Many existing devices will not be compatible and operators Vodafone
and oh to have expressed their disappointment, saying their
customers will be excluded from the first wave of digital services.
Ofcom is to auction 4G to other providers next year. Nikon has
produced the first compact camera to be powered by Google's android
operating system. The Coolpix S800c is being marketed as a social
imaging device. The new operating system lets people take high 
quality pictures and upload them to social networks using certain
Alfred apps. It is seen as a Nikon's attempt to regain some of
the ground lost in recent years due to the popularity of smartphones as
cameras. Electronics brand LG has released the world's biggest UD TV,
that's all true definition. It is the largest screen to support the
advanced 4K picture format. But be warned   the 84 inch screen,
offering four HD TV is put together, will cost a whopping ï¿½14,000 to
have in your room. South Korea is the first to see them go on sale.
The rest of the world will get their next month. And the auction
site eBay is to bang the trading of fortune telling, witchcraft and
what it says his other intangible advice, including curses and
blessings. It said it was due to the high number of conflict between
buyers and sellers that became hard to resolve. It starts at the end of
August and has upset many users who started a petition. But while
thousands of people have signed up, others argue the move offers solid
consumer protection. We have looked at a new type of car
engine. Now it is time to have a quick look around a new type of car
showroom. This is Audi City   the digital show room in the heart of
London. It is completely digital and almost completely virtual, in
that there are hardly any real cars here. The idea is you can check out
the collection on these massive floor to ceiling screens.
And how do you navigate this virtual library? Not using sat nav,
you use your feet. A Xbox Kinect motion sensors catch your moves
that and tracked you as you step in and out of different venues. But if
you feel more comfortable behind a desk, you can drive the software
using these tables. Here, you customise your car and control what
is shown on the screens with a tap. The tables in the consultation
rooms downstairs also have built in sensors which recognise any
materials you place on them and register them to your customised
car. Once you fully design your car, if you don't want to buy it there
and then, perhaps you need to go home and save more money, they will
give you your car on a US beef/drive Richard Todd into your
computer at home and when you are ready you can come back and it
brings up your design there and then.    USP drive. But can you
really put up with being tantalised with this technology without riding
in the real thing? You may as well crews the selection from the couch.
But then you would need a 180 inch We are living through tough times.
A worldwide recession has forced millions from their comfortable
corporate cubicles. If you have lost your job, one solution is to
reinvent yourself as self employed. These days, there is a plethora of
gadgets and applications to help you do that. These energetic self 
starters use technology in the everyday cut and thrust of small
business. Running your own business can be a double edged sword. Yes,
you can sleep in late, but you also have to keep up with the
competition, staying on top of technology that is constantly
involving    evolving. Jacob is a freelance fight choreographer for
shows on Broadway. These moves might make it into an upcoming
version of Cyrano de gauche Iraq. Every cut and thrust must be
approved by the director miles away in London, long before the cast
comes together. That used to mean filming on a video camera, editing
on a PC and then sending a DVD discs. Now, it is being recorded on
mobile phone, giving everyone else a much easier time. Before we even
leave the rehearsal studio, I came Edit pieces together, put
commentary on it. If we are watching it, I can suggest things
that did not happen in the rehearsal. I can of load it to file
sharing websites light YouTube and get feedback immediately.
Technology has already changed many aspects of running a small business.
Managing Client bookings by e mail and text message is old hat. There
are specially created platforms for running be employed    appointment
only businesses. Heidi uses this Apple for mobile devices, which
makes it easy for customers to book appointment, especially last minute
ones. The air is less time spent on both ends and they can change it at
any time. They also get a reminder of the night before. If they have
made an appointment and they forget, they get a reminder automatically.
It is not something I have to think of. We show the new the Doxie Go
scanner a few weeks ago. In the context of a mobile workforce, this
device is causing in the revolution. It is self contained. We do not
need a computer to use it. You can also get a Wi Fi enabled s the card.
All documents and receipts can be up loaded to the cloud instantly.
Connectivity, productivity and speed. A self employed person's
dream. Invoicing can be made much easier. Now, there are many
companies offering online invoicing with the ability to capture every
service, product and expense in real time on a smartphone. Many
also offer the ability to send out reminder notices to forget for
clients at frequent interviews    intervals. Freelances are also able
to collect money electronically, a change that can make all the
difference. Out of the people surveyed, we found that people who
excepted electronic payment for their invoices were paid twice as
fast as the normal invoices going through other processes. This is
the early days of what we are dealing with electronic invoicing.
There is a lot of opportunity for interconnectedness and removing
friction. Collecting payments on the spot
with mobile devices is one of the most requested services from three
lasses. In America, it is still early days, but Jack Dorsey, one of
the founders of Twitter, has already turned his start up into a
billion dollar business because each transaction costs much less
than many other methods. A small device floods into a phone and can
be used everywhere there is a signal.
Except in mobile payments would not even have been possible a few years
ago. There are times when cash, especially large notes, can be a
problem. We realised that we needed to take credit cards. We did lots
of research of different point of sale systems. Every proposal we
received was complicated. Monthly fees and charges for equipment.
This is the beginning of a revolution in payments. Square is
pushing automatic transactions for businesses. A customer's face
appears at the checkout when he walks in with a phone. The shop
owner or business man confirms his identity visually. One, the company
has already agreed to start using it this year.    one coffee making
company. What do you do when you're small
business becomes a huge success? Personally, I always fancy buying
myself a plot of land somewhere warm, sunny and privacy.
Coincidentally, that is what Kate Russell has been doing in Webscape.
I have never taken a trip down under before, so when I heard there
were plot of land being snapped up free of charge to build what ever
you like on, how could I resist? Luckily, I did not have to fly 24
hours to get there, as this Australia is on the internet. And
all the buildings are made with Lego bricks. At the moment, and you
can only get yourself a plot of land in Australia and New Zealand,
as this project has been launched to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of the Lego brick in Australia. I felt like Captain James Cook
exploring the deserted hills and beaches. Also, I am pretty sure he
did not have a sackful of Lego bricks. It would have been nice to
see some of the special pieces like people and wheels. I hope they
expand the project to involve more elements and countries in the
future. You won't incur any travel expenses
visiting your Lego brick holiday home, but if you travel for real
and have a smartphone, Checkout this website to keep your receipts
in order. Scammed to record and enter the details. Why is it that
so many people hate filling their expenses? Turning in your travel
receipts means getting reimbursed for money you have spent. And yet,
I know so many people, including myself, who put it off for weeks
and weeks until they come to it and find they have lost all of their
receipts. That is not a problem with his application. SmartScan
works relatively well, although it has trouble identifying different
currencies. You can get 10 free SmartScan uses a mile if, after
which point in time, you have to pay. Once all of your receipts are
stored, head over to the dashboard for sorting and reporting options.
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a Facebook user
in possession of a good game will have a jolly good time playing it.
Not quite up to Jane Austen's standards, but I do believe she
would have enjoyed this latest adventure. Players must find a
Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, who have let out of the pages of the
book and run off somewhere to hide. Facebook games are generally not
that sophisticated. Some might call them boring. But they have been
designed to entertain you for a few minutes during your lunch break,
rather than drag you into an extended narrative for days at a
time. This is a good example of the genre and it has some nice touches
in the art work. With various hidden objects and games in the
seas of Jane Austen's novels, this is a charmingly literary journey
that does not tax the old grey cells too much. With a record to
get sales, the 20 top Paralympic Games start on Wednesday. But if
you do not need a ticket to keep up with all the action, life. The
official website will be streaming 780 hours a across five channels,
time results and biographies in cite the player window. There will
be daily weather log entries and, throughout the opening and closing
ceremonies, reporters will be commentating on the events as the
