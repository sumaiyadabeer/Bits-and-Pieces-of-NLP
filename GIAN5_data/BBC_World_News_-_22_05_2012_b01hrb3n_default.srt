There is a fresh warning that the crisis in the eurozone is the
biggest threat to the recovery of the world's economy. A new report
says opportunities must now be taken to tackle the problems. The
OECD findings come after the International Labour Organisation
said youth unemployment, particularly in Europe, remains at
crisis levels with no sign of improvement for at least another
four years. The split between Europe's leaders on whether to
spend or cut their way out of debt appears to be widening.
Europe is receiving a cocktail of messages from different
institutions weighing into the debate about its economy. One in
debate about its economy. One in five young people are unemployed,
warns the International Labour warns the International Labour
forecast that the economy could pick up, but also of the
consequences of getting it wrong. In the euro area, which remains the
most significant single area of risk in the global economy, had
moved away from the edge of the cliff, things had begin to
deteriorate again recently. So we cannot rule out the development of
repercussions worldwide. Further interest rate cuts were needed at
the European Central Bank. Confidence had to be restored in
banks and governments, and for that, there needed to be changes in the
way things were done. It is high time to go and structural.
Structural reforms are not only the best short term remedy left but
they also offer multiple dividends. But with the left gaining ground,
technocratic pragmatism is coming face to face with democratic
politics. Greece is the test case. One populist leader arguing for
policies that, in the eyes of many economists, simply don't make sense.
Your presence gives us strength for the fight that we
fight, because we are fighting for everyone in Europe. We are going to
win, all together. The euro crisis is a global one, with a warning now
from the International Monetary Fund of how it could impact on non 
euro Britain. The stresses in the euro area affect the UK through
many channels. Growth is too slow and unemployment, including youth
unemployment, too high. In Spain, teachers' strike over austerity
cuts, claiming long term education will be damaged. A common seen in
Europe now, as it decides whether voters or markets are best to
The OECD report, is there any glimmer of good news? There is, on
one hand. To summarise what the OECD said, it is important. It is a
very influential think tank. It says it seems to be the one thing
which could throw the whole global economy of truck    off track. The
OECD points out in its report that there is the recovery going on,
there is a small recovery. It is pointing towards recovery picking
up in China and Brazil. In Japan there were figures for the Japanese
GDP which were very encouraging. But the eurozone could throw all of
that out of the window. Those in France might say, look, what is
happening there. They might even say that the euro cannot afford to
do that kind of thing because they are at the whim of the markets. The
argument seems to be heading more towards the idea of growth rather
than austerity, and this is the great attention that is being set
up. Youth unemployment, one of the symptoms of the problems facing the
eurozone. The UN agency in charge of workers' rights has said that
the number of young people aged 15 to 24 without jobs now stands at
almost 75 million worldwide. This is a figure that has risen by 4
million since 2007. Some of the highest rates of unemployment are
in the EU. That is where one in five under 24s are looking for jobs.
In some figures    some countries the figure is far higher. They risk
becoming increasingly detached from society altogether, and becoming
long term unemployable. relatively large share of young
people are detached from the labour market. At the risk of dropping out
of education systems, and it is very important that there are young
people, especially at the bottom of the Labour Market, who have an
opportunity to train, educate, or find a proper job. Onto some
corporate news from Australia. Qantas has been on the rise after
the airline announced radical restructurings plans, effectively
splitting the company in two. This is one of the biggest changes
to the structure of Qantas since it was formed in 1920. The business
being split in two, separating domestic flights from international
ones. The new ventures will each have their own chief executive,
able to establish different plans for growth. Qantas has seen half
yearly profits fall by 80%, the result of high fuel costs, a strong
Australian dollar and weak passenger demand. The current boss,
Alan Joyce, will stay on to oversee both new ventures. He is regarded
as a tough but effective leader, who can return the company to
profitability. But will it all work? Well splitting Qantas in two
be enough to revive this proud national carrier. No one really
knows until it has been given the chance to work over the next few
months. A critical time for an airline with a long and impressive
history. The move to divide the company comes a day after Alan
Joyce announced around 500 job losses at the Quantas maintenance
operation, reducing the number of plants from 3 two. The measure
challenged by the unions, but seen by Qantas as one more key step to
reducing costs. Now to Japan. Bearing in mind what
I was saying about Japanese growth, there has been a downgrade from
Japan from Fitch credit agency. It has cut Japan's sovereign debt to
AA, from double A. The country struggles through much needed tax
hikes, trying to rein in national debt. Its national debt amounts to
more than twice gross national product, although most of that debt
is held domestically. Another casualty of the eurozone
crisis, profits on Vodafone. The telecoms giant has been forced to
write down the value of its assets by over $6 billion in Italy, Spain,
Portugal and 1C. Pre  tax profits to 31st March were $15 billion, but
the world's largest operator was forced to cut its operating profits
Apple is getting stronger, according to a survey of brand
values. Samsung appears to be gaining ground, as do brands from
rising markets, reflecting the spending power of the so called
BRIC economies. Let's have a quick look at the markets. The European
markets, all of them are up. Talk about increased stimulus policy
being put into place by China, some comments at the weekend from the
Chinese authorities. And also, the meeting later on this week amongst
the eurozone countries, again hoping for some kind of stimulation
of the economy. We hope. We all want growth. Thank you very
much. Let's catch up with some of the
rest of the day's news. Sri Lanka's former army chief, President Obama,
The UN said the military killed tens of thousands at the time and
Sarath Fonseka told the BBC's reporter how he felt to be released.
If I produce behind bars, later on I put you out, what do you feel
about it? What about the terms of your release? We be able to re 
enter politics or you forbidden from doing that? I have completed
the prison sentence already. Unless they reverse it, I can't do
politics. As it is, we don't know exactly what the agreement is, but
we will know. Would you like to re  enter the political arena and to
challenge Mahinda Rajapaksa for the presidency again? Yes. It is not
but I want to become the President of the country or something. My
intention is not to contest fought the presidency and become the
President of the country. I have a political agenda to change the
cultural agenda in this country. March, the United States sponsored
a resolution at the un Human Rights Council, critical on human rights
performance in tracker, saying it's to do more on reconciliation and
accountability for alleged war crimes    performance in Sri Lankan.
That was passed. Did you welcome that? Straight away, we agree.
Violations of human rights and the reconciliation, yes, it is a must.
The war crimes, there are various different opinions. We have to
argue with that, argue it out, clarify any doubts, so that those
who are pointing out special issues, I believe they must point out
specific issues. The way some people hide their face, they give
the impressions to the rest of the world that these people are guilty
already. I am ready to answer any allegations about war crimes in
relation to the military operations. That is my position.

summit in Chicago, promising full support to Afghanistan whilst also
saying they will withdraw troops by 2014. But that deadline may not be
the end of Western involvement. Barack Obama says his strategic
partnership with President Karzai means a long term relationship with
Afghanistan is likely. Caroline Wyatt is in Chicago.
NATO, not unexpectedly, his deeming the summit a success. An agreement
has been reached with the money nations that contributes to the
ISAF in Afghanistan for what happens next. The communique at the
end of the summit has said that the Afghan forces will be in the lead
on security by the middle of 2013. That should allow time for them to
bed in, but also for NATO forces to still be there if there are
problems for the Afghan national forces. On the side of NATO, it
hasn't managed to reach a deal with Pakistan on the issue of reopening
supply routes to the south, which are very important for NATO, not
least as they withdraw something like 122,000 shipping containers
worth of equipment that they have, 70,000 armoured vehicles, many of
which will need to go home after the combat is over. That is pretty
key. President Zardari has gone back to Pakistan saying he will
talk to officials to instruct them that this deal must be made. That
is something that will be a continuation from the summit,
pretty key for me to itself. The other world leaders go home after a
very long period    pretty key for NATO itself. The other world
leaders are probably satisfied that the cracks have not appeared too
wide. Where it leaves Afghanistan, that remains to be seen. David
Cameron said Afghanistan should not be abandoned by its NATO and the
Taliban had been defeated on the battlefield. The Taliban and people
of Afghanistan may see that different league. They have had a
lot of assurances about what happens next but I think the proof
of whether the Afghan national security forces can cope in the way
that NATO's says they can will be seen in the coming months in

recession. Sri Lanka's former army chief
Sarath Fonseka tells the BBC that his country must co operate with
any war crimes investigation. Egyptians are getting ready to
elect a President, the first leadership vote since the toppling
of former President Hosni Mubarak last year. His 30 year rule was
brought to an end by a wave of protests focussed on Tahrir Square
in Cairo. But as John Leyne reports, Egypt's next leader is likely to be
decided by voters outside the Politics always takes second place
to the price of cattle out here on market day. But these Egyptian
villages are clearly enjoying the opportunity to choose their
President. After years in which they have been taken for granted.
In the past, if they said Hosni Mubarak, it was Hosni
Mubarak. Now we have 13 to choose from.
As we talk, the crowd pushes him. Who is going to vote? Lots of hands.
Lots of different choices. To understand the selection better we
travelled even deeper into the countryside. This is where it could
well be decided. Most Egyptians still live out here, not in the big
cities. On the face of it, not much has changed in Egypt since the
revolution but look more deeply and you will find people thinking for
themselves, speaking their own mind for the first time. That's what
makes this whole election so unpredictable. Someone always used
to tell these people how to vote. The ruling party, the head of the
family. Now the candidates have to fight for their support. Egyptians
like Gamal who is a vote is keenly sought. Women in the villagers now
make up the highest proportion of undecided voters. It's a huge
political and social change. I just want everything
to be stable. I want the problems here to be over so life can be
better. Have you decide who to vote for? Tellingly, she looks at her
husband. Not completely independent yet. Her husband Mohammed says,
since the revolution, crime has increased, prices are going up.
God willing, things will change after the election and
a good person will take us out of this crisis to safety, because our
lives are getting harder. This very conservative country is in the
throes of dramatic change. No wonder the voters are having
trouble making up their minds. After all, it is the first free
vote for almost 5,000 years. The BBC's Lyse Doucet is in Cairo
for us now. How interest there are people in the prospect of this
historic vote? Who is the front  runner? I have to say that reading
the opinion polls we had the observation that there's lots of
undecided voters in these elections. Some say it could be as many as 30%.
When we have travelled across different neighbourhoods of Cairo,
it was interesting to see how many Egyptians had a very strong views
about who they wanted to see for their President. Everywhere we went
there was no clear front runner. That's one of the most important
things about this election. It's truly open. Just judging by the
kind of debate we have been seen on the streets by the election posters,
and the real excitement about when the first presidential debates were
held here, on television, the first ever in the Arab world. This is
being seen as a crucial moment in this country sister    history.
What about the controversial role of the military? This is a really
big question. First of all, let's point out that this election for
president is taking place before the powers of the President had
been spelt out in a new constitution and one of the key
aspect will be what will the powers of the military be? After six
decades of virtually unchallenged military dominance, in this country,
in the economy, society, will there be a President who tries to curtail
the powers, helped by a new constitution? Will be defence
budget be scrutinised? Some say the military should go on trial for
what they regard as some of the crimes committed by the military.
It's a huge issue in this election. It's a huge issue in Egypt today.
No one can say with certainty how it will unfold. Thanks very much.
Would you be prepared to take part in a medical trial? A recent survey
in the UK found that nearly three quarters of people would. The BBC
has found out that some research companies have seen a huge rise in
the number of applicants. Jenny Hill's been given exclusive access
to two medical trials. No one knows how they might react.
You're looking at a phase one clinical trial. The pharmaceutical
company won't tell us what kind of drug these people have taken. But
we do know it's being checked for potential side effects to the heart.

to fund a family holiday. My mum was the most worried, I think
because she was not just worried for me, for the drug testing and
the side effects, but also the actual effect on my children and
how it would psychologically affect them so, yeah, it was quite tough.
Claudiu's a medical student about to start his seventh trial. He,
like all volunteers, has to leave a three month gap between each trial.
It's really important because humanity has to advance. It doesn't
need to stay where it is. It needs to improve, to put on the market

A magnitude 5.6 earthquake has struck Bulgaria near the capital,

pollution around the world is vast and it can cause untold damage to
the environment. Now scientists have come up with an unusual
solution to the problem and it comes in the shape of a robotic

easily through the water. If you want to do pollution readings, you
they can run autonomously and do it for you. But further than that, if

The next challenge for the team is to cut those costs so they could
