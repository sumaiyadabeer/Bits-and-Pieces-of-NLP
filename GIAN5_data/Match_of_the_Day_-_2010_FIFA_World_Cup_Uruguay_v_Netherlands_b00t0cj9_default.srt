Hello. The match to date is the Netherlands taking on Uruguay for a
place in the World Cup final. In Cape Town are Mark Bright and
as they did when a Dutch explorer found it that town. Will Dutch
nerve hold where it faltered at this stage in 1998, 20021004? As
for Uruguay, the African continent does not seem ready to forgive the
way they knocked out Karnak in the quarter final. Suarez is suspended
after his hand ball. Godin returns from injury. Gargano gets his first
2010 World Cup semi finals. In the warm up they looked determined. I
have to say that the Dutch look will settle a few nerves. A typical
nervous. I think they do not want to underestimate Uruguay. I think
it is focused. I think they are up the short of themselves but one
thing you cannot do is so far had been the central
midfield players screaming the centre backs.    protecting the
from this Pakistan, he took the Germany quarter final. Many people
thought he was in line for the final. Our own Howard Webb might

energy, at the goalkeeper    Muslera. He was the fourth
goalkeeper that they used in 2 0 defeat against Holland in
drop back in,    Diego fallen, but it looks like Cavani will be taking
international football after this goal in the last six World Cup
semi finals. The last person to injured in the quarter final and
today is only available for the bench. In training they said he can
only run in straight lines, and defenders cannot only ran in
straight lines. You try your very best to get out for a semi final
but if you are a detriment to the dropped deep and allow Holland to
have the ball in their own half    finals that they have played in.
Suarez has a bandage on that finger! I wonder how he injured
many holidays in Ghana. They have not been very for giving.    for

18 minutes, an absolute stunner. Playing in his third World Cup
finals, he retires after this competition. And has he put Holland
on the way to the final? What a marvellous strike. It gets no
better than this. The World Cup semi final, he strides into the
picture here. You're thinking, what is he going to do? It is a
fantastic effort. When you talk about the top corner, it is right
in there. What a strike. I was wondering, van Persie has not
really been in the game, Kuyt, Robben, they have not got past
anybody. You need something a little special to get the game
going and it does not get any better than that. In a royal wave
to Giovanni van Bronckhorst. It is his first goal for his country
since Italy 2008. These are his six for major finals. 14 years he has

Forlan. This is the 10th semi final between Europe and South America.
Only twice have Europe come out on strike by Diego Forlan. In 1974,
his father was in the Uruguay team beaten in the finals by Holland.
And Forlan is looking for retribution. Stekelenburg, the
goalkeeper, has had nothing to do in this game. Forlan finds a bit of
space. This is a good turn. He comes inside and opens up. It looks
like it is straight at Stekelenburg. It is a bad goalkeeping error!
Straight at him! It is not the first time in this competition that
we have seen a shot from a range by Diego Forlan wobbled horribly in
the air for the goalkeeper. Since Holland scored, Uruguay have looked
the better team. They are trying to get forward. With Holland, there is
so many passes, but I think they need to move the ball forward
That was virtually straight at the goalkeeper. He should be pushing it
this is a similar distance to the decent strike. It was on the target
and Stekelenburg to get in the midriff.    took it. The game has
denoted that it was. No action taken by the referee. Victorino...
He was boarding the man who dived. Pereira, moving forward well. The

Great delivery from Sneijder. Count coming in off the touchline.

nowhere near offside. Great delivery. He could have done what
better. Excellent ball from Scheiber. Not enough of that from

we would see a change of pace from Holland but we have not. Full marks
to Uruguay for defending really well. They defend from the front.
They chase the ball and it puts pressure on the boys at the back. I
thought van der Vaart might have been a better choice to keep the
past him. But Eljero Elia goes past people. I wonder whether he is
thinking it might open the game up a little bit to get someone who can

Stekelenburg does well here. He was not sure whether it was on target

looked to make sure that it crept in. Schneider will be credited with
his 5th goal of the tournament. He is level in that shoot out for the
boot, was van Persie offside? was the furthest part of his body.
He has to have been, because he's one aphid. He was active. Surely,
he was in a line of the goalkeeper's eyesight?    the line.
Credit to Sneijder. His 4th goal, it is saying, on the screen, but he
was never credited with the earlier own goal. He was given that one as
goal! A header from Arjen Robben. He pats his head, because they do
not come along too often, headed goals from Arjen Robben. Has the
Dutch master put Holland in the World Cup final? Two goals in three
minutes for Holland. Is that the goal by Arjen Robben that puts them
with one foot in the final? It was a good move. A really good move for.
He worked it all way across. Once again, a right footed player
playing on the opposite side. Robben is on the move, he gets in
front of the defender. That is an excellent header. Pushed right back
across the goal. There is no where that their goalkeeper can go to get
to that. All the sudden, Uruguay abroad at a major football
tournament when Hollander prying, I guarantee you, you will enjoy
yourselves.    Holland are playing. at the costumes and the colour and

they have a decent chance. Bringing on new players, but this is the
goal. It is a good header. It was a Arjen Robben. He ended the season
with 13 goals in 15 games to win the Double with Bayern Munich.
There in the Champions League final as well. Wesley Sneijder is still
on course for a remarkable and unique quadruple. League and cup,
with Inter Milan and Champions League. Cowed goes to ground.   
Balls are the sort of situations that Arjen Robben loves. His team
is in the ascendancy and the has a swing. He tried to poke it.
Good defending. Victorino getting players up front. That is why the

the better team, the more adventurous team has won the game,
surely. Uruguay after about 60 Minutes looked to be passing it,
but Dutch class has told in the end. Or has it? We have three minutes of
it? Is there still another twist in what has been a marvellous semi 
final? They switched off. They could short corner. It comes
through a couple of players but it is quite close to the goalkeeper
again. He dives later and it goes under his arm. If that had come a
few minutes earlier. One minute of stoppage time to go. Surely the
Dutch are not going to throw it free kick to Holland. And there is
a yellow card for van Bommel for dissent. But Holland have a free
kick and I think van Bommel was screaming to the referee to blow
his whistle. I think he is asking the referee how long to go. I do
not think he complained about the free kick. And he has been booked
