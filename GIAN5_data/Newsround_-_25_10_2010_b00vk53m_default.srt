Hi, guys. Welcome back. Good to be back. It is Ore and Ricky for the
half term holiday week on Newsround. If your half term has been and gone,
sorry, you've had your school, get    fun, get over it.
Coming up: The tourist attractions celebrating the Chilean miners
water. Before that, we are talking about
child workers. We are not talking about a paper round or odd jobs,
these are children forced into long, exhausting hours of hard work,
often in dangerous or unsuitable places for kids. Usually it is a
problem far from home. But seven children have been rescued in
England after these pictures showed them working on a freezing farm in
terrible conditions for hours on end, without any warm clothes. It
shocked people that children as young as nine were involved.
Starting at 730 am and only finishing when it gets dark.
Working for hours on end in the freezing feel his heart, tiring
work. It's tough enough for adults. But the youngest of these kids were
nine. When they were found, they didn't seem to have any food or
clothes thick enough to keep them warm. It was very cold and windy.
It was exceptionally muddy and wet. The children were sitting... Some
of them were sitting on the ground. The seven children were all from
Romania in Europe. Some were with parents, others were not. The
people that took them into care are worried that they could have been
taken from their families and brought to this country especially
to work. That is called trafficking. It's against the law and it's a
growing problem here. What is the law when it comes to kids working
in this country? Older children are allowed to work. There are laws in
place to protect kids so that they are not forced to waken the country.
You are allowed to work over the age of 14, but only for a few hours
and not so it makes any difference to your education. There are many
countries, including places like India, where people have to work
for long hours, in bad conditions, to keep food on the table for their
families. That's the kind of thing that laws need to be in place to
stop happening. Before the start of the last century, lots of children
in Britain were made to work. They worked in factories, down the mine
and even add to climb up chimneys to clean them. That all stopped
when new laws were brought in. Even now, over 150 million kids are
forced to work around the world. Police in the UK want to make sure
it isn't allowed to happen here. We have now heard from the local
council that the six children taken into care have been reunited with
their parents. A full investigation has been launched.
More hopeful news from Haiti, where the spread of the deadly disease
collarette seems to be slowing down. Thousands of people are still
living in terrible conditions after the earthquake in January. The
dirty water and bad food has been helping to spread the disease.
Aid workers are now handing out soap, bottled water and telling
people to wash their hands, which seems to be helping.
Now, a piece of rock or a photo next to a rusty old pipe don't
sound that appealing, unless they were part of the greatest rescue
ever. That's right, bits and pieces from the Chilean miners amazing
story are being spread across the globe. It's bringing out fans of
the guys in their hundreds, from Chile all the way to China. Any
excuse to Cedars rescue pictures again.
It has been only two weeks since the 33 Chilean miners were rescued
from the deep in front of millions. Now everyone wants a piece of
history. As they get used to their many public appearances, on the
other side of the world people in China are queuing around the block
to have their photo taken with one of the capsules built to rescue
them. It wasn't actually used in the rescue, but that doesn't seem
to matter. They just want a bit of this incredible global story. Back
in Santiago, the actual rest YouTube used to bring the men up
one by one is on display in the main square.    rescue tube. People
have already been given pieces of rock. And to protect the note being
printed on everything from T shirts to mugs, it has become the property
of the minor that wrote it. You will have to ask his permission
before it can be plastered across any of the millions of souvenirs
which are sure to follow. We are talking about these things.
Could you tell your friends apart from just there ears?
fundamental difference is that mine are really small. A scientist say
that the most recognisable parts of our bodies are these things and
are ever the same. Technology keeps a close eye on us.
On CCTV cameras following us on the street to X ray machines that the
airport. Our fingerprints and even aware eyes can reveal whom we are.
But now there is a new way of telling us apart. Our ears!
Researchers have risk    discovered that these things are one of the
most recognisable part of our body and they could soon be used to
identify us. It is all going on inside his brightly cover it
collared off    brightly coloured corridor at the University of
Southampton. It measures hour every move. Cambois take a snapshot of
our ears, which is uploaded to a computer. That is where the magic
happens. These tiny lines work out the shape of the ears and produce
data that is unique to each and every one of us. From the data we
have, it seems that everybody has a different shape and structure. When
you are born, it is pretty fully developed. It just grows bigger as
you grow older. It doesn't change. We have come a long way in the last
20 years. Fingerprints and body scanners. Who knows, in the next 20
do two things that stick out from the side of your head might be just
as important as your passport. Remember, you've heard it here
dolphins have been spotted off the coast Australia using their tails
to walk on water. Experts think that they copied their moves from
an adult dolphin who had spent time at a theme park. If you ask me,
they are just showing off. Last up, this is the moment and
They could only watch as it dropped into the Pacific Ocean. The place
where the house was built is called Washaway Beach!
