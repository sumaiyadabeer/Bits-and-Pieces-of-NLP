The '80s, where do you bloody well start?
Well, that's an irritating and overused phrase in itself, but, really.
Looking back on it, I don't honestly know how we even managed to live through them, seriously.
The '80s was the decade which began with some American lunatic shooting John Lennon
and ended up with some British lunatic dreaming up the Poll Tax.
And leaving aside the day to day stuff like
how on Earth did we survive the mullet hair cut?
How did we survive the Rubik's cube?
  How for the love of God did we survive Spit The Dog?
  Oh, please!
And Rod Hull and stupid blinking Emu.
Oh, that's nice.
How? How? How?
Oh, the decade of mullets.
I wish I could fly...
People got really smug and really pleased with themselves really quickly about not very much.
There was very little in the '80s that I ever want to see in my wardrobe ever again.
Dancing with a mullet to Duran Duran in a shiny suit.
No one really understood the shoulder pads. They're coming back.
Big belts, big beads, big hair, big egos,
big wallets.
The music was so crap.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, and that became the '80s noise.
I don't think we'll ever have a decade that we'll look upon now with such...
Disgust.
The '80s brought us more reasons to be
grumpy than any decade since the 1660s brought us the Black Death.
In fact, little irritations like the Black Death pale into insignificance
  How could we even live in the same country as someone who thinks this stuff is funny?
  How are you?
How do you do, sweetheart? How are you, sir?
Good to see you. How are you?
Wait, wait, wait.
I can do it. Three, two, one.
Three, two, one to stop it being rude.
You had to go three, two, one. That's what he did.
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to your big Saturday show, three, two, one.
Can you do that yet?
  There you are.
  Three, two, one.
You know what's really sad about that is I've clearly practiced it, haven't I?
I think it was the only quiz show with a catch hand signal.
I've seen him in interviews since talking about
that movement, that, well, you know it was discussed and the trick is...
Wow, you're explaining that to me, that's incredible!
Come along, Dusty.
Yeah.
It was completely baffling.
A lot of it seemed to hinge around a character that was made out of a bin.
You know, so, I know what will brighten up Saturday night television, a dustbin!
And the clues were just impossible.
I just keep expecting Ted Rogers to break into binary codes at one stage
and go, the next clue is 11101111110111. What do you think the price might be?
I am the great fiasco, which is close to what you could win.
There were Sherlock Holmes mysteries that were simple
to solve compared to this.
A motor powered bunny?
Not quite, but is it a bin?
Stephen Hawking would have struggled to decipher what they were on about.
A bird flies west, what about the A in Russia? What?
You'll think the rhyme may not be fair with a minimum of thought.
It's made out of metal, it's dusty and grey, if you've got one of these you'll throw things away.
He goes, "Oh, I'll reject that Ted."
Definitely keep the egg? And you're going to reject the parasol, yes?
Let's see what you've rejected. If you've got one of these...
These, that rhymes with palm trees and away, that rhymes with holiday,
you've rejected the 321 holiday in the Bahamas.
That's how tenuous it used to be.
That's the way it goes sometimes. See you next week!
321, goodnight everybody. Bye.
Suspend your powers of incredulity for a moment and take a look at this.
This is what we thought was trendy in the '80s.
I know(!)
Does anyone know where they used to get these nerds from?
Seriously, this must be what Mrs Thatcher called Care In The Community.
Oi! We said we wanted you to look as though you were having a good time,
not showing symptoms of chilli powder up the sphincter.
Ah, but then again, if you're dancing to bands as repellent as Buck's Fizz who can blame them?
A tribute to how far you can go by ripping a girl's skirt off.
It really is incredible, isn't it, someone pulling someone's skirt off
to reveal a slightly shorter skirt beneath.
And then they went, "Whoo," and pulled away the skirt. Da dah!
And that was the act, that was the finale.
But if you want to see some more...
The shame and the embarrassment.
That's when I started to say I was half Spanish really loudly all the time. I was really mortified.
I think what is different about the terrible music of the '80s
is that we...
We go back to it now with affection and that, I think, is...
Should be illegal.
Uh uh uh... There's a dec...
There's a noise for every decade of the music.
In the '50s it's kind of a "huh," that noise, but Dexy, whatever his
name was, Kevin Rowland, he was the noise of the '80s.
Uh, uh, uh!
It seemed to me to be the triumph of the mathematician over the musician.
Somebody learned to plug something in and press, boop,
and you got some shit beat and some tuneless git sang over the top
and suddenly it was supposed to be really groovy.
It was like, no, that's crap.
It's all a bit crap, isn't it?
I think we all knew it was a bit shallow and a bit crap at the time, but no one would admit it.
My first musical hero
was Shakin' Stevens.
Behind the green door...
I know, I know...
And, you know... I...
I can't believe I've just admitted that again on television!
Door slam...
Adam And The Ants, what the... What was going on with Adam And The Ants?
One bad drummer playing too much wasn't enough, they had to get two bad drummers playing all the time?
Kajagoogoo. Catch a googoo. Catch a shit band.
Hey, girl, move a little closer.
Now, that shouldn't have been allowed.
I thought The Human League were crap.
I thought they were rubbish then and I think they... Don't you want...
Don't you want me, baby?
Not really. Don't want you at all, actually. Shut the hell up!
"I was working as a waitress at a cocktail bar."
There's something quite funny about that,
tongue in cheek at least, whereas you never got...
You never got the feeling that Duran Duran had a tongue or a cheek.
Why don't you use it?
I mean, it was just brass neck.
I hated, hated the banality and mediocrity
of Swing Out Sister's Break Out.
Break out.
Just that whole, "Break out!"
It doesn't mean anything... What are you talking about?
You're just a sort of very vague notion of striving for something very nebulous.
You've got to find a way, say what you want to say...
Break out...
Break out of what? What are you... What are you talking about?
Spandau Ballet were kind of big on that...
And if you look at them now at the footage of them then, it just looks absolutely stupid.
At least with Spandau...
At least they had the decency to break up.
Duran Duran staggered on like a wounded...
Like a buffalo with 50 arrows in it.
Staggered on making a horrible bellowing noise for 25 years.
This is a song to all of my friends...
Howard Jones, you know, he used to come on with like banks of these
synthetic synthesisers and a bloke who used to dance next to him.
Jed I think his name was, he used to be a mime artist with a bald head
who used to do things with chains and... Oh, no.
Throw off your mental chains, ooh, ooh, ooh...
As Howard Jones sang about throwing off your mental chains,
and then in case we were finding that concept too hard to grasp he put someone on stage with him.
Throw off your mental chains Ooh, ooh, ooh!
That wasn't great, was it? I think Howard's probably a bit embarrassed about that now.
You know what it's like when you're doing something tragic and you say,
never mind, one day we'll all look back on this and laugh?
Well, not enough time has passed to be able to look back at all this and laugh.
With most of this stuff all you can do is look back and be completely and utterly mortified.
I mean, Agadoo was genius in that it was, one and the same time,
the most ridiculously useless attempt at music
that someone could make, and yet you can't possibly forget it.
I mean, you know, in that sense it's evil, it is the true essence of evil, isn't it, something like that.
Aga do do do...
Push pineapple up a tree? Is that what it was?
Aga do do do push pineapple, grind coffee.
Stuff a goose, wring its neck, smear the entrails up the wall.
is that not right?
It was absolute bollocks.
It was tasteless shite and I'm really proud to say I hated it then.
No, I... Just it's irritated me even talking about it.
Don't embarrassing things happen in your life,
in your country and that... That...
That's what we've got to look back on? That and Margaret Thatcher.
Yes, we were going to have to get around to her in the end.
The '80s brought us Margaret Roberts Thatcher.
In a moment of collective madness we elected her in 1979 and then watched over a decade as she went gradually
and publicly mad, culminating at the end of the decade with the Poll Tax riots.
And then, wait for it, this...!
We have become a grandmother.
That's when you realised, "Oh, my God, you've gone proper potty,"
because it was either, like... You know, you think you're the Queen...
The wave of hatred was really quite incredible,
without being accused of being a misogynist.
The fact that she's just said a mad thing doesn't make any...
She was mad to start with!
All these people, "Do you think she's going off the boil?"
Argh! It was unimaginable compared to now.
This is someone who called Nelson Mandela a terrorist and she was the Prime Minister!
That was the time when if two men in white coats have sidled up and led
her gently away we would all have breathed a sigh of relief, but as
well as bringing us a dual monarchy, the era of Mrs Thatcher also brought Ronald Reagan
whom we all thought was a genial, but essentially simple old sold.
Yes, my friends, God gave us poor people for only two reasons,
one to work all week for practically nothing, two, to give us something to laugh at on Sundays.
On Spitting Image Ronald Reagan was not as funny as the real thing.
It just seemed impossible that this had happened.
The fact that we hired an actor, who was a bad actor,
to be a bad politician and if you look back on it now...
And people bought his shit hook, line and sinker.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
I mean, we had Ronald Reagan, a second rate actor, and then we had the Wicked Witch of the West.
It was like a panto. It was extraordinary times.
Everyone got very angry,
everyone went on demonstrations and it doesn't happen now.
Everybody had something to say in the '80s.
Poll Tax riots, everybody was out, everybody did something about it and, actually I...
I kind of miss that.
At least in the '80s people shouted about it
and had riots, proper riots.
That's before the police got proper protection!
It was an era of greed is good and slick haired arses calling themselves
the Masters Of The Universe, snotty nosed City whiz kids earning
vast fortunes and sticking cocaine up their noses day and night, though not only these people, obviously.
It took a while, but at least they got theirs in the end.
Yuppies were just people who'd made loads of cash and were really excited about it.
And then all the richer people would get huge expensive deliberately ridiculously
ostentatious bottles of Champagne in front of the cameras and go,
"Look at us, we're rich, you're not, ha ha ha!"
I used to know people in advertising they used to drink Krug on a daily basis.
You know, insane amounts of money people were making in the '80s.
They sort of embodied everything that was evil about this greedy,
grabbing, me, me, me, decade that we were forced to live through.
You know, it really was backstabbing era,
so at the time, of course, I wasn't that aware of it
because I was probably doing a bit of it myself.
How awful! What an arse I must have been in those days.
Anyway, got through it all right.
I used to string them up, Yuppies.
I had a little concern.
We used to smoke 'em.
String them up and smoke 'em.
There was one moment where I did find myself face to face with the true
spirit of the '80s when I was asked to do a comedy turn at some
sort of corporate party and I turned up there and there was just sort of
deliberate waste, people were deliberately just getting piles of food and throwing it away.
It was just sort of, "Ha, look at us, we're so... So...
"We're so ostentatious, look, we can only consume that amount of drink,
"so we're going to get twice that much and just tip it over each other!"
I was doing a joke, unwisely doing a joke about money because now I know there's nothing funny about money,
but anyway doing this joke, mentioned an overdraft, heckled with, what's an overdrafts?
Haw haw haw haw!
And everyone around haw haw haw.
And I thought, "I've nothing to say to you."
Lucky for me I grew up in a neighbourhood that was right next to
the West Village which was where a lot of all that stuff...
All the yuppies played and for us it was easy
pickings because we used to like rob dudes, so like for us it was great.
You know, we had Rolexes.
Yeah, the guy over there with the sweater tied around his shoulders, he's probably got a Rolex on.
Thonk, you get yourself a Rolex.
They must look back on their lives and think, you know,
"I was such a twat, but then, don't we all?"
The '80s was the era of the acronym, which means we couldn't quite bring ourselves to call people
what they were, total prats and airheads, so the newspapers made up cute little words and
children used to enjoy explaining to bewildered parents what they meant.
I know this is hard to believe now, but that's really what happened, honest.
British people are so angry the whole time on the inside,
and compartmentalising and carving each other up into little tick boxes.
"Oh, look, you're a strappy or a slappy, a strip pined Laura Ashley person."
Dinkies   Double Income No Kids.
Sinkies   Single Income No Kids.
Yuppies, Young Urban Wankers... They got that wrong.
Young Upwardly Mobile Mothers, yummies.
Is that what it was called? Yummies.
I mean, you know, yuppies meant Young Upwardly Mobile whatever whatever.
I used to just I think they're a bunch of twats.
Yeah, Single Income with No Kids, is that what it was?
Sinky?
And whether you were a yuppie, a dinky, a sinky or a slappy,
or just a little bit wanky you were absolutely no one unless you had one of these.
Your Filofax told us more about you than anything else, remember?
It was a diary resembling a brick which doubled as a step for reaching high shelves.
It was like an acoustic BlackBerry, the ultimate badge of success for the go faster generation.
The Filofax. Isn't it funny, everybody had one?
And the bigger it was the more important you were,
particularly if you had things falling out of it.
Oh, yes, those are all my really important numbers.
So I never actually had a Filofax, and they were really expensive!
They were like 80 quid or something, weren't they? They cost a fortune.
And the fatter your Filofax clearly the more important and successful you were.
I always remember all those smug types who had...
Used to have this bulging Filofax, this bulging...
And they couldn't even...
And the leather was so well worn and used because they were always opening
it to look up and attend their busy, busy exciting, brilliant lives.
It was cool to have something that went round your wrist that contained your Filofax.
No, that was all wrong, wasn't it, really, you know?
A nice shiny leather thing for men to clutch and pretend that they're organised. It wasn't very pleasant.
And it was, like, oh, I've got so many addresses because I'm so popular
and I've got so many social events and, oh, there's so much happening
at work and I've got so many job offers and I've got so many trips to organise.
Because you had everything in your Filofax.
You had an insert for your credit cards and ID and stuff like that,
so you could in theory own someone's entire existence if you got your hands on their Filofax.
And they'd flaunt their busy, popular wonderful lives and going, oh, I've got to... Where do I start?
There's so much going on in my life.
Whereas me, it was always rather sad.
If I'd a Filofax, I probably would have just had the inserts that it came with.
So now is the moment for viewers of a sensitive disposition to look away,
and if you stay with us be warned, we're about to show you something even sadder than the Filofax.
It's sadder than homelessness, sadder than the death of Bambi's mother.
Yes, that's right, it's a home made Filofax.
The secret behind these homemade ones is that they've been made mostly from
bits and pieces that you can find lying around at home.
But if you look at this attractive one with the paperclips
on top you can see that here I've cut a piece of graph paper from an old maths schoolbook.
The big problem with being very, very rich is that for the most part you can only eat one dinner a day
lest you end up looking like John McCririck, unless some very clever person
can find a way to have you part with loads of money, but still have you leaving the restaurant hungry.
People started to get quite interested in food and you got this thing, nouvelle cuisine,
which was a brilliant plan dreamt up by somebody to give people not much for their money.
Instead of having a meal that filled you up, that you would
have something that you pretended had filled you up and it was like the Emperor's new clothes.
And the idea of paying more for less was a badge of honour, you know?
"I went to the restaurant today and I ate about 10 calories and it cost me two grand!"
For most people it was just this absurdity that they couldn't get their heads round,
that someone was paying £35 for a drizzle of noisette of nutmeg
resting on a speck of dust.
If you walked into a restaurant and they gave you two pieces of guinea fowl the size of 50 pences,
you know, on a plate, like, this wide, you know,
which was more or less a tray, and a little dribble of sauce and all that kind of thing.
And you didn't as soon as the waiter had put it down summon him back
and say, "Whoa, hang on a minute, where's the rest of it?"
Leaf, leaf of sycamore.
He's brushed it with oxygen.
Dessert would be a marshmallow with a Cadbury's button on it.
  That's it.
  Of course you can't eat it, you just...
You lick it a molecule at a time and it...
At least the bastards probably starved to death so did some good!
It was arty farty food, not for hungry Northern men.
I remember a lot of boil in the bad things in the '80s.
I remember going on a diet, lean cuisine, it was all boil in the bag.
The pizzas were terrible!
I think that inadvertently I had so many E numbers in the '80s
that I am now literally allergic.
I mean, no, literally physically allergic to granola and alfalfa
sprouts and tofu because my body doesn't know how to...
Doesn't know how to digest them. They're alien...
If it's not orange
it won't know what to do with it.
My mum used to really buy into advertising, so anything that was flashed up
on the screen we'd get, so you'd eat this gorgeous food and then, "Fiona, I have given you a Pop Tart."
A Pop Tart, they're beautiful!
In the '80s grump making irritations were everywhere we looked.
On the telly there was Paul blooming stupid Daniels whom we enjoyed, but he was right, not a lot.
It was the first time round for Noel Edmonds with Swap Shop.
It was the start of BBT, Breakfast Bloody Television.
You're watching the first edition of BBC television's Breakfast Time,
Britain's first ever regular early morning television programme. A very good morning to you all.
Bringing dreadfully cheerful presenters into our living rooms when we least want them.
Bright, informative, the natural way to start the morning.
And if the wooden presenters were not bad enough,
in the '80s the best jobs on TV were going to puppets.
Stupid green pointless squeaking irritating pile of furry shit.
I hated Orville...
..really with a passion. I could properly get angry.
Look at this, say hello!
I think people should have gone to 10 Downing Street and done something
about it, or just burn the (SOUND DIPPED)! I hated him.
Anyway, you didn't film that, did you?
I can't seem to do anything right.
I don't feel very well, you know, it was all that... Like we care!
I wish I could fly way up t the sky, but I can't.
  You can.
  I can't...
I wish I could fly way up to the sky.
I can make you fly, stick a firework up his arse and send it into space.
He used irritate the life out of me.
What was the nappy all about?
What got me is they released a single which did very well.
The whole skill of ventriloquism is that you look at it and you go, look, his lips aren't moving!
Look, isn't it cute, isn't that clever?
You don't listen to ventriloquism, you don't buy a CD of ventriloquism because where's the trick?
It's like buying a CD of Paul Daniels.
What was entertaining about it?
What was entertaining about it? I'd like to throw darts at it.
I'd like to set it on fire.
I'd like to have an Orville bonfire party.
Why's it funny? Because it's furry and you've got your hand up its arse?
That guy with the emu thing, I mean, God spare us.
And I can only guess
Rod Hull had sex with Emu and all the children
became these puppets that took over TV.
He begat Gordon The Gopher and Roland Rat,
they're the illegitimate offspring of Rod Hull and Emu.
And all of these puppets in the '80s were all
invited on to, like, you know the Wogan show or Parkinson or...
I mean, this is how big they were.
I mean, you'd have Muhammad Ali one week, Emu the next.
Did they all sort of divvy up all the animals?
Has anyone had dolphin?
A pet dolphin?
What have you got to say, Dave The Dolphin?
Oh, it's genius(!)
A dog.
  Fantastic.
  Oh, please!
You see, if you did that now you'd have the Tourette's Society at you.
What it is is a dog that spits uncontrollably.
Tourette's. The dog have Tourette's, basically.
A level of genius with puppets like Spit The Dog because they've...
They've got ventriloquism at a point when really it was
past its music hall peak by some distance, and then they gone I know how we can revive it,
we cut out the bit where he says anything, which is the one bit that...
The one bit that makes it entertaining, "Oh, he can speak without moving his lips!"
No, we'll cut that bit out and just have a bloke going...
How does he do it?
The '80s was a decade full of iconic moments and iconic characters, but perhaps
nothing quite sums up everything that is regrettable about the times like this chap.
Hello, Ratman here.
Yes, that's right, breakfast television was in trouble
and it was the first time in recorded history when a rat actually joined a sinking ship.
Bring on the stars, yeah!
BBC television has a new star, a personality of great versatility by the name of Roland Rat.
Well, I mean, I saved TV am so I thought it was about time I came and saved this place.
I see it as my mission in life, actually.
He was the Simon Cowell of the '80s. He sort of had total television dominance.
'Roland's contract means he'll work at the BBC for three years making
'Christmas specials, variety shows and situation comedies.'
And if you were in your formative years at precisely that moment, heaven help you.
You know that question that people are always asked...
What was the first record that you bought? And people always have some
brilliant thing that was their first record and to this day that's special to them.
My first record was Roland Rat's Rat Rapping and I feel like I've just so missed out on that
beautiful moment and that beautiful treasured memory in your life of your first record
because mine was all about,
Let's find that flea, chase it up and down right to the knee."
"Run around till you catch it, locate the itch, then you scratch it. Yeah, rat rapping!"
When historians look back at our television entertainment to see what it has to tell them
about the times, what you have to wonder will they say about a culture where people thought this amusing?
Oh, the fun they'll have at our expense, what simple folk we must have been.
You always got the impression with Freddie Starr that no one knew quite
what was going to happen, what was going to go on.
I mean, obviously often it wasn't very funny,
but at least there was an element of some peculiar sort of danger.
Was he going to say something so offensive
or was he going to, you know, get his genitals out or something.
There was always that edge of...
It never did happen, it was just rubbish.
  Can I... Can I have some of this?
  Please, please.
He would do things like just start pouring a drink
and letting it overflow, while Des tried to ask him a question.
Des found it hilarious, I can tell you that much. Des was cracking up.
I've been told...
Sorry!
History has a way of making us look back in anger at some of the things we used to do and have regrets.
We're not very proud about slavery or what we did to the aborigines,
but just as you thought your embarrassment couldn't get worse,
someone discovers something in the archive.
Dr Loggins, Dr Loggins report to delivering stand, we have a mother cabbage in labour.
Dr Loggins to delivery stand.
They're just had to be a cabbage patch birth while we were there.
  It's a baby girl.
  And no disrespect to our lovely friends across
the Pond they're, but they were sick people buying these things.
They were born from a cabbage patch, weren't they, and they'd come with a certificate of bornality.
The adoption ceremony is a clever ruse to encourage prospective parents
to believe, or make believe, that the doll actually has a life of its own.
Cabbages, lovely.
Cabbage Patch Dolls, no, they were ugly, they were...
And what was the... What was the whole premise of them?
People would adopt them and they'd go, "This Cabbage Patch Doll
"is like a child to me and I will change its nappy, and we got two these kids."
I solemnly promise...
To be an understanding parents.
To be an understanding parent.
Here's the prescription for the baby for TLC, which is Tender Loving Care.
They were hideous...
awful, horrible dolls with woollen hair and they looked like this.
Something spooky going on here.
Things that adults find grotesque kids often quite like.
Those dolls used to scare me, those Cabbage Patch Dolls used to freak me out.
I never got my daughter one, I don't think I allowed them
in the house because they looked like little weird monsters,
like talking cabbages, the stuff of nightmares.
'As for the children who've been given a different version of how babies were born,
'they seemed more than a little perplexed by the day's cabbage patch delivery.'
There were thousands of screaming children.
It was like Bay City Rollers concert. It was like...
I'm dating myself! But it was like screaming kids fighting, elbowing
to get these little Cabbage Patch Kids because they all had names...
There were no two alike and it's, like, oh, you know?
I did not get that at all.
I did not get that at all.
It's crazy in there, yeah. They trampled everybody.
As life in the '80s got so bad you turned to the advertisements
for some light relief only to be greeted by one of the most vexatious ad campaigns in history.
Hello. Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm having a dinner party and I've run out of coffee.
An attempt to make instant coffee sophisticated through the "will they, won't they"
relationship between an affluent couple who were so smug that all you wanted to do was smack 'em.
Will Gold Blend be too good for your guests?
Oh, I think they could get used to it.
It's a very sophisticated coffee?
Thousands of us tuned in, apparently, to find out
whether or not they were going to do it.
I just remember them being really subtle
and there's nothing explicitly stated.
I think it's supposed to be romant...
Like it was really subtle. When you look back at it now it's just really blatant.
  Hello?
  I want to see you... Now.
Will they, won't they? And it was all a little bit smooth and a bit shiny.
Will they, won't they? Well, I don't know! It's coffee. What? What?
These smug,
superior yuppie pricks.
I don't care. I don't care if they got it together, I don't care if
she didn't drink coffee, I don't care if you didn't answer the door.
I don't care.
Well?
It deserves to be savoured.
  Pity I have to leave.
  Leave?
I'm on the first flight to Milan in the morning.
And the implication is that she's going to miss the coffee.
You're going to Italy, home of the...
espressos and cappuccinos and macchiatos and delicious freshly...
Instead of the freeze dried granule crap he's been giving you.
  That's terrible.
  Why?
  They don't serve Gold Blend in Milan.
It was all dot dot dot sentences. I was thinking that...
Do you fancy another cup of...
  What?
  Have you got time for a quick...
Yes?
Well, maybe we could...
You can't resist my co... Coffee.
"Have you got Gold Blend?" "But of course." It was all of that.
It was just absolute tat.
For God's sake just binge drink, have a shag on the stairwell
and ignore each other for the rest of your tenancy.
Today they'd be in bed humping, him holding a whip and her going,
"My God, I need a cup of coffee after that."
These characters obviously people must have considered them sympathetic characters, you know?
Which just speaks very badly for all of us.
We look at these people and their...
Two business class tickets to New York. That's like... Oh.
I thought, look, yuppies, stop fannying about, any real man
would have just said, "Look, love, you've had your coffee now so get on all fours."
No, I never understood the correlation between coffee
and getting off with somebody because I didn't drink coffee.
A friend of mine still teases me. When I asked him for advice about relationships
he said, "Oh, you know, mate, you've just got to say to them, you know, come back...
"Come back to ours for coffee and that leads on to something always."
And I said, "But I don't like coffee, Andrew." And he went,
"Well, ask them for something else, then. And I said,
"It doesn't have the same ring, does it, come back for a Ribena."
He went, well, look, just say coffee and, they'll know the subtext.
But I said, but that's a lie because I won't have coffee.
And he went, it's all about lies though, isn't it, mate?
But these were primitive days and we ad to make our own entertainment and so the '80s gave birth to
a whole load of awful gadgets and devices
getting ready to irritate for the next three decades and counting.
One, two, three go!
First there was the Walkman.
I ask you...
How much human misery has been caused by this stupid device
which made a fortune for a lot of Japanese people and scrambled the brains of a billion kids?
Everybody had to have music everywhere they went.
Was it like that in the 19th century?
Were people on horseback being followed around by a string quartet?
"Keep up, could one of you go either side so I can get a stereo effect? Thank you."
Now, here's another new idea, a little cupboard that you can put
food into, it whirls around a few times, seems cold on the outside,
but when you pop it into your mouth you suffer second degree burns.
Yes, that's right, it's a microwave.
Can that have been as recent as the '80s you're asking yourself?
  Well, yes, it could and our Alan was a little bit saucy even then.
  Do you need a temperature probe?
  No. There's no substitute for a prod and a poke.
  A prod and a poke.
  I'm so glad you said that, Rosemary.
  That's right, yes.
But if having microwaves in your kitchen seemed a bit discreet,
how about a new form of telly that you could receive by turning
your garden into a mix between Fylingdales Early Warning System and Jodrell Bank?
'From their home in Worcestershire the Smith family can view the world, for sitting in their garden
'are two huge satellite dishes picking up television channels from 30 different countries.'
Yes, we were glimpsing the future, and it sucked.
And technology was about to introduce us to another clever
little device that would drive us to distraction for years to come.
A remote controlled television, isn't that marvellous? The new technology!
Because in the old days if you wanted to change the channel you had to get up and go over to the set and turn
a button and go back again, wasting possibly seven seconds, and now you
can do it in 45 minutes going, "Maybe it's down the back of the settee?"
By the '80s we'd been conned into throwing away the vinyl for
the cassette, throwing away the tape for the eight track, throwing away the eight track
for the mini disc and finally we'd arrived at the ultimate format for our music collection, hadn't we?
I think it's quite telling the way CDs were sold
that most people believed it, this stuff,
they're indestructible, you could do anything, you could spread Marmite on them, you can sit on then,
you can shove them up a porcupine's arse and they'll still work, and of course the slightest little scratch
they're useless! Just useless.
You might as well get all your CDs and burn them. They're useless!
And there was the blessed mobile phone, then an unmistakable sign
of the prat and now positively ubiquitous.
They were, like, bigger than bricks.
They were just the most huge pieces of apparatus you can ever imagine.
Smaller high frequency transmitters means that you can have smaller telephones.
These were the days when walking down the street and talking to
yourself could get you locked up in a mental institute, this was before
they closed them down, but maybe the term mobile was a bit of an exaggeration.
Anyone remember these?
When you saw those early mobile phones you just thought, well, this is...
I'm never going to have a mobile phone, this is just not ever going to happen. It's pointless.
Nothing's that urgent.
It took 16 hours to charge it up and you might be able to talk for 15 minutes.
So I must have made about...
Excitedly made about, I don't know, 30 calls or something on this giant
great big thing and not spoken to anybody, for a vast sum of money. Very useful(!)
You suddenly talked too long and suddenly you'd get this throbbing pain
and you get heat coming all the way round the base of your skull
and you used to feel like you'd been cooked slightly.
And it had a battery life of about 40 seconds, didn't it?
  Just enough time to go, hello, I'm on the train.
  I'm on the train.
No, I'm on the train.
Yeah, I'm talking to you on the train.
I remember once on a train seeing someone like, you know,
propping it up, his whole body going, "Hello, hello?
"I love you! I love you!"
And I remember just thinking, tosser!
"No, I'm actually just between...
"Just between Oxford and Kingham.
"I'd say probably just between Oxford and Kingham on the train.
"Yeah, no, no lead, no. That's great, isn't it?"
But we're getting ahead of ourselves because before the advent of mobiles there came this.
Citizens Band Radio was basically a convoluted way of
one nerd telling another nerd that there was a police car behind them.
Except that saying there's a police car behind you would have been too simple.
Yeah, the CB radio, what was that all about?
It seemed to me that like you could invest in loads of equipment and go
and sit in your loft or your shed and talk to some lorry drivers.
Who needed to do that? I didn't.
It was odd. It was just a lot of children speaking to truck drivers, which now,
they'd be an electronic tag on your leg faster than you could say, "Meet me by the bins, I'm 37."
I didn't have a CB radio, I had a... I had a life!
I had a CB radio in my Cortina.
It was a green one and I had a big floppy...
It had a big aerial... You had to have a big floppy aerial
It used to flop all over the place.
'Breaker one four, Breaker one four. Anyone got a copy on a mean machine there?'
One four four, copy. One four four, copy. Come back.
Hi, good buddy, what's your handle? My handle, Funnyman.
I've got a couple in the area, Riley.
What's your 20 there, break?
I had a CB radio. I was living in the lower side of Manhattan.
I wasn't going anywhere.
I'd just get on the radio, Breaker one nine, Breaker one nine.
Then some trucker on the east side would be, like, yeah, what?
Yeah, Mr Laugh? I'm going down the seafront in Yarmouth. Good buddy, bring it on.
It's all coming back to me.
No, negatory on the indicators, Break, Break.
OK, good buddies, you got your ears on? That was when...
Or in... Or in...
Back in the real world, hello.
10 four for a copy, Roger, Roger, good buddy.
Any chance of an eyeball at Bolton services?
One... One four for a coffee sugar britches, do you got your ears on?
You've got the big H. Give us some 44s and 88s, out.
Eyeball, eyeball. Eyeball what, love? Eyeball...
Whatever you're eyeballing. I don't know, eyeball an eyeball.
I'm just coming up to this little roundabout...
We had somebody two doors down who had a CB radio
and radio would cut in to the stereo, so I'd be listening to Barry Manilow,
singing Could It Be Magic...
Flopsy Bunny, Flopsy Bunny, 10 four.
Oh! Flopsy Bunny, 10 four, are you copying?
Come into my...
Flopsy Bunny, 10 four, 10 four. Are you copy, copy, copy?
Yes, the '80s, Lord forgive them, brought us arcade games and video
cassette players and the beginning of the end of the sacred pen and ink and the beloved manual typewriter.
Yes, and a strange looking creature from outside of the shower brought
us the Amstrad word processor and changed our lives forever.
I had an Amstrad PC 9152, which basically if you put...
Was lots of green letters on the display, black with green letters.
If you put the printer on the whole house shook.
I had a complaint from a neighbour who came in and went, "What are you doing?
"Like, my house, the windows, man?" I could hear them rattling!
I think I caused subsidence up and down Clapham with that computer.
You could sort of put Shakespeare in the spell check and 20 minutes it would offer up sheep shearer.
I loved my computer at the time.
I had a ZX Spectrum, Sinclair ZX Spectrum. 48K.
16K was a piece of shit.
I had, probably towards the end of the '80s, I'd got an Amstrad
computer and I quite liked it because it felt a bit human to me in that you'd sort of...
You'd ask it to do something and then
this green light would flash and it would make
this sort of noise that sort of duh, duh, duh, duh, duh noise
and it felt like there was sort of some old bloke in there going, "Hang on a minute...
"What do you want? Page 5? Hang on."
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
"Oh, there's two. Oh, God, my back's gone.
"Three. Hang on, I'm going to crash."
And I quite...
I quite liked that, really.
I remember those Sinclair computers.
I think they were Sinclair, anyway, when you used to have a tape cassette and you'd have to load it,
plug it into your television for about two hours, and then you'd have that tennis game where you had
two sort of straight bats on either side
and you just knocked a ball backwards and forwards.
I mean, that was crap.
The games were so lame, and the dot wasn't even spherical.
Imagine not being able to make a dot spherical!
Oh, let's get the ball, it's square isn't it, dad? No, it's a ball, son.
And it's a square cursor.
Shit, man, you could have more fun with the delete key now.
We had a BBC Acorn which wasn't bad.
I used to play text adventures.
Like, you are here, there's a troll waiting with a club, left or right?
There was no pictures!
No pictures, just text.
An elf offers you a sword, do you take it? Yes.
Now, humankind has doubtless been responsible for producing
some colossal waste of everyone's time.
There's been the Sinclair C5,
the hula hoop
and Noel Edmonds
but probably the prize for the biggest total waste of time in history must go to this.
Hard to believe, isn't it?
A multicoloured plastic cube which was so baffling that we
all got repetitive strain injury trying to sort it out. I ask you!
Have you got three hours to spare that you really just want to fiddle about with a plastic cube?
Because any kid that could do it, and they'd be like this.
Smart Alecs, like that really, done, you know?
Not me, that was me trying to get them out of the cellophane!
I had several Rubik's cubes. I had the book.
There was a kid who had a book about how to solve Rubik's cubes
and I read his book and the Rubik's cube remained unsolved.
I was really good at Rubik's cube because I knew the secret.
You'd throw it against the wall, and then you put it back together.
I think Rubik's cubes really were for boys, weren't they?
I mean, you could count probably on less than one finger the girls
that spent their time doing the Rubik's cube.
To be fair the boys were spending their time on that
because otherwise the hands would be doing something else.
I got to a point where I was doing it in under a minute from...
From absolute scratch because I wouldn't let it beat me.
It had annoyed me so much that I couldn't do it
that when I got to do it I really wanted to smash it up
and do it as quickly as I possibly could.
Seriously, though, isn't it amazing that all this stuff was only 20 odd years ago?
It beggars belief to reflect on it.
Gay still meant happy, it was still a little bit weird to see Morecambe and Wise sharing a bed together.
  It says here international film star Sophia Loren has turned down an offer from Sir Lou Grade.
  Oh, yeah?
She said the grass was too damp.
And we whispered ever so softly the idea
that that bloke off the telly might conceivably be a homo.
I think there was still a huge number of people in Britain
that didn't believe that homosexuality could really exist.
It was so... Even if someone paraded around...
..pushing a vacuum cleaner singing that they want to be free...
..really they were just, ooh, a sort of a very theatrical type.
I want to break free
I want to break free...
They didn't really connect that with doing that thing.
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face but I've come through...
I just remember thinking Freddie Mercury and going,
"Of course he's gay!"
We are the champions, my friends...
Of course he is, he wears leotards!
How could he possibly be straight in a thrusting leotard?
How could we have missed that?
We are the champions...
The astonishment when Freddie Mercury finally said he was gay, in a band called Queen
and he's got a moustache and tight trousers going, "I'm in Queen.
"I've got a revelation to make." What, what? "I'm gay."
No, it's not possible!
...of the world.
A friend of mine was in a record shop the day Freddie Mercury died.
He was in a record shop in Derby and he went to this record shop
and there were all these guys, all these rockers had gathered in...
in this record shop in Derby, and they were all saying to each other,
you know, they're saying Freddie was a poof.
They're saying Freddie was a poof and he wasn't.
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye...
They didn't believe it, they just couldn't believe it.
And...
His band was called Queen!
Just got to get right out of here...
Working class men were watching at home,
I've been hitting metal all day, I'll have a can of lager from Makros, and watch John Inman.
I do wish you wouldn't interfere with my equipment, you'll get us arrested.
If they'd have thought they were watching an actual gay man
they wouldn't have been able to watch it the homophobia was so rife.
I'm right behind you, Captain Peacock.
I'm right behind you, Mr Lucas!
I'd rather you were behind Captain Peacock!
And when we look back now it's just so obvious to tell from mannerisms
and little quirks and we can just tell who's gay and who's not
and we celebrate it now, but back then the average white working class male very uncomfortable with it.
Yeah, but I can't talk to you now because I'm at work, over and out.
Mr Humphries, your whole lifestyle never ceases to amaze me.
'John Inman, for example, who was...
You know, couldn't have done more to have said how ridiculously gay I am, but people...
My Mum and dad never thought he was actually gay,
they thought he was hilariously ridiculous.
Argh!
What on Earth are you doing, Mr Humphries?
There's a mouse round my drawers!
They might go, "Ooh..." but they don't...
"That's... He's acting, he's just... Ooh, he's a card."
Do you really want to hurt me?
After watching Top Of The Pops and seeing Boy George sing for the first time on Top Of The Pops having
a seriously heated debate the next day with my classmates as to whether or not it was a boy or a girl.
Obviously, at about 12 or 13 years of age, you know, the fact that he
was called Boy George was a bit of a giveaway.
We kind of missed that bit out.
Do you really want to hurt me?
He turns up, basically dressed as a woman with lots of make up on,
which bit does everybody get stuck on?
Shall I tell you what is so very, very sad?
It's that we all thought we looked so cool, remember? We really did.
Seriously, here we are looking like refugees from a '50s space movie,
all padded shoulders and Wonderbras,
and then there were the women!
No one really understood the shoulder pads. I don't think they still do.
They're coming back, that's the thing.
The resurgence of the '80s is scary because they're taking
all the bad stuff from the '80s and bringing it back.
Is someone having a laugh, do you think?
The one on the left looks like the Honey Monster.
How are you going to wheel your trolley round Asda looking like that?
It was an era of looking really ridiculous.
You had this peculiar shape, be really wide at the top and then quite
narrow at the bottom so you looked like inverted triangles!
It was... It was so unflattering.
It was all the power dressing, and you had to have something to balance that candy floss
so I'm not sure what came first, is it chicken or egg?
Is it the hair or the shoulder pads because I've got a head like a pin.
I've got a tiny baby's head, so if I had those big shoulder pads
then you have to have something up here to counter that.
You needed landing strips either side of your shoulders.
That was serious shoulder pad.
That was serious power dressing.
Although it was that sort of sad concession, although feminism had
finished its journey and women were sort of realising we are never going
to earn the same amount as men, we are never going to win this battle, so the fashion were...
I suppose it was kind of a concession.
'We're not going to pay you the same as Jeremy,
but your shoulders are the same shape as his, so, swings and roundabouts."
She may be a woman, but she's businessman shaped.
They were metaphorically balancing a large penis on their shoulders...
..in the boardroom.
Because the shoulder pads made them look like an inverted triangle,
so they were actually emulating the male shape in a way, only more so.
God, listen to me!
Germaine Greer, eat your heart out.
I should be a social commentator.
You would turn on the TV and the news would be being read by an American
football player! Just someone with...
Looking ready to sack the quarterback any second.
The success story of the decade in Britain and now...
I look like I'm something out of a Third World country from the Army.
I've got these flying buttress that are out the side that probably make me look like I'm a scrum half!
They're so enormous I'm surprised they even managed to get me in the screen.
It must have been a head and then this vast expanding area of shoulder pad out to about there.
Ridiculous.
No wonder people used to say, "You always look so much slimmer in real life!"
'And, you know, the only thing is when you think
about the fashions of the 1980s, I think that's the only reason there wasn't kind of a major revolution.
It's very hard to storm the Winter Palace wearing leggings,
pixie boots and those shoulders. You'd never get through the doors!
Hello, remember me? Leigh Bowery.
Would you like to come into my dressing room?
The jacket you're looking at is rather interesting in that the gold fringe is made from
Kirby grips.
I'm an avant garde designer and I think things should be larger than life.
It seemed to be if you dressed absurdly people thought you looked great.
That sentence has a clue in it, which is the absurd bit, surely.
This is my next outfit.
You may notice that the rear end is rather exaggerated.
But retrospectively you look back at it and think, "What were we doing?"
We literally were pandering to the fashion gurus of the time
and who the hell were they?
Demented souls they must have been.
So, there we are then, the '80s.
A decade we need to remind ourselves about if only to learn the lessons and never to make the same mistakes
again, never to elect someone who's going to make us embarrassed to be British...
You ain't seen nothin' yet!
to avoid mind numbing visual vomit on the telly,
to resist the temptation to have our music sung to us by a performing fruit,
to not be taken in by apparently novel but essentially preposterous gadgets,
and, well, Roland Rat.
All lining up to compete for the worst thing about the decade,
but none of them has a chance because the worst thing about the '80s,
the very worst thing that happened for 10 years, well, there's simply no competition.
The mullet was a very powerful contraceptive, I believe.
But, you know, there are certain things in the history of our culture
that are inexplicable and the mullet may be one of them.
Luckily for me I'm black,
we didn't have mullets.
What I had was a shit Afro.
And now if you go to certain parts of Europe they still sport the mullet.
It was an extension of what was quite a good hairstyle,
which was that it was very short here, and then it went long, but not ridiculously long.
It was the Germans who did all that, Karl Heinz Rummenigge
who had stupidly long hair, and it was generally curly German hair some reason,
which then became the preserve of porn films through the '90s... I'm told!
Hair shortish on top, quite long at the back, permed at the back,
straight on top, so that was like an uber mullet.
'If you hunt hard enough, maybe go to Norwich, certainly if you go to Australia,
you will still see, they're very rare, a couple of original mullets
still in their natural nesting habitat.
I saw my first great mullet for many years the other day, which is...
almost a skinhead on top, and a full curly bush of mullet at the back, which is greying,
which proves it's an original mullet, just nesting in its natural habitat at a sports shop.
For me the mullet wasn't just an unattractive hairstyle,
which I think is now universally agreed it's not...
It's not the best of looks, but for me I had a...
I had a serious, almost bordering on physical adverse reaction,
to seeing people with mullets.
Oh, God, a mullet, can you imagine? A mullet.
Somebody with a mullet, a big mullet and a beard with no moustache.
I've gone a bit wheezy thinking about it.
Has anybody got an EpiPen?
It's like candy, candy
It's like candy, candy
Whoa, whoa, yeah yeah
Why you do
Yeah, you do
You're like a brand new feeling
In a special way
A surprise package
On a bright clear sunny day
And wrapped up tight
(so good)
Yeah, yay, yay...
