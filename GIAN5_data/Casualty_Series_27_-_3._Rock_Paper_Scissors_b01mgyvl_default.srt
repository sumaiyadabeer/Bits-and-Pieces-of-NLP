What the hell was that? Swatting flies?
Good move.
She's got you now.
Use your grappling skills, Sam.
  Sorry.
  Don't apologise, you've just floored the UK's number two.
Yeah, well I think someone was making it easy for me.
No, genuinely. You had me.
We might stand a better chance of winning
if we put Sam in the fight tonight.
  You can count me out.
  For now.
  Hey, Mel. Watch your back.
  Yeah.
  Did you forget to sleep last night?
  I took him out on the pull.
I wouldn't describe it
as "pulling" exactly. It was, er...
What would you describe it as exactly?
Er, spending the evening
in the company of a woman.
I would have loved to have been a fly on that wall.
Thank you very much.
Right, we can take him up when we're ready.
Great. I'll let his parents know.
Oh, don't you look like the cat who got the cream!
  You got a new fella?
  No. I've just had my appraisal with my supervisor.
Did somebody get a gold star?
She praised me for being efficient and running a tight ship.
I can't hang around chatting all day.
I have my standards to maintain.
I'd like to give you a kiss.
You all right, love?
Ah, gravy!
Mayonnaise, mayonnaise.
Pickle. Pickle tickle!
You want to dance with me? Dance with me e...
Come on, sunshine. I've seen enough.
No, no. Get off me.
What do you mean, you don't get it?
Is it Muay Thai, wrestling, kick boxing, what?
All of the above. It's Mixed Martial Arts   MMA.
It's like Rock, Paper, Scissors.
One could be good at floor work, like wrestling. If they're pitched
against someone who's good on their feet,
  or punching and kicking...
  Whoa!
..then their best shot at winning is to get them on the floor
  and work for a submission.
Well, it's not really a suitable sport for women, is it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have we gone back to in time to Victorian England?
No, it's a scientific fact that women are built differently.
So your argument is based purely on biology, not bigotry?
Ouch!
Sorry.
You regretting having that fry up?
Yeah. Should've had two sausages instead of three, eh?
  I'll get you some antacid later.
  Cheers, mate.
And maybe a breath mint!
Another one of your conquests?
Couldn't possibly say.
So the only sport you like that involves women is The Chase.
She messaged me for a date tonight.
Score!
Look, I'm sorry. I'm going to have to go.
Yeah, yeah. I will. OK.
  Hey! How's the woman of the hour?
  Yeah, I'm all right,
but the toilets are backed up again.
  Great(!) Just what I need on top of..
  On top of what?
Nothing for you to get distracted by.
Come on, let's get you pumped.
  This is handy. Get something for my tea!
  What, meal for one?
Unfortunately, yes. But who knows what the day'll bring?
Ever the optimist!
  Nowt wrong with that, Dix.
  Till someone bursts your bubble!
OK, thanks very much.
Right, folks. We'll take it from here.
  I'll go and get a chair.
  Hello, what's your name?
Prince William.
Prince William. Ooh.
You had a little drink or two?
Does anyone know who he is?
No, I've never seen him before.
OK, right.
  Let's have a little look at this shall we love?
  Ah!
  We got any ID?
  No.
That's deep, but it doesn't look arterial.
Right, your Royal Highness.
I need you to lift your arm in the air like this.
All right, son? OK, good lad.
  Put your hands up.
  No ID, but look at these.
No, no, no! Just keep it elevated for me, eh?
Looks like he was someone's best man.
Yeah, well, he's ruined someone's day, hasn't he?
  Right, ready to move him?
  Yeah.
  Can I give you them, mate?
  Of course you can.
OK. On three. One, two, three...
Steady on, mate.
What exactly is the masculine pluperfect for slut?
You're wrong, you know.
What? Have I misdiagnosed you and you're not a slut?
No. Pluperfect refers to a verb. Slut is a noun.
OK then, clever clogs. Why don't you just admit you don't respect women?
Of course I respect women.
  Except when they want to play boys' games?
  I was only winding you up.
Sam.
  Yep, what have we got here?
  Got an unknown male.
  I need something...
  You need to stay in there, mate.
He's inebriated. He fell into a wine display,
which is why he reeks of it. He's got a bad cut to his upper arm.
I need something!
What do you need?
My horse! I love my horse! He's called Prince!
OK. His obs are normal, he's not so keen on having his BP taken.
And his digital pulses and sensation seem intact.
Can I have my horse now, please!
Keep your voice down. This is a hospital.
Let's get him into CDU. He'll be a little easier to manage there. OK?
  You ever been that drunk?
  No.
  Oh, come on! You must have.
  No.
Well, in that case, you need to come out with me tonight.
  Get you on some shots.
  Oh, yeah?
  Yeah.
I think Tom's dance card is full tonight.
You keeping a tally?
Just keeping you on track.
Come on. You've got to find much more aggression.
I'm trying! Ugh! Stop being such a prat!
  Aggressive enough for you?
  Yeah. Keep hold of that for the fight.
  Ah!
  Cramp?
  Yeah.
  Come on, let's take a walk.
I know what you sacrificed for this fight.
Let's not go there, hey?
  It should all pay off.
  Of course it will.
Al's talking about setting up fights in LA and New York.
  If I win.
  WHEN you win.
I WILL win. Right, I'm ready.
That's my girl. Come on
Hey, steady. You taken on enough fluids?
  Yeah. Just... My head's...
  Careful!
  I can't stand up.
  Give me some help.
  Melanie? Mel?
  Oh my god, Mel.
  Get an ambulance.
Sorry, but that bloke we brought in earlier,
  we haven't got any details for him.
  What do you mean?
  He's drunk.
  Doesn't know his name or his date of birth.
  My crutches turned up yet?
  I sent Big Mac for them.
What exactly do you expect me to do with an unknown male?
  Not my problem.
  Easy for you to say.
You do you realise if a patient
is incompletely logged on to the system,
it increases the risk of clinical errors.
Louise ate the manual for breakfast this morning.
If you book him in with a number, it won't get in the way of his treatment.
There you go! Thank you very much.
Surely she's had an unknown patient before?
Of course she has. Just not from me.
  We're chalk and cheese, that's all.
  Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Don't even go there, Tamzin.
'Holby control to 3006.'
This is 3006 receiving.
'Are you available for a collapsed female?
'Rumbles MMA, Newbank Road. Over.'
Yeah, we're just clearing Holby ED now,
so put us down for show. Over.
It doesn't look like there's any deep structures involved.
You've been very lucky.
Do you know who you are?
I need to see my boss.
OK, well, if you tell me his name, maybe we can call him for you?
Nope, OK.
How much has he had to drink?
Our Denise went out once and someone spiked her vodka.
She thought she was Peter Pan.
OK, let's book him in for an X ray
and I'll suture the wound when he gets back.
Let's put up another litre of saline for him as well.
Whoa!
Excellent(!) OK, well, hopefully that will sober him up a bit.
I'll book that X ray in.
OK, I'll change bays and get this cleaned up.
Are we going to see my princess now?
Yeah, sure. Your princess!
Look at this. Rebecca and James,
September 1st. The wedding is today.
  Hm, nice bit of bling.
  Fiver says it'll never happen.
  Mm, I'll have a piece of that action, Mac.
  You sure?
You don't want to upset your new bezzy mate.
Are you still keeping that up?
  There you go.
  Cheers, mate. Thanks for those.
  You're welcome.
Maybe it's best if I wait with the ambulance, eh?
Right, radio me if you need help.
  And don't go being a hero.
Can I just have a bit of room please, mate?
All right. Lie still, Hun. Just you relax. What's her name?
  Melanie.
  All right. Hiya, Melanie
I'm just going to need to do your pulse, OK?
I need to put this on your finger.
Can you tell me what happened to you today?
  Um, I...
  She went to the ground.
I thought she was just dizzy.
Is she on any medication or any drugs you know of?
No.
  Have you been feeling poorly, Mel?
  I'm fine. I just want to get up.
No, I need to check your blood pressure.
She's been training for a fight this evening.
OK. I'm just going to slip this sleeve off, all right?
I just need to get to your arm. Thank you.
That will teach you, doing too many sit ups! OK?
There you go, all sorted. Mind how you go, mate.
Hey, don't go putting any more muck on my nice clean floor, you!
Always fancied myself as a player. I got the speed, I got the footwork...
I wanted to be princess of my own kingdom.
Denise, there's a pile of vomit in CDU.
Can you cleaned it up when you get a minute, please?
So no one told you that Linda was Queen, eh?
She's always been like that.
  You know what her nickname used to be?
  Mussolini?
  Who?
  It's not important?
  No. Jammy.
  Jammy?
  Why Jammy?
  Can't remember why. Just was.
Discharges. What do you reckon that's Jammy's all about?
Don't know, but take a look at this.
A James Bowman and a Rebecca Bayliss
getting married today at St David's Church, at 4:30.
  Well done, sweetheart.
  Thank you.
  Fletch, give us a hand.
  Yep.
OK, this is Melanie Fox, 32, collapse. On arrival GCS 12.
Systolic 110. Pulse 60. BM of 6.
  And you are?
  Gavin. Her partner and trainer.
He panicked. I'm all right, really.
Well, why don't you let me be the judge of that?
OK, let's get her on a bed.
Excuse me, Gavin?
Yeah?
Can you come with me, please?
  I need some details.
What's her address?
26 Mason Road.
  Mason Road. What's her date of birth?
  19th of the first.
Gavin? What are you doing here?
Melanie collapsed. I want to be with her.
  I just need the rest of this information for...
  Where is she?
  Resus.
  OK, let's go.
  I'm trying to do my job!
  Then come with us.
Um, I'm a bit busy right now.
That's done, Melanie.
OK, well, let's get that off for a FBC, U's and E's,
and a venous blood gas.
And can we get a HCG, too?
  Yeah, why not.
  We're wasting time.
Look I know you want to get to the fight.
I can't wait to watch you tonight.
The quicker we get to the bottom of this, then we can sort it out.
Can I have a word, please?
Won't be a sec.
What are you doing?
  She's my friend.
  Exactly. You're too close.
  This fight is a chance of a lifetime for her.
  I get it.
But respectfully, don't you have the Unknown, Unknown to see to?
Fair enough.
Sam. I've phoned the church
and our Unknown, Unknown
is James Michael Bowman.
  Ah, so it's James, is it?
  And you'll never guess what.
What?
He's the groom.
  Ah, the groom!
  Yeah.
  Someone's in trouble.
  We should notify the next of kin.
  He might have some old records too.
Don't worry, Jammy, I've got it covered.
Did she just call you Jammy?
Yes, she did.
Have you had any signs of a urinary tract infection?
Pains when you pee, urgency to go, going too often?
Yeah, I've had all three, but now I'm hardly going.
She's been cutting weight, running, sweating in the sauna,
using diuretics.
What kind of diuretics?
I was struggling to get rid of a few extra pounds.
What have you used?
Where did you get them?
Off the internet.
  I haven't taken any in 24 hours.
  You're suffering from dehydration.
You're body has lost too much salt from the profuse sweating.
  The diuretics have exacerbated the situation.
  I know what I'm doing, all right?
You'll know the quickest way to achieve hydration is IV saline.
I'll get the nurse to set it up.
So what about the fight?
That's not looking very likely, is it?
That's it.
  What are you hiding?
  Nothing.
I swear to God if you don't tell me what's going on,
I'm going to knock you out.
The club's lost its council funding.
Without tonight's purse, we can't make next month's rent.
It's over, Mel.
No. No, it's not. Just go down to the arena and buy me some time.
  I don't know.
  What?
Are we just going to throw the kids out on the street, are we?
Hi, Al. Yeah, it's Gavin. Yeah, she's great.
Really looking forward to it...
What if he's badly hurt?
We don't know what's happened yet. Could be something and nothing.
  I'm looking for James Bowman.
  You must be Rebecca.
  Is he all right? I want to see him.
  You can go through very soon.
  What's wrong with him?
  I'm not in a position to say.
Can we speak to someone who can? I don't know if I'm getting married today.
Of course. Take a seat over there
and I'll get the nurse to come and speak to you.
You look very nice.
  Thank you.
  Come on, Becks.
  Let's sit down.
  It's such a mess, Dad!
  I know.
Hello.
Can you tell me what I'm doing here, please?
Ah, you're back with us. It's James, isn't it?
  Yeah.
  Well, OK. James, you're in a hospital.
I'm Doctor Sam and this is Linda.
How much have you had to drink today James?
Nothing.
OK. Well, what's the last thing you remember?
I was getting ready,
putting my suit on. Where's my jacket?
Don't worry. It's here.
Oh! I should be at my wedding! Ah! What have I done to my arm?
You've had an accident. We had to put a couple of stitches in.
An accident? I don't remember that.
Has anything like this ever happened to you like this before?
Lapse in memory, blacking out?
Er... Oh, man!
  I need to get to church!
  Whoa! I'm sorry, you can't leave.
Look, you're attached to a drip.
Please, I've got to speak to Rebecca. Let her know I'm here.
She's on her way. She knows. Don't worry.
Let's just take it easy, OK? Get back on the bed for me.
You need to just try and relax for me James.
It's going to be OK.
Linda.
That's strange. What do you think?
Well, there's obviously an underlying problem.
There's no head injury. He's clearly not drunk.
There's a change in his GCS.
Let's go through and book a CT.
  Hopefully that'll show us something.
  What are you doing?
  Well, your cannula has popped off,
so I'm putting in a fresh one in.
It must take over everything, all that training.
Yeah, it does. Every decision you make is all about winning.
How did you get that puncture mark?
Oh., I gave blood last week.
Right.
James Michael Bowman.
Sean Francis Miller.
The groom! I found out who he is! That's his fiancee!
Good for you.
I have to say, you show very little respect for my position here.
My priority is to deal with sick people.
I haven't got time for small minded,
anally retentive, administrative rubbish, OK?
Right, let's get you nice and comfortable, Mr Miller,
I got a feeling you might be waiting some time.
Yeah, just send the rest down as soon as possible? Thanks.
According to the lab,
  Melanie's sodium level is down to 125.
  That's low.
Sam, how well do you know Melanie?
Well we're not BFFs exactly, why?
  She's buying diuretics off the internet.
  There's a fresh puncture mark on her arm.
  She said she gave blood...
  You're jumping on the performance enhancing drugs bandwagon.
  No.
  No.
  Their gym has an anti drugs policy.
  You're barking up the wrong tree.
  Hard to know when you're dealing with a liar.
Let's just deal with the facts, then.
I did a little bit of research earlier
and found an MMA site. Have a look.
These are Melanie's stats. Now, she's fighting today at flyweight which is up to 8.9 stone.
But her walkaround weight is 10.8 stone.
So, she's dropped two stone in order to make the weigh in?
Yeah, the idea is that you pile it back on in 24 hours so you have a weight advantage over your opponent.
Well, I've heard guys at the gym talk about using IVs
in order to rehydrate quickly, but Melanie would never do that.
She's fully aware of the risks,
Website clearly got her information wrong.
Well, we'll soon find out. Come on.
Don't go in all guns blazing!
Tom!
Melanie, I need to weigh you.
I know my weight.
This is just for our records. Do you want to get off the bed?
Jump on.
There we are.
Ten and a half stone.
Back on the bed.
Have you used an IV to accelerate your hydration?
I was doing what I normally do, and it wasn't working.
So, you used an IV?
What was it?
Look, we just need to know so that we can treat you properly.
Five percent dextrose,
  but no harm done?
  Dextrose IV
can cause a further drop in sodium.
Add that to a body already deprived of salt.
That would cause your cramps and your fainting.
You've wasted my time. I've been treating you with misinformation.
  I'm admitting you for 24 hours.
  What! There's too much at stake!
  You can't afford...
  I can't stay overnight!
Let's run the first litre of saline.
Slowly.
This is Doctor Nicholls,
  she's been looking after James.
  Is he all right? Where is he?
  This way.
  What's wrong with him?
He's sustained a injury to his upper arm.
Nothing major, just a few stitches. Can I ask you...?
  Has anything like this ever happened before?
  Like what?
Well, when he came in he was confused, disorientated...
  He wasn't able to tell us his name.
  Oh. Don't be diplomatic, doctor.
What you mean is he was DRUNK!
Wait.
Excuse me.
Finally, you've shown your true colours.
It's not what you think....
Don't give me your excuses!
I've seen you these last weeks getting agitated...
  Well, there may be good reason for that...
  Yeah.
She's the boss's daughter, she proposed to HIM,
What are you going to say? Marry her? Or lose my job?
It's got nothing to do with the job!
  I said yes because I loved her.
  Loved me? What?
  So you don't love me now?
  I didn't mean that.
  Then tell me what DO you mean?
  What happened this morning?
  He got cold feet. Didn't you?
  I don't know what happened!
  You don't know?
You don't know? You've just ruined our wedding day.
And, worse,
you've proved everything Dad said to be true.
  Rebecca!
  No.
  Ugh.
  Rebecca!
  Linda will look after her!
You ok?
It's my wrist.
  Let's get that seen to.
  See what you've done now!
  I think you should go with your daughter.
  I am going.
There you go...
you're off the hook,
and I'm glad.
I'm sorry.
I swear I didn't do this on purpose.
Come on, Martin, you know I'd never do anything to hurt my girl.
Well, you did!
But better now than a year down the line.
I'll get you bumped up the CT list, OK?
We're going to get to the bottom of this.
If we could get James Bowman moved up the CT list
as soon as possible, that would be great.
Sam, can I have a word?
  Where's Tom?
  No idea.
I've got five minutes. That's all.
Alone.
  Please?
  Sure.
Um...I'll walk her to resus.
Listen, um...I need you to speak to Tom.
He wants to keep me in overnight.
  Hi.
  Hi.
  This ice will help your wrist.
  Thank you.
Here you go, just hold it there. That's it.
I look a bit of a fool, don't I?
No, you don't.
What was I thinking?
We'd not long lost Mum, then I went and proposed.
He was hardly going to say no, was he?
If he was genuine, he'd have suggested giving you a bit longer.
You know what? He did.
What?
You know me, impulsive, once I've made up my mind....
Maybe he was trying to get out of it back then.
Well, if he'd changed his mind, he should have been man enough to say so.
  Not get drunk on your wedding day.
  James said he'd not had a drink today.
Yeah? Heard that one before.
  Becks, where are you going?
  To find James.
He needs to know this is all my fault, not his.
Rebecca, wait.
Noel, will you find Sam for me?
I think it's best you wait here.
He's annoyed about the IV.
Well, what do you expect? You lied to him.
Look, I really need tonight.
Surely the promoter will re schedule the fight.
No, he won't!
First thing tomorrow, he'll be on a plane out of here, looking for the next young thing.
  It's dog eat dog, you know that.
  I wish I could help you.
  Sorry to interrupt.
You're needed in CDU.
OK, coming.
  Discharge me.
  What?
Look, just sign the papers, or whatever it is you have to do.
I can't possibly override another doctor.
Great.
Just great.
Look, I've got to go.
And I promise you, when I see him, I'll speak to him.
I thought you'd gone.
I nearly did!
I'm sorry, James.
  You've nothing to be sorry for.
  Is everything all right here?
Yeah.
I pushed you into marrying me.
I wanted it as much as you did.
But you got cold feet.
No, I didn't!
What happened?
HE SIGHS I wish I knew.
James?
Is it all right if I ask you some questions?
Can't they wait?
Not really.
Have you had episodes of forgetfulness in the past?
Who hasn't?
I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.
That's true.
Headaches?
Yeah, a few.
  Did you see your GP?
  No. I just took a pill.
Why didn't you say anything?
Sorry, folks, not exactly a stretch limo, I'm afraid.
OK, well, we'll get you through your CT,
and then we can finish the questions later.
This is all my fault. I put you under too much pressure.
That's not true.
All right, at first I was like, "What have we done?"
But the more I thought about it,
the more I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Is that true?
You're everything.
I wanted to get married.
I still do.
Well, it's not over till the fat lady sings, like.
He's right.
What?
Um...can you just give us a minute, is that all right?
Yeah, yeah, certainly, no probs.
The church is booked, people are on their way. We've still got time.
What are you saying?
Will you marry me?
Course I will, silly!
THEY CHUCKLE Then what are we waiting for?
  Let's do it.
  Yeah?
He's just cost me a fiver.
James...
You still need to go for your scan, I'm afraid.
I'll ring Auntie Joan, get everything back on track.
  Soon as you're done here, you and Dad meet me at the church.
I'll see you out.
Mrs Rebecca Bowman!
See you at the altar.
I love you!
Well, what about that, then?
Ah, love's young dream, my son!
We have had Melanie's Beta HCG results back.
She couldn't PU, so we did it on blood, and it's positive.
I knew there was something more to this.
  Do you reckon she knew she was pregnant going into this?
  Who knows?
But it could explain why her rehydration routine didn't work.
Are you sure this is what you both want?
Positive.
Hey!
The vicar says that's fine!
  Thank you, thank you!
  And don't forget these.
Will you take care of them?
And take care of James, too.
  Bye everyone, wish me luck.
  Good luck!
  Bye!
See you at the church.
I love it when a plan comes together.
Yeah.
James.
If I'm going to make the church, I need to get going now.
We need to have a little chat first.
That sounds serious.
  It is.
  What is it?
Have I got a pea for a brain?
Not quite.
Oh... I need to sort out a new shirt and jacket as well.
James, please.
  Well, just tell me what it is, and then I can get going.
  I need to refer you to the surgeons.
  Why?
  Sam, have you seen Mel..?
  Not now, Tom.
Actually, can you stay?
James...
You have a mass on your brain.
Which is responsible for the headaches and the blackout episodes.
A mass?
Tumour.
Is it? Um...
Can you do anything about it?
The neurosurgeons are going to come down and...
Er...discuss your options.
Well, they can discuss it another day.
I've got Becks waiting to say "I do."
James, please, wait, I can't let you leave.
  You need to wait a minute.
  Just get lost, all right?
  Excuse me...
  I said get out! All right?
Whoa! OK! All right.
  He's convulsing, let's get him on the bed.
  All right.
Easy, watch his head, watch his head.
  What's going on?
  Brain tumour.
OK, let's hope the convulsions stop
by the time we get to resus, yeah? Let's go.
Take it easy, James, take it easy.
And Martin said we should all go to the reception later.
That's nice.
I'd love a big wedding one day.
Would you?
Coming through!
Right, Linda? I need you.
  What's happened?
  He's not coming out of it.
  I found some old notes for him.
  Bring them in, Louise.
Ok, let's see what's happening.
  Linda, will you rig up some Manitol?
  Tess, Lorazepam?
  Yeah.
  Got it?
  Yeah.
  Yeah, airway's OK.
  Good.
Thank you. OK, Lorazepam going in.
Oh, are those the notes?
I'll take them.
Are you OK?
Right I'll get on to the neurosurgeons.
Louise?
You all right?
No.
Come with me, come on.
Let's get you in the chair, eh?
There we go.
Right, take some nice, deep breaths, OK?
That's it.
Nice, deep breaths.
Keep breathing, love.
We're just going to sit you up for a bit, so take it easy.
What's happened?
You've had a seizure, James.
But we managed to stabilise you.
That's not good.
No.
No, it's not.
Sam.
The neurosurgeons are still in theatre,
they're going to be a while.
Um...I've got it.
  Sure?
  Yeah.
Where's Rebecca?
Would you like me to ring her?
No.
Is Martin here?
Yes.
Would you like to speak to him?
Yeah.
Drink this.
I've sweetened it.
So what are you doing working in an ED
if you can't stand the sight of blood?
Blood doesn't bother me.
What is it, then?
When I was a kid...
teenager, really, I used to stick my fingers down my throat.
One day I went too far.
Vomited up blood in a room like that.
Resus?
But you've been in there loads since you worked here.
I haven't. I send Noel in.
And I've managed a route round the department to avoid it.
Until today.
  Are you laughing at me?
  No. No, no, no, I'm not.
Not laughing at you.
  Ladies and gentlemen, the big event of the evening.
First in the cage, Melanie "Fireball" Fox!
  I can't believe she'd fight knowing that she's pregnant.
  Well, the test came back after she bolted.
  So she doesn't know?
  No.
Oh, great. Well, look, I'll call Gavin. Let him know.
He won't let her fight.
Ah, wait... You know can't divulge that information.
  What am I supposed to do?
You can ring Melanie.
I can't, her phone'll be off. I'll have to go down to the arena, tell her myself.
Um...
Could you look after James for me?
Don't worry, I'll take him over.
OK, thanks.
Oh, Linda, if you see Martin,
  can you tell him that James is ready to talk?
  Yeah, sure.
Jammy!
So come on, then, how d'you get the nickname?
What is it, like a Jammy Dodger? You always wheeling and dealing?
All right, you've had your bit of fun.
What's the matter?
I was called Jammy. You know, Jammy Donut,
because I was chunky as a kid.
  I didn't know that.
Yeah, well now you do, so leave it.
Can they operate?
Seeing you like this is going to break her heart.
I don't want that.
Do you?
No.
She still has nightmares of seeing her mum slipping away.
I know.
Sometimes I hear her crying at night.
So tell her you were right.
What?
That I got drunk because I didn't want to marry her.
No, no. I...
You have to tell her that yourself.
Let's agree not to tell her about the tumour.
James, I don't think lying is the best idea.
It's a good lie to save Rebecca from all that pain again.
Are you sure that's what you want?
HE SOBS No.
I want everything to be all right.
But that's not going to happen, is it?
Make her hate me, Martin.
Will you do that for me, please?
Please?
I don't want to be the one to break my daughter's heart.
James is really sick, so either way, that's going to happen.
If I was her, I'd want to know.
Thank you.
  All right?
  No, I'm not all right.
You know I hate being called Jammy.
Bobby Blackwell started that name in juniors,
and I still can't shake it off.
I'm sorry. I promise not to do it again.
Yeah, d'you think you can manage that? 'Scuse me.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Well, that could be arranged.
This came for you.
What is it?
  Knock yourself out. Fletch.
  Mmm!
  I'm going to kill him.
  Thank you...
Gavin!
Gavin!
Gavin!
  Gavin!
  Whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going?
You got to let me through!
  You need a pass to come beyond this.
  I got a doctor's pass.
I've got one! I've got one.
OK, go, go.
  Gavin!
  You made it! She's doing all right!
  Gavin, you've got to stop the fight.
  What?
  Throw the towel in.
Do you know what's at stake?
Yes! But I don't think you do.
What? No, you can't go up there!
  No!
  Trust me Gavin, trust me.
  Stop fighting!
  Stop fighting!
  Get off me!
  Stop!
  You're pregnant, Melanie!
  Melanie!
OK, She's sustained a kick to the abdomen,
she's had five of morphine and Entonox, and she's pregnant.
Get her on a bed over there. Can I get an ultrasound, please?
Keep breathing for me, Melanie, you're going to be OK.
All right, Melanie.
We're going to move you to another bed, love, OK?
  Up there.
  Just wiggle your bum over there, please.
  On three, guys.
One, two, three...
  That's it.
  Are you keeping that bag of saline?
  Yes, please. Let's hang it up.
Can we get another line in, please?
  Sam, you're off duty, you need to step aside.
  OK, but I'm staying in the room.
  Is she losing the baby?
  Let's not worry about that yet. Pulse is 100, resp 24.
I'm just going to take a look at your abdomen, OK? Tell me where it hurts.
Ahh!
  How about here?
  I don't know! I don't know.
  What about the baby?
  I'm just going to check for internal bleeding first, OK?
It's going to be a bit cold on your tummy.
When was your last period?
  Um... Er...three months ago.
I should have known, shouldn't I? Should have known. I didn't know, I swear I didn't know!
It's common to miss when you're training so hard.
I'm sorry! I've lost us everything! Oww!
  Do you think I'm going to lose the baby?
  Listen...
It's a tiny thing in a big sac behind a wall of steel. Yeah?
No internal bleeding. That's good.
Wh... What about the baby?
If everything is all right. I want to keep...
  I want to keep this one.
  Have you had a pregnancy in the past?
Um... Last year. I had a termination. Bad timing.
I can't do that again. I can't do that again.
Look! There.
The foetus is still in the sac.
  I can't hear its heartbeat.
  You won't be able to with this machine.
  OK, but I need to hear a heartbeat, OK?
  If it reassures her, I'll get a Doppler.
Don't worry, Mel, we're going to look after you.
You're doing really well, OK?
You're fine.
All right?
Yeah.
Are you?
I'm fine. I just wanted to say...
..thank you.
You're welcome.
  And about what I said earlier...
  What?
Well...
Louise...
Half the time I don't listen to a word you're saying.
Back to normal, then.
Exactly.
Thank you.
We could start again.
We are starting again.
But this time it's you, me and the baby.
Well, that sounds pretty solid to me.
Like a champion.
You'll be under the obstetric doctors from now on, OK?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm really happy for you, Mel.
Do you fancy a drink?
I thought you had a date tonight.
That's easily sorted.
So, drink?
Well, after the day I've had,
  I'm probably going to need more than one.
  Good.
You can buy the first round.
All right, look. There is only one glass left.
D'you fancy it?
Fight you for it.
Mmm...no thanks, I don't fancy being ground and pounded for it.
  Rock, paper, scissors?
  All right, yeah, my game. You're on.
  OK, fine.
One, two...
  Whoa..! On three, after three?
  On three.
  Right, yeah.
One two, three.
Rock blunts scissors!
All right, all right, best of three, best of three.
One, two, three.
Yes! Best of three, even stevens.
  How old are you?
  I can't remember!
  OK, this is it, tie breaker.
  Thanks, OK.
  You do realise I'm going to win this one?
  Ready?
One, two, three!
Oh...
  What the hell was that?
  Hammer breaks rock.
That's not allowed! That's not allowed.
  I'm going to break you!
  Aah!
