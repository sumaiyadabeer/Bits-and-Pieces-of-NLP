It is a power battle, the cooling towers are a symbol of the struggle.
A struggle to generate enough electricity to keep the lights on
in the future and to stop coal pollution. We rely on the
electricity from burning coal, a third of our power is produced that
way. Ratcliffe power station in Nottingham is one of the biggest in
the country. The existing coal  fired power stations are still
important to our lives and to the UK's economy. Ratcliffe is one of
the biggest when it comes to emitting carbon dioxide and there
are people prepared to try to stop The plan was to shut the power
station for a week. There was enough food and water to do that.

cannot protect the infrastructure, if we cannot do that to ensure
there is a constant supply, there is a risk to the country. The first
effect of the emergency will be see in the darkening of city centres.
It's not the first time the power supply has been threatened. When

This is the story of a power struggle. For a future which has to

future of protest. It is a tale of extreme action on all sides. It is
Peter Bleksley was an undercover policeman for 10 years. We were
operating against the highest echelons of organised crime. I put
away hundreds of people for thousands of years, seized millions
of pounds worth of drugs, stolen gear and took weapons off the
streets and prevented murder. I think it was pretty... Yes, good
work. Mark Kennedy was an undercover policeman to. He dealt
with drug dealers but then his Met handlers moved him into the world
of the eco activist. Undercover police officers should be highly
trained, rare resources. In my opinion, they should only be used
against the most serious of criminality. Not against climate
campaigners who even a judge described as being decent people.
In 2002, the decision was taken it to use a highly trained officer to
infiltrate the ranks of the Climate Change group. Why are the
authorities treating what may be seen as legitimate political
protesters in the same way as terrorists and drug barons? Is it
because the are becoming too effective? Somebody somewhere
decided they want to blow up our boat and sink it. The French were
prepared to kill when Rainbow Warrior was sunk because it
threatened their nuclear programme. Navy divers found the ship's
photographer. Are we going down a road that climate activists with
the same Greenpeace sympathies are spied upon because of their
beliefs? There is not enough action being taken quick enough about
climate change the stock we are still producing energy by massive
plants burning fossil fuels. We are not doing anything quick enough.
The time was when this is what a climate change dunno looked like.
This is Ratcliffe power station, a banner and some chanting. It did
not even stand on the daffodils.    they did not. Now, there is also

For the film, she spent a year recording some of the organised and
determined techniques they used. Most people do not realise how
carefully planned the actions are. Stop the conveyor belts to take
coal into there power station and locked herself to machinery. What
happens if the machine news and you are attached to it with bike lock
around your neck? This was part of the plan they had for Ratcliffe
power station. Get 100 people, take Easter weekend, 2009. From midday
on Saturday, they started to arrive at a school building in Sneiton.
They were there to make final preparations for seizing control of
Ratcliffe power station. They would the people doing different aspects
of the occupation of the power station, some would be on top of
the power station, some looking at other places. The idea was to star
of the power station of fuel by occupying can there belts and the
people at the chimney could stop it being restarted. The visual element
was at the top where emissions were being stopped with the banners. It
would have been beautiful. What they did not know was at another

police decided to up their game to. They knew what was going on because
an undercover officer was in the building. We got plans of the site
and from there we were able to deploy a number of officers, in
excess of 15 used. I was staring out of the window when I saw then

had no idea his kind of thing could happen, it sounded like something
from a novel. I presumed we were as careful as we needed to be. You are
under arrest for aggravated trespass. The activists complained
about the way police acted that night, smashing doors and making a
mass arrest of 114 people. The police say they were prevented more
serious damage and injury. In terms of the equipment, trying to remove
people, we could have broken their limbs. It minimised risk of injury
and harm to the protesters and the people making their point. It
stopped damage being caused and it stopped any of the staff that the
power station and much of this is being injured. What they found at
the school was evidence of a well resourced and planned operation
they had stopped. Bandages, toilet roll. Safety helmets. They seized
25,000 items including lorries which would have round the gates to
get in. There was climbing gear, cutting equipment, enough food for
And their own steel door to replace the one they were going to remove
at the base of the chimney. And, of course, the tubes which tie arms
together to create a barricade. That is knowledge    with the
knowledge that police would not break limbs. It is what I would
describe as military in style. They were divided into six streams, six
groups, and we found there is plans inside where they were allocated
different parts of the power station for maximum effect.
Identified a bag. There were a lot of riot police. All we could do is
sit down together and hold hands Power stations are large complex
and quite dangerous places. And the people the work they are highly
skilled and know how to operate the power station save it. The last
thing you want is people running amock in the place with no idea of
how it works and how things have to be run safely. The police consider
it a successful operation and And among those arrested was an
undercover Metropolitan Police officer, Mark Kennedy name to
activists as Mark Stone. A handful of officers would have known an
undercover officer existed, none of them would have known who it was.
He was required to that day, he did not say much. Because he had been
known to people and friends with people for so long, I did not
question the facts he was who he said he was. Mark Kennedy was a
deeply embedded among the campaigners that he had formed
close relationships. Including a long standing girlfriend.
Relationships built on lies. thing that upset a lot of people is
becoming physically and emotionally involved with women who were
activists in order to keep the cover which is completely
inappropriate. What did Kennedy think he was doing? Every morning
when he looked in the mirror and shaved, did he never asked himself
that question? What am I doing here? What value for money and my
Nottinghamshire Police's success was ultimately tarnished by the
presence of the undercover officer from the Met who made the operation
possible. 27 of those arrested looked as if they were to be
charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass. The only one
not charged was Mark Kennedy. He got a text telling him the
undercover operation was over after seven years.
When my undercover career came to an end I was in a very dark place
for quite a long time. I do have concerns for his well being, I
think he probably feels that the organisation he once worked for is
now against him. Now Mark Kennedy has resigned from
the Met. Here he is, documentary film crew in tow, turning up for an
interview at BBC Radio Nottingham. Everybody now knows he was an
undercover cop, and that's because he tried to go on holiday with his
girlfriend after the Met took back his Mark Stone passport. She
discovered his deceit. His emotional response made him
national news. When his cover was blown last autumn, a campaigner
recorded his reaction. I hate myself so much, I betrayed
so many people. I owe it to a lot of good people to do something
right. Doing something right in his terms
led today to the collapse of the trial of six activists accused of
trying to shut down a Nottinghamshire power station. PC
Kennedy offered to give evidence Hello, Mark. Nice to meet you.
And in that radio interview, he again spoke about his betrayal of
the protesters he was spying on. I spent seven years with a close 
knit group of people, many of which became very good friends. I felt a
huge sense of betrayal. I still do. These are people that cared for me
and looked out for me. And people that still mean a great deal. We
spent many, many hours together doing some really great creative
things outside of the protest. I have heard him deny strenuously
he went native but I am sure he can understand why people think he did
because I've heard him on the radio saying he did great creative work.
Creative work? What is that about? Was he basket weaving, cross 
stitching? What was he doing? If only I had time in my undercover
career to do creative work, but I was too busy trying to get
Under the watchful eyes of police, there are pictures of Mark Kennedy
undercover, here on the left, chained to the railings of a
nuclear power station. He also drove a van load of protesters for
a Wild West type attack on a coal train. And taught them the arts of
breaking down fences and climbing. He denies he went native.
When I was Mark Kennedy, I spent a lot of years as Mark Stone. I'm
still working it out, who I am and who I was then. I always understood
my role as an undercover police officer. That was always the case
and there's been a lot of things said about me going rogue. It's not
the case. I was in a position that is extremely rare where I was on
the fence and saw both sides. What happened with Mark Kennedy
raises questions about the handling of his operation. His long seven 
year operation. Questions he himself has raised.
I certainly think there are some aspects that need to be changed and
more consideration needs to go into the care of both officers and the
people that are on the periphery as well.
You don't think you got enough support and understanding of what
it is like living a double life? Under certain circumstances there
needs to be consideration going into that, yes.
Undercover policing is about treachery and betrayal. That is the
nature of the business. If you cannot do it, don't apply. However,
I think building up long term intimate relationships with people,
which is possibly what happened in this case, I think that is
extremely unwise, I think it is morally reprehensible and I think
management will have very difficult The ramifications of what Mark
Kennedy did went as high as the Lord Chief Justice. The convictions
were overturned against 20 activists.
The convictions have been quashed so we are utterly relieved some
justice has been done. There was evidence showing Kennedy
was playing a significant role in the group. He recorded
conversations which the defence could have used, but that was not
disclosed by prosecution. Nottinghamshire Police say they did
not hide anything. The allegations that we failed to
disclose I know are groundless. We did clearly disclose the
information around the undercover officer and the materials to
prosecution. The irony is when the CPS claimed
our objectives were publicity, actually, by their questionable
behaviour and withholding evidence, by everything that has been exposed
around police infiltration on protest movements who care about
climate change, they've generated more attention than we could have
So, after a massive police operation costing �200,000, and
half a million in legal fees, not a single activist has left with a
conviction. All of this for alleged crimes of aggravated trespass for
which the maximum sentence is three months in prison.
Most of the activists in question, if they are committing crimes, they
were crimes so minor and most did not exist 10 years ago, these are
very minor offences, aggravated trespass, which is refusing to
leave. This is not something that I think the wider society would think
warrants this level of policing. $$ WHITE Six inquiries are under
way into what went wrong. Everybody is concerned by the
Kennedy case. Two significant reports, one in two
undercover policing are expected to be published in the next few days,
not an easy time for those in the Met who ran Mark Kennedy.
If it has been scandalous and there's been all manner of things
going on on their watch, which they were not aware of, then they will
have to consider their integrity But what would have happened
without Mark Kennedy? What if the activists shut down the power
station? Another power station would be
called up to increase production or a power station would be brought
online that was not previously running. By doing that, supplies
are maintained and the lights stay Coal fired power plants continue to
pump out carbon dioxide. Ratcliffe sends into the atmosphere up to 10
million tonnes a year, giving it an unwelcome place in the Europe's top
20 of CO2 emissions, contributing to global warming. The power
industry knows it cannot go on, but environmental activists who want
coal burning to stop now. You cannot make the transformation
to a low carbon electricity industry overnight. These are huge
expensive investments that take a long time to get on the ground and
working, and that is the direction we are going but you don't get to
Ratcliffe six months on from the They called it the Great Climate
Swoop. New tactics, this time 1000 instead of 100.
There is no future in this industry. This time, they told everyone about
it in advance. The power station was fenced off by E.ON at great
cost. Emily James was there, embedded with the activists making
her film. The thing that really kept people
going was a knowledge of how bad the situation over climate is at
the moment. The divide between how serious the problem was and how
completely ineffective the solutions on the table were going
The police grabbed me from behind, and I shouted de arrest. All my
friends came to my rescue. I got away very fast. If more people as a
collective started to de arrest people, less people would get
arrested and the police would find their job much harder.
The police spent half a million pounds, twice the amount of the
raid six months earlier. Mark Kennedy claims he knew of 15 other
spies within the eco movement, but if any were still active, there was
no intelligence to stop what happened the week after the climate
power station and ended up at 4am, a convoy of 20 of us. We cycled
straight past security barriers, split into two groups.
Some chained themselves to coal conveyors. Others climbed the
nearer to reducing carbon emissions? Coal powered stations
are getting too old to carry on. The cost of renewing our power
industry with something less environmentally damaging is
enormous. �200 billion. That is the equivalent of building two Channel
Tunnels every year for the next nine years.
There are big question marks. Industry can't raise the money, the
companies don't have the sort of money. So, they have to go to the
financial markets to persuade people that the UK is the right
sort of place in which to make major investments in energy
infrastructure. And I ought to say that having protests groups closing
signal in that regard. New ways of generating electricity
are already happening because of an EU directive. At a cost added to of
fuel bills. Renewables like wind power now produce almost 10% of our
electricity. The East Midlands is one of the biggest providers. They
also generate more protest. It becomes an industrial area
instead of a rural agricultural beauty spot.
It sticks out a sore thumb from all directions.
And then there is nuclear, now producing the same amount of
catastrophe, like in Japan this year. Environmental activists do
not want nuclear power, this was Hinkley Point in Somerset last week.
There were plans to build Britain's first new nuclear plant for 20
