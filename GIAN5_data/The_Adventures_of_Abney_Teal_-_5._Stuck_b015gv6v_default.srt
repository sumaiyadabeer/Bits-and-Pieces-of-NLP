Abney and Teal, how does it feel
To live in the park on an island?
It's just right for us, it's adventurous...
And it's home from home on our island.
It was a fresh and shiny day on the island.
Just right for being busy.
Abney was busy hanging things up in the trees.
Hmm, hmm, hmm...
Hangy hang...
Hmm, hmm hmm, hmm...
Hmm, hmm hmm, hmm.
Neep!
And Neep was busy helping.
Neep!
Bop was busy blowing bubbles.
The Poc Pocs were busying popping them.
And so was Neep.
Neep!
Neep!
  Wee!
  Neep!
Woo hoo!
Teal was busy playing with an old tyre she had found.
  Neep!
  Wee!
Neep!
Wee hee! Look at me, Abney!
Very clever!
Wee!
Wee!
  Do you like my...?
  Oops!
..ornaments?
I'm hanging things in the trees.
Yes, they look great. Watch this!
Woo!
Neep!
Neep! Neep!
Wee!
  Neep!
  Woo hoo!
Oh, dear.
Woo hoo!
Keep rolling me, Abney.
  Wee!
  Neep!
Faster! Faster!
Woo hoo!
Wee!
  Neep!
  Ta da!
Neep! Neep!
  Neep!
  Let's have another go!
Thanks, Bop.
Bop tried to give the tyre back.
But he couldn't get it off.
Oh dear!
Try wiggling it.
Bop didn't much like being stuck.
It was uncomfy.
This is not very good.
No, it isn't.
Maybe we could unstick him.
Neep.
Neep! Neep!
  Neep!
The Poc Pocs had a go at getting him out.
Neep!
So did Teal.
Hmm! Nnngg!
Nngg!
Neep!
So did Neep.
Neep! Neep!
Neep!
Nee ee eep!
Abney had an idea.
Nee ee eep!
Neep!
Neep! Neep! Neep!
Neep!
Soap!
Yippee! Soap!
This ought to help.
Nice and slippery.
Then they all tried together.
But Bop was still stuck.
If we can't get him out, perhaps we can cheer him up.
Neep! Neep!
Neep! Neep! Neep!
Neep! Neep! Neep!
But Bop's still stuck.
What can we do?
Abney walked around to have a think about it.
Neep!
He walked past his things.
Neep!
Neep!
Neep! Neep! Neep!
And thought of something.
Neep!
Neep!
  String!
  Yippee!
THEY CHIRP String!
This way, everybody! This way!
This way!
Neep!
Neep! Neep! Neep Neep!
Neep! Neep! Neep!
What are we doing, Abney?
Wait a minute.
Neep! Neep!
Neep!
You pull that end and...
A swing!
Yes!
Neep!
Let's go!
Neep!
  Woo hoo hoo!
  Neep!
  Woo hoo!
Wee!
Woo hoo!
Bop could see further than he'd ever seen before.
  Wooh!
  Wee!
Woo hoo!
  Woo hoo!
  Neep!
He forgot all about being stuck.
Woo hoo!
Woo hoo!
And then...
  Ooh!
  Neep!
..He wasn't stuck any more.
Bop was very happy not to be stuck any more.
Good trick, Bop!
Neep! Neep!
Neep! Neep! Neep!
Neep! Neep Neep! Neep!
Neep! Neep! Neep!
Neep! Neep!
  Ah, that was an adventure!
  Yes, it was!
Neep! Neep! Neep!
