Now, in Round 8, you get the chance to treble what you bank.
Have the courage to vote off the WEAKEST link.
In a sudden reversal of fortune, David has gone from the strongest link in the last round
to the weakest link in this.
Statistically, the strongest link is Jenny, but who will be taking the final walk of shame?
Voting over. It's time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.
Jenny.
Jenny.
Sara.
  Sara, why Jenny?
  I think Jenny got two wrong in that round.
How many did you get wrong?
  Probably two.
  Yeah.
  David, why Jenny?
  Jenny did get two wrong in that round.
  How many did you get wrong?
  I got two wrong.
Well, David and Sara were much of a muchness.
They banked £20 and got two wrong.
Jenny got two wrong and banked £70, so she was actually the best player.
But it's votes that count. Jenny, you are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I was the strongest link in that round, mainly because I banked the money.
We all got two wrong, but yes, I've given them a little bit of money to play with,
which I hope they appreciate.
Round 8. In the bank, £2,100. In this round, 90 seconds.
Whatever you win will be trebled. You voted off the strongest link, you cowards,
so we'll start with the second strongest. That's Sara. Let's play the Weakest Link.
