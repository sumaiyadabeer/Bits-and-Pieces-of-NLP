There is a place,
not far from here.
I'm sure you know it,
it's ever so near.
and you will see,
a little gate,
to Mr Bloom's Nursery!
Hello!
This is my allotment There's such a lot to see
With my Compostarium there is no place I'd rather be
Have you been here before or not?
Well, let me show you what I've got
A spade, a fork, my wheelbarrow
Cabbage, runner beans, tomatoes and a marrow
A watering can, a trowel, some seeds
Radish, lettuce a couple of weeds
With my veg and plants I can sing and dance
See them sprout, watch them grow Pop along and say hello
There's so much they can teach us all
We'll laugh and learn We'll have a ball
It's such a special place to be
In my veggie
Nursery y y y.
  Waahhh!
  Shhhh.
When the wind blows, Raymond will rock.
Oh, my goodness, Raymond, are you OK? You sounded sad.
Oh, I'm fine, Joan.
Colin and I were just playing mummies and babies.
Can you guess which one I was?
You have the bonnet and dummy, so you must be the baby.
  And Colin...
  Mummy pea.
Do you think the tiddlers would like to play when they get here?
Perhaps they will. I hope they come soon.
You'll tell us when they're coming, won't you, Compo?
Thanks.
Right, now where were we? Oh, yes...
  Waahhh!
  Oh, Raymond, what's the matter?
I'm still pretending to be a baby.
  I was crying. I used to do that a lot when I was a baby.
  That's true.
  Yes, I used to suck on my dummy.
  That's right.
That dummy used to help you get to sleep.
You were forever having naps and falling asleep.
But now you're a bigger squash, you don't have naps, do you?
Raymond?
WHISTLING Uh... Eh... What?
What happened? What was that?
Oh, don't worry, Raymond. The tiddlers are here!
Oh, and Mr Bloom's got lots of plant pots.
Hey, it's Dasha, Hadi, and Jaya!
I'm very glad you're here today.
We've got important work to do.
  Can you guess what it is?
  Planting something?
I think you're onto something there.
We're going to take these plants, and pot them on.
  Do you know what potting on is?
  Yes. When the small plant
is a little bit bigger, we take them out of the small pot
and put them in the big pot to grow more bigger and more wider.
Right! Potting on is when you take a little plant out of a little pot
and you put it in a bigger pot, so that it's got room to grow.
These little peppers, they're going to grow up
just like those big peppers down there.
Jaya, could you be a very helpful tiddler and go
and get my gloves from the Compostarium? Ask into the funnel.
Some gloves for Mr Bloom, please!
  Oh.
  These are too small.
They are not my usual gardening gloves.
These are my lucky gardening gloves.
  Shall I put them on?
  Yes.
Ooh, it's a bit difficult. Have I got too many fingers?
  No, it's because they're too small!
  They are small.
You know, I used to wear these gloves when I was a tiddler.
I used to think that I couldn't make my veggies grow,
unless I was wearing them.
Then, one day, I lost them, and I didn't know what I was going to do.
Do you think that these gloves made my little seeds grow?
No. You took care of them very nicely.
That's right. Now, who wants to help me do some potting on?
Me!
  Come on, then, let's get your pots.
  I'd love to do some potting on.
That's good, Jaya. Now, grab your flower pots. Have you all got them?
  Shout, "Flower pot!" into them.
  Flower Pot!
Brilliant! Now they are ready to use.
Get some gravel and then pop it in the flower pot.
The gravel will help water drain out of the pot
and stop the plant getting too soggy. What type of sound is that?
Like a raindrop going hard on something.
Well, now that we've got our stones in there, we need some soil.
So get your hands in there and get a nice, big fistful
and pop it in your pot.
Take your pot and give it a little wobble.
Like that, just to let the soil settle.
I think we've got to take these seedlings and pot them on.
So, can you pass that down to Jaya?
And then Dasha, can you pass that to Hadi?
We're going to carefully pull this little seedling up.
  Wow!
  Pull him out and then catch him with your other hand underneath.
  That's it.
  Argh!
Hold him very carefully like this and then pop your little plant
down into your pot.
Now, we need to put some more soil in there.
  It's like the plants are moving house, isn't it?
  Yes.
And we need to press the soil down firmly, so the roots grow strong.
Well, done, tiddlers! I think we're all potted.
  There's one thing we've forgotten. What's that?
  Watering it!
Water   you're bang on.
Now, Jaya, hold up your plant.
I'm going to give it a water.
  There we go.
  Don't water it too much!
And then we'll water Hadi's.
There we go.
Then, Dasha, would your plant like some water?
Yes, over here, please.
  Now, there's just mine to go. He looks thirsty, doesn't he?
  Yes.
Let's give him a nice drink.
There you go, mate.
All right, Compo, we're coming.
Hear that? I think Compo's hungry. Shall we go and get him some lunch?
  Yes!
  Come on, then!
Grass and weeds and leaves from trees
Thistles that prickle and petals that tickle
Brown stuff, green stuff Sticky stuff, icky stuff
Crunchy bits, munchy bits Snappy bits, sappy bits
Yesterday's yums Chopping board crumbs
It's not fussy what's in its tum My awesome Compostarium!
It's full!
Keep together, tiddlers, it's going to go!
Do you want to come and meet the veggies?
  Yes!
  Come on!
  Meet the veggies.
  We're the veggies!
They grow here in my nursery
  Meet the veggies.
  We're the veggies!
Who've we got today, let's see? There's Margaret the cabbage
  Peepo!
  Raymond the squash.
  I love cuddles, you know.
And Sebastian's a singing aubergine
La, la, la, la Mi, mi, mi, mi mi!
Nice!
  Meet the veggies.
  We're the veggies!
Oh, they grow here in my nursery
  Meet the veggies.
  We're the veggies!
And that's not all. Oh, no, siree!
  There's Colin the runner bean.
  I'm speedy!
  The wee McGregors.
  He he he!
  So cheeky!
And I'm a beautiful fennel called Joan
Hello, my dear. Haven't you grown?
Ooh, don't forget the onions Potatoes and peas
Cos we provide the harmonies
  Meet the veggies.
  We're the veggies!
Oh, they grow here in my nursery
  Meet the veggies
  We're the veggies!
  And we love Mr Bloom!
  That's me.
  Right, tiddlers, are your hands all dry?
  Yes.
That's good. Come on then, let's go and see the veggies.
They might be a bit snoozy, as it's almost their nap time.
Hello, veggies!
Oh, hello, tiddlers.
  Hello!
  Are you all right, Margaret?
Oh, I can't sleep.
You must be hot. It's quite warm in here.
Margaret, are you sure you need to be tucked up under your blanket?
You're tossing around like a salad.
And turning like a turnip.
Hey, it's a good point, Margaret.
You'll be a steamed cabbage under there.
Hadi, why don't you go and get that blanket for me
and I'll put it somewhere safe later on.
Oh...I...need...my...blanket!
Oh, poor Margaret! I'll tell you what. It's all right,
Hadi, you hang onto that blanket.
And Dasha, could you give Margaret a nice big cuddle?
It's OK, you'll still get it back.
Hey Margaret, listen, you're a big cabbage now, aren't you?
You don't need to be all wrapped up, like a baby.
Oh, she does love that old blanket.
We all have things that we used to love when we were young, didn't we?
  What did you have, Jaya
  A baby bike.
  A baby bike?
  What colour was it?
  Green.
  Oh. You loved it very much, did you?
  Yes.
Hadi, what did you have when you were young?
  A teddy bear.
  And what was his name?
  Jack.
  Aw, and did you love him lots?
  Yes.
  Oh, nice.
  How about you, Dasha?
  I had a little teddy.
She was called Sarah, and she had a hat and a scarf.
Wow, sounds like you loved Sarah very much?
I hugged her all the time when I went to bed, when I was three.
Well, tiddlers, do you know what I had, when I was young?
I'll show you. I've got them here, actually.
Do you remember earlier, when Compo found these?
My gardening gloves!
I used to love using these, when I was a tiddler like you.
Oh, Mr Bloom, those gloves are far too small for you.
I know. But sometimes, because you get used to things,
you don't like to throw them away, do you?
I had a lucky hair clip.
Whenever I wore it, I looked fabulous.
Hang about. Raymond, didn't you used to have something
  that you used to carry everywhere with you?
  Did I?
Yeah, you definitely did.
I remember...
  Quick, Raymond, we're going to the Farmers' Market!
  Waahh!
But I can't find my fluff boodle!
Never mind, Raymond. I'll help you find it.
  Fluff boodle, that's what you called it.
  Oh, yeah, my fluff boodle.
Oh, you do remember!
No. What was it?
Remembering bean. Ha ha ha!
  No, Colin. Fluff boodle wasn't a lucky flower pot.
  Oh.
Tah dah!
  Or a lucky sock.
  Oh.
Hey, wherever did you find that, Colin? I've been looking for this.
  Finding bean.
  No, no. None of these are right.
You're right, Joan. That sock doesn't look very lucky.
Now, what was it that Raymond used to carry everywhere with him?
  Have you got any ideas, tiddlers?
  Violin.
  A violin?
It wasn't a violin, was it, Raymond?
  No.
  A teddy?
  A teddy?
  Did you like a teddy bear?
  No, it wasn't a teddy bear.
  Dasha?
  Fluffy cat.
  Fluffy cat? They're all really good ideas, tiddlers,
but they're not quite right.
Oh, of course. Let's just ask Compo, eh?
  Ooh, Jaya, can you ask Compo if he knows about my fluff boodle?
Thank you.
Compo, can you help Raymond remember about his fluff boodle?
I think Compo's got something to show us.
Oh, look, there's the screen.
Oh, here's the projector!
There we go.
Come on, tiddlers. Come and gather round.
I think Compo's got some pictures for us. Come here, Hadi.
  Right, can you all see?
  Yes.
Ready when you are, Compo.
Oh, who's that?
  That's me.
  It's Margaret, isn't it, when she was a baby?
Compo, can we have some music, please?
  Who's that?
  Colin!
That's Colin when he was a teeny, tiny baby.
Oh, Joan, you were a lovely baby.
  There's my hair clip.
  That's right. Can you see Joan's hair clip?
  Yeah.
  Hadi, can you see Joan's hair clip?
  Yes.
Cheeky Compo!
  Tiddlers, do you know who that is?
  It's you.
  That's right, it is me.
  That's Mr Bloom.
What's your teddy's name, Mr Bloom?
My teddy, he was called Peg.
  Peg?
  Yes.
  That's a nice name.
Well, he was a very good teddy to me   gave me lots of cuddles.
  Is that me?
  Yes, Raymond   and look what you've got with you.
Oh, it's my fluff boodle!
You've got Margaret's blanket.
Of course, yes! Margaret's blanket was your blanket once, Raymond.
I remember, now.
I grew up to be a big butternut squash, so I gave it to Margaret,
when she was little. Aw...
That was kind of you, Raymond.
Well, I didn't need it anymore.
Well, I never.
Wasn't that interesting, Margaret?
  Margaret? Where's Margaret gone?
  Margaret?
  Margaret?
Margaret? I don't know where she is.
  There!
  There she is!
Oh, shhhh! Let's listen.
  That will keep you warm, little onion.
  Ga ga ga ga.
  Ga ga ga ga.
  Oh, what a lovely thing to do.
I didn't need it anymore.
I'm growing up to be a big cabbage.
  Oh, what's that?
  A picture of Sebastian when he was a little baby.
  He looks so cute.
  Ah, that was moi, in my early days.
Oh, so embarrassing!
But I move on, I grow.
  Such is life in the garden. Mr Bloom?
  Uh huh?
  May I sing you a song?
  But of course, Sebastian.
  Hit it!
Margaret had a blanket She was sad to let it go
We were surprised to find that it was Raymond's once, you know
We've learned we all grow up Time keeps moving on
Now I think you all deserve to sing and dance and have some fun!
La la la la la la la la La la la, la la la
La la la la la la la la La la la
La la la
La la la la la la la la La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la La la la, la la la
La la la la la la la la La la la, la la la
La la la la la la la la La la la, la la la
We've had a busy day How the time flies!
Come on, Margaret, Colin, Raymond, Joan and Sebastian.
  He he!
  It's time for bed.
  Goodnight, Margaret.
Sleep tight, and well done for giving your blanket.
  Night night, Jaya.
  Night night.
Oh, that'll help me sleep.
Night night, veggies
Sleep tight, veggies
And listen to my gentle tune
Night night, veggies.
Sleep tight, veggies
We'll see you again soon.
