Good morning, dear. How are you?
Oh!
No need to worry. Everything will be ready on time.
I never miss an appointment.
See you tomorrow, dear. Cheerio!
Morning. Good afternoon, Mill Health Centre.
Karen, has Mr Jenkins arrived yet?
  Gone to the loo. He's got the runs.
  Lovely(!)
  Sorry.
  My fault entirely.
  How's your back today?
  Much improved, thanks to your ministrations.
  Mr Jenkins, if you'd like to come through.
Life in the old dog yet?
Karen, I'd appreciate it if you didn't compare me to an aging canine.
Erm...your first house call has just cancelled, Mrs Morton.
Again? Could you check her records for me?
  I thought you'd be pleased that somebody was feeling better.
  I'd be overjoyed.
But Mrs Morton is housebound with chronic rheumatoid arthritis.
My great aunt Ida had that.
Got so bad she had to go into sheltered accommodation.
It looks like Mrs Morton's pain medication ran out...six days ago.
I see.
Is rheumatoid arthritis...? I mean, does it run in the family?
You should hear my knees going up the stairs.
Honestly, it's like a bowl of cereal, all snap, crackle and...pop.
  Dr Carter? What are you doing here?
  I wanted to see how you were for myself, Mrs Morton.
Now, I've told you before, call me Zita, and I'm fine.
In fact, the best I've been for years. Look.
You seem like a changed woman.
No pain or discomfort?
I'm in remission, have been for weeks. All the old symptoms, gone.
  Remarkable.
  Come in for a cup of tea, I'll tell you more.
Alas, I've an afternoon of house calls ahead of me.
I'm delighted you're feeling better, but...
  Yes?
  It's just the speed of your remission.
You were in such pain when I saw you a few weeks ago.
Don't you believe the evidence of your own eyes?
Tell you what, I'll take you up on your kind offer of a cup of tea if you let me give you an examination.
How does that sound?
Better safe than sorry. In you come!
Come on, come on!
Finally!
What d'you mean, "Insufficient funds?"
No way! Not today!
Your recovery is remarkable.
There's some stiffness in your joints, but you're pain free, no soft tissue tenderness.
  What's the secret?
  Secret?
  Nothing I prescribed was doing much good.
It's all down to a herbal recipe
suggested to me by my grandson's Chinese girlfriend.
  Does wonders for me.
  Mm hm? What's it called?
  The remedy?
  Yeah.
A doctor likes to know what his patients are taking, even if he didn't prescribe it.
Now you're asking   the label was in Chinese.
All I know is it does the trick.
I hope your grandson didn't get it off the internet.
There's no knowing what's in these so called miracle cures.
If it's been imported, there could be illegal ingredients, toxic materials.
Don't worry. I get my remedy from a Chinese medical dispensary just off Hurst Street in Birmingham,
by the roundabout with the tall pagoda.
  Well, next time you're down there, can you get the name and a full list of ingredients?
  Will do.
So, how often do you take this remedy?
Once a day, dissolved in a hot drink.
I like to take mine in my tea.
Don't worry, Dr Carter.
I've had my dose for today.
  I just need a few quid for lunch, that's all.
  Sorry.
  Been burned lending money to gym buddies before.
  Come on, mate, I'm starving.
You still owe me 50 quid.
  Get my wages from the Icon tomorrow, I'll pay you then.
  Sorry, Jack. No more handouts.
  This is cos Lauren was more into me than you. You're jealous.
  Get a grip. She didn't mean anything to me.
  Yeah, right(!)
  Maybe you should take a break. Get your head straight.
Don't tell me what to do.
You can't push me around any more.
  Do you want some help with that?
  No, the council's meant to be dealing with that next week.
I thought you might like to share these with your colleagues.
I made them for a bake sale at my local lunch club, but I can easily rustle up another batch.
  Really, I shouldn't.
  Don't be daft.
Whenever that nice Dr West came to see me,
he always used to take a few of my brownies back to the Mill with him.
Go on, you know you want to.
Well, if you insist.
Now, I want you to call if there are any signs of your old symptoms recurring.
  There are no guarantees with a remission.
  I know.
I'm enjoying my new lease of life as long as it lasts.
Thought I was about ready for the knacker's yard, but now...
anything seems possible.
Thank you for coming, even if it was a wasted trip.
Oh!
You nearly frightened the life out of me!
Who was that? What did he want?
Dr Carter was giving me a check up, that's all.
  I'm home!
  What are you doing here?
Hey, I was listening to that!
Oh, what is that smell?
Boiling some chicken breasts. And I steamed some cabbage.
Can't you do that in halls?
You don't live here any more, remember?
Give it a rest, Immie.
You eating green vegetables, that's a first.
  Part of my new health regime.
  Not doing a lot for your complexion, though, is it?
Yeah, well, most girls don't need a trowel to put their make up on.
I'm fed with you coming back home whenever you like.
This isn't a drop in clinic for the terminally self centred.
Not my fault I'm the favourite child.
I'm sure Mum and Dad will pay poor little Immie some attention one day...maybe.
What's wrong? Truth hurt, does it?
  Don't forget to slam the door!
So your patient's had a complete remission almost overnight?
  Fascinating.
  Isn't it? I've heard of it, but not seen it for myself.
  Anyone want one of these?
  I don't want to spoil my appetite. I'm meeting a friend for lunch.
  Elaine?
  No, no, thanks.
Oh, well.
  More for me.
  I'd love to know which remedy your patient's taking.
Zita's promised to let me know.
  So you're coming round to the value of alternative remedies, then, Heston?
  I wouldn't hold your breath.
Oh, all the nutters are in today. It's taken me half an hour to get Mrs Rodriguez out of the toilet.
First chance I've had to draw breath. Are these any good?
Mmm.
Slave drivers.
Be with you in a sec.
  Mill Health Centre.
  'Mum, you have got to do something about Jack.'
I came home for lunch
  'and he's stunk...'
  Immie, I'm up to my eyeballs here.
  'Me, too.'
Jack's turned this place into a tip. I'm meant to be writing an essay for art history this afternoon.
  How am I...
  'Stop. I haven't got time'
  to play referee. Why don't the two of you try acting your ages for once?
  But Mum...
  But nothing!
Look, sort this out for yourselves.
I've got to go. I'll see you tonight.
Sorry about that. Teenagers, what can you do?
Karen, once you've finished with these patients, would you come and see me, please?
  The PCT stats are due in tomorrow and I still haven't had your data.
  Yes, Julia. Of course, Julia.
Three bags full, Julia.
So, where were we?
  You've made me look a right fool.
  What are you talking about, dear?
This! It's the wrong merchandise.
  Are you sure?
  Course I'm sure! I can tell the difference between this stuff and the real deal,
and so can my customers.
  Have a look yourself if you don't believe me.
Well, there's obviously been some kind of a mix up.
You don't say(!)
But if I've given you the normal brownies, then where are the...?
Oh, dear.
What are you going to do about this?
  Hm? I can have another batch ready in a few hours.
  You'd better.
I'll be back at half three.
Don't let me down again, DEAR!
Hello, Mill Health Centre.
'Ah, it's Mrs Morton.'
I'm a patient of Dr Carter's. Is he around?
Er...I think he's on lunch.
'It's just...'
I gave him some of my home baking after he'd made a special effort to come and see me,
'and I think he got a bad batch.'
Oh, so you're the lady who made the brownies. They are brilliant!
You've tried them? 'Tried them?'
They're amazing! Actually, can you send the recipe?
(Bother!)
DIALLING TONE Mrs Morton?
I went to the toilet for one minute.
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
It's not funny.
I was really looking forward to that.
  Some of us are trying to work!
Let's go somewhere lovely for lunch!
Tomorrow. I spent all morning getting cross examined. I want to relax.
I can think of something that will help with that. SMACK!
D'you mind? Can you two at least get a room?
  Sorry, Karen, she's not usually like this. Not at lunchtime, anyway.
  Don't be such a stick in the mud,
Jimmi. Jimmi. What's that song?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy...
What's gotten into you?
A whole box of brownies, for a start.
  Brownies?
  You're lovely, you are, do you know you are?
Sorry, I'll come back later.
  No, Elaine. Wait.
  No, it's OK.
No, I need to get Cherry into my room. She's toasted.
  Sorry?
  She's in a state of artificial bliss.
She's flying around on a Technicolor joyride.
  She's stoned.
  Oh! Oh.
I'm not, I'm just happy!
  Hello?
  'Yeah, it's Jimmi.'
Did you accept a gift of home baking from one of your patients?
  Yes, chocolate brownies from Mrs Morton.
  They're laced with skunk.
  Skunk?
  'It's a specially cultivated cannabis, it's about five times more potent.'
  Are you sure?
  Zita's a sweet old lady...
  You should know better than to accept food from a patient.
  There could have been anything in those brownies.
  Come on, Jimmi! Do you expect me to test every morsel?
  Look, talk to your patient, find out what she's playing at.
  Don't worry, I will.
Is everyone all right? No ill effects?
Nothing too serious.
Glad to hear it. I'll see you later.
Sorry if I gave you the wrong batch.
It's an easy mistake to make.
Yes, it is when you're baking brownies laced with an illegal drug.
Cannabis is purely medicinal.
Oh, rubbish! It's a class B controlled drug.
  Nothing medicinal about it.
  You doctors think you know everything.
  But you can't see the truth, even when it's as plain as the nose on your face.
  What do you mean?
It's the cannabis that has caused my remission!
I was online at my silver surfers' club when I read about cannabis inducing remissions.
I decided to give it a try.
Yes. Contrary to what you may think, madam, I am well aware of that study.
Its scope was limited, and far from conclusive.
I would need a lot more proof than that before I start giving my patients cannabis cookies!
Face it, Dr Carter, you're not really angry with me.
You're just embarrassed about giving my special brownies to your colleagues.
We take our responsibility to patients at the Mill very seriously.
We can't do that if we're stoned, can we?
I said I'm sorry.
You put lives in jeopardy.
Did you think about that?
You used to be a pillar of the community.
Head of a noted girls' school. How did you end up taking illegal drugs?
What choice did I have?
Rheumatoid arthritis was stealing my life, bit by bit.
I could no longer leave the house, I could barely fend for myself in the house.
I knew it wouldn't be long before you suggested I go into a nursing home.
Cannabis is not the answer.
So you keep saying. But what happens if you stop my supply?
How long do you think my remission would last?
  There's no proof it's responsible for your remission.
  But if it is,
don't you have a duty of care to safeguard my health?
Aren't medical professionals supposed to follow the principle of "first do no harm"?
I am not discussing ethics with someone who is knowingly breaking the law.
  Then we have nothing more to say to each other, have we?
  I have.
  Who supplies your cannabis?
  I want you to leave.
  Not until I get some answers.
If you won't go, I shall call the police.
I'm the one who should be calling the police!
You know, I could swear that wallpaper's worse than it was earlier.
Leave that be.
  This is piping hot!
  Really?
Well, it's mainly...foreign students who rent the place next door.
They must have left the heater on.
Trust me, this is a lot more than a forgotten radiator.
Just what's going on here, Mrs Morton?
The Incredible Sulk returns.
Have a good sleep, did you?
Eugh, you are disgusting!
Can't believe you've actually become more of a slob since you left for uni.
  Whatever.
  Oi, clean that up.
  Nag, nag, nag.
  You're worse than Mum.
  Why are you acting so weird?
  I'm fine.
  Then why take all that food? What's it for?
  Refuelling. For workout sessions down the gym.
  You, at a gym!
  It's not funny!
Yeah, it is.
Poor little Jack!
Did the 98 pound weakling finally get sick of having sand kicked in his face?
Ooh, truth hurts, does it?
Back off, Immie.
I said, "Back off!"
You were right to call. Either it's Day Of The Triffids next door
or somebody's using it as a cannabis factory.
Quite mature plants too, ready for harvest any day now.
And that's why the adjoining wall is so hot?
The plants need extra heat to help stimulate growth indoors.
How long have you known about this?
  Oh, I didn't.
  Oh, come on, Zita. That won't wash.
I've had a look in the kitchen.
That's a lot of brownies.
More than for personal use, I'd say.
I share them with other arthritis sufferers, that's all.
No money changes hands.
Mrs Morton, the more you tell me, the better it'll be for you.
All right, yes. I did know what they were doing next door.
But when I found out, he threatened to hurt me.
  But how did the cannabis end up in your brownies?
  They gave it to me for keeping my mouth shut.
  I'm so ashamed.
  Do you know the names of those responsible?
Could you describe them?
You don't understand. If I tell you anything, they'll hurt me, or worse.
Better call the drugs squad.
Are you expecting someone?
  Right. Mum's on her way home to sort you out.
  No way.
She wouldn't leave work just before afternoon surgery.
I texted her about how weird you're being.
  You did what?
  Acting all Jekyll and Hyde, nicking food, you're not yourself.
  Like I care what you think.
  What is wrong...?
  I spent half an hour hand washing them!
  Like anyone wants to see you in your pants.
  When did you last have a girlfriend?
  None of your business.
  Oh, no, you just prefer hanging out at the gym with the boys, pumping some iron.
  Drop it, Immie.
  You know what they say about big muscles covering up for.
  I told you to drop it, so drop it!
  Hello. Were you looking for these?
  You again! You'd better not be trying to steal my action.
  I leave all the action to the professionals.
  What are you on about? Where's Zita?
I'm sure these gentlemen can explain.
This isn't fair! I ain't done nothing wrong!
  "I haven't done anything wrong" is the phrase you're looking for.
  Craig Crumey. How long's it been?
  PC Miles.
  I should congratulate you.
Graduating from selling a few spliffs to running your own cannabis factory. That's a step up.
What are you on about? I don't run the cannabis factory.
  But you do know about it.
  No!
  It wasn't my idea.
  Are you sure it's safe?
  Oh, it's all right. The ringleader's under arrest.
  I'm no ringleader, I was just helping out. It's all Gran's idea!
  Craig! How can you say such a thing?
  Your grandson?
  You can't believe a word. An act, all of it!
  Take him away.
  I'm telling the truth! Gran planned the whole thing.
Please, you've got to believe me! I've not done anything wrong, honest!
She's dead persuasive and she said she'd give me the money.
I really appreciate this. I know you've got more important things to do.
Actually, you're doing me a favour, to be honest.
Don't think I could look at those PCT stats for a minute longer.
  Thanks for getting that data together for me, by the way.
  You're very welcome.
Right, I'll go and play peacemaker.
See you tomorrow.
I'm no expert, but I suspect with your exemplary background
and limited involvement with the cannabis factory, you'll probably only receive a caution.
And what about my grandson?
He's on much shakier ground, according to PC Miles.
I understand now why you didn't want to tell us who was responsible.
Before my daughter died, I promised I'd take care of Craig.
I knew he'd been in trouble, but I never dreamt he would threaten me.
You've been through quite an ordeal.
I shall miss my special brownies.
We can't be sure it was the cannabis that triggered the remission.
I promise to help you through whatever comes next, Zita.
You're very kind.
Julia, I've got a message from Jimmi. Seems Cherry isn't feeling well, so he's taking her home.
Why didn't he tell me himself?
  It came on very suddenly. Something she ate, I believe.
  That's just great(!)
I'm covering the desk for Karen and now Cherry's gone as well!
Why has Jimmi had to take her home? Couldn't they have called a taxi?
Not sure that would have been best. They did organise nursing cover for this afternoon's clinics.
  That's something, I suppose.
  Julia!
  All right, Elaine, please, there's no need to shout.
  Sorry. It's just...I had an idea for changing the waiting room area ambiance.
  I'm listening.
Well, you know how stressed some patients are.
I thought we could replace the chairs with beanbags.
Make them more relaxed.
No, no, I really don't think beanbags are the solution.
  They wouldn't be any good for our less able patients, would they?
  Absolutely, you're right.
I was thinking of the holistic approach, and not the practical. I'll just get back to my room, then.
What's wrong with people today?
Hello, dear. I take it you got my message?
Yes, poor Craig, but he is just collateral damage.
Losing the first crop, just a day before harvest...much more costly.
Not to worry, the other two sites will both be ready next week.
We'll have our bake sale soon enough.
Bye, dear.
Now, aren't you glad I took cuttings this morning, my dears?
You'll soon be sprouting lovely new leaves.
  Like you're an expert on sex!
  What do you mean?
  One week it's Elise, then it's Gio, the Italian Stallion.
  Which side is it this week?
  At least I've got friends, unlike some people.
  Get lost, Immie.
Why, what are you going to do? Show me what a big man you are? I'm not scared of you.
  Pumping iron!
  You don't know...
  I didn't get mugged...
  I'm home!
..by a bunch of nine year old girls. Pathetic, Jack Hollins. That's what you are...pathetic!
Out.
Get out of my house! Get out!
  Mum?
  He's gone.
How did it go with your patient?
  A long story. Let's just say it won't happen again.
  Glad to hear it.
  I understand from Elaine that Cherry had to go home sick?
  Yeah.
That's what we told Julia. Appreciate it if you'd back us up.
  Of course. I'll apologise to Cherry when she comes back. How is she?
  Ah.
  Dreamy, horny, potentially criminal, borderline hysterical.
  Oh, Lord.
It's OK, she's sleeping it off.
Right.
  So...how did skunk get into those brownies?
  Ah!
I don't understand.
What is wrong with him?
I don't know.
Auntie Ag said that he was acting strange, but I didn't listen.
  He punched me!
  I know.
Mum...can I sleep in your bed tonight?
Of course you can.
Well, well, if it isn't Jack Hollins? What the hell
  happened to you?
  Got in a fight.
We've got the place to ourselves.
I'm all yours.
You are in big trouble, mister.
