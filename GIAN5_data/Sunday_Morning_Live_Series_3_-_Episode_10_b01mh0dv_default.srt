Yesterday, squatting became a criminal act in England and Wales.
having their properties squatted, but with homelessness rising
sharply and three quarters of a million empty properties in the UK,
is it right not to allow squatters Good morning. I'm Samira Ahmed and
welcome to Sunday Morning Live. Yesterday, the Government
effectively brought an end to squatters' rights, introducing
negligence lags to criminalise squatting in residential builds. Up
to 50,000 squatters now face eviction, but with homelessness
rising sharply and hundreds of thousands of empty houses, is it
really immoral to squat? The Government has just announced
it is giving Ghana �87 billion as part of its overseas plan. Is
helping poor nations the right thing to do even when times are
tough? Nick Ferrari thinks we should put its own people first.
This country must put its own people first.
Last weekend, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, Harriet Harman,
made a speech attacking age discrimination against women on
television. Should older women try harder to ensure they stay on
screen in A warm welcome to my guests this
week. David Aaronavitch is a journalist for the Times and a

And Nick Ferrari is a broadcaster and journalist. Welcome to all of
you. You can give your views on Twitter or Skype or phone.
There are an estimated 50,000 squatters in England and Wales and
since yesterday new legislation has effectively made them all criminals.
But with homelessness a growing problem, is it actually immoral to
squat? Squatting as long been part of
British life, especially since the 17 century. These days, everyone
from the improvished to students camp out in empty properties. But
as of yesterday, squatting became a criminal offence. Squatters will
now face up to six months in prison and a potential �5,000 fine.
looked at all the available options and this is the clear most
straightforward and sends the clearest message to squatters that
you cannot steal someone else's home. And that's the message we
want to get across. Ministers say this new legislation will help
protect house owners and deter squatters. Up to now, trying to
remove squatters has been a long and expensive process and when
they've finally got them out, homeowners say their properties are
wrecked. They say their rights have to come first. However, critics of
the legislation, such as the charity, crisis, say that the
majority of people who squat are vulnerable and we should tackle the
cause of homelessness rather than criminalise the effect. And this
new law alies to empty homes of which there are nearly three 
quarters of a million in England alone and they are left to rot. Why
shouldn't people be able to use those houses?
So, this legislation is finally giving homeowners much needed
protect? Or is it a violation of human rights for the people who are
already vulnerable in society. Is squatting always immoral, Nick?
me, squatting is effectively a form of theft. If we're going to have
laws they have to work for everybody and clearly they've
failed house owners many times down the years. That is the subject of
our public vote. Is squatting immoral. You can vote by text, on
line and we'll show you how you voted at the end of the programme
Jenni, you've heard all these stories of homeowners and landlords
who have had their properties wrecked. You see it in the papers.
Does it make you bothered about squatting? No. The thing for me is,
first of all, I think there is a very important difference between a
homeowner and a property owner. And I think that, of course, stealing
is wrong. Appropriating someone else's property is wrong. And if it
is my home and I go away on holiday and I come back and there are some
strange people living there, yes, that is not correct. However. If it
is true that there are some 700,000 properties in this country that are
empty and not being used and there are people sleeping on the street
because they cannot afford to have somewhere else to live. That, to me,
is a much larger moral wrong. you see that distinction? No, it's
ridiculous. People who don't have jobs, does that mean you can race
to someone's office first and take over their job? Lots of people this
weekend are probably buying school uniforms. They're far too expensive,
do they take them off the shelves? That is wrong. You are nicking
somebody else's house and you shouldn't be there. Do you buy the
principle that it is theft? You can make that argument and I see it and
it's largecal force. But taking London at the moment, one of the
big problems we have is billionaires from abroad who buy up
large sections of property and keep them empty because essentially
they're an investment. So you have empty properties. And I find it
difficult, really, to be morally outraged that somebody goes and
lives in that property while it is not wanted. The difficulty always
is what happens when that owner might want the property back. In
London you have different kinds of squatters. You can have those who
wreck them and some go in and make a joy of the place, frankly, in a
place that is otherwise empty. own applies to residential property
not empty commercial property. Chris Town from the residential
landlords' association in Leeds, you've had first hand experience of
squatters and the troubles associated with it, can you tell us
what happened to you? Yes, I had a property which had just become
empty. The previous tenant had just moved out and before I could get
back to the property a squatter had installed himself. I didn't know
the law or how it worked. I was completely innocent of that and had
no idea what to do, so I rang the police, which I think most people
would do in a situation like that, not knowing the law. And the police
said I could do nothing about this person and in fact if I entered the
property I would be breaking the law even though it was my property.
Didn't you have to stake it out to get back in? Yes, the advice of the
police officer was that when the squatters left the property, there
were two people in there, a male and a faem, and if they both left
the property I could then make it secure and if they then entered by
force I could call the police. Which I did. It took several days
and ultimately they left the property. I boarded it up and they
re entered the property by breaking through the board I had installed
and I rang the police and they said, "We have no witnesses" so we still
couldn't do anything about it. get them out in the end, was it
�1,000? It was, but added to that there was damage to the property.
There was a small fire in the property which caused damage and
the important thing for me was this property was for let. It denied the
lawful use of the property by a tenant who wanted to move into the
property. When people say a lot of these people are landlords and own
lots of property, what do you say to that argument, that this is
about people who have lots and people who have nothing and they
need somewhere to live. Landlords who have property have to rent it
out for a rent. That's the deal, it's a business. Land lorpbdz don't
buy property to keep them empty, I certainly don't. We run a business.
And these are people who steal the property from legitimate tenants
and landlords and damage the property and that can't be right.
That's a particular landlord experience. I don't know if it's
typical or not. I've visited, as a journalist, several squats where it
doesn't fit that template at all, where there hasn't effectively been
a landlord waiting. I've been in large properties in leafy parts of
London where properties have been empty for four or five years before
anyone has gone into it and it's been bought up for development and
sometimes people actually get more money effect yvly by leaving
properties empty too. What is the truth about squatting? Exactly that.
I  thighs with what he went through, but I know personally and for a
fact of people who own 20, 30, 40, 50, 2hun47 properties which they
have for tax purposes and all different kinds of things. So there
needs to be a definite ringsation between what the property is bought
for. If you're like Chris and you're buying it to rent out or
live in that should be treated differently if someone squats in
that than if you've a Russian oil billionaire and you've bought
properties. That guy didn't look like a Russian oil billionaire.
thighs with him. I don't care if houses have been boarded up for 45
years, they've been bought with money. You can't go and take
people's properties it's just wrong. If you have laws they have to
protect everyone. I was talking to a teacher's assistant yesterday and
she squats because she doesn't get paid enough to have a property.
Many things in this world are unfair. Isle' right, we'll take
things out of the supermarkets because the prices are too high.
Where does it end. That's taking it to the extreme. David has a point,
if they have 45 houses, that's different, but you'd have to have a
very clever law to get through all that. And we have another viewer.
Uge is a former squatter. Do you have any sympathy for the
landlords? I feel sympathy that Chris was given incorrect advice by
the police. Before Saturday there was existing provision for people
like him. We haven't time to answer that now, but beyond that, what
about the principle that he had this ordeal to get the squatters
out and the mess they left him? Right now my greatest sympathy is
for the thousands of squatters who have become criminals overnight who
face the position of do they move out of their homes and become
homeless or do they face sudden eviction and criminalisation.
They're not moving out of their homes. They're moving out of
somebody else's home and that is why they have to move. But there is
a problem with lack of housing. doesn't justify criminal acts.
ahead? OK, is it a criminal act? It is a criminal act now. You think
that's wrong? You think people are going to be damaged by the law? The
idea is it's going to redress an imbalance. Are you really saying
that criminalising it will push it too far the other way? I think it's
disproportionate to make vulnerable people in society criminals. I
think that's disproportionate. Samira it's worth asking the
question why it is we have had this law that came into force up until
now? It came in in 1977 to stop people being evicted by skrup you
lus landlords. Exactly. We have country principles. One of the
reasons we called it squatters' rights is that if somebody sets up
a home there and lives there undisturbed for a while we
recognise that as their thom and that has been a principle in
English law for many, many years up until now. I read that one in seven
people on the planet is a squatter, so it is also about defining what
exactly is a squatter, when are you squatting, when are you developing.
Well, the Government has had to make a decision on this law. We
have Mike joining us, who was a strong voice pushing this law. It
is about social division. People who have lots of homes and leave
some empty and people who cannot afford to live? No, it's stealing
and we shouldn't be allowing it. Squatters tend to be web savvy and
well educated and they look on the internet to find the empty
properties. And squatters are not right. The owners are on their
knees calling for them to be removed. One old lady who was in
hospital had to spend �10,000 to get the people out of her house and
they union ruined it. Don't confuse squatters with homelessness. Do you
really want a homeless person to go into a derelict property? No, we
should be looking after our homeless and putting them into
local authority care and looking after them properly. So that's
50,000 more on the housing list, can this Government deal with it?
don't agree with that figure? If you look at the statistics, in the
last 50 years we've got the lowest homeless ever, apart from the past
two years. The Government has put millions of pounds into the scheme
for homeless people. We do need to look after these people, but they
are not squatters. Squatters are entirely different, they're
antisocial free loaders. Do you think that? Some of them are, and
some are not. I can see why it's politically attractive, but an
litcally it's irritating. Is it like the old right to roam, and the
idea of people walking across your land was considered outrageous
once? Landowners were incensed at the idea of the right to roam which
was one of the good ideas of the last Labour Government which said
people should be able to walk aCrosland. Land ownership is not
like other forms of ownership. In some ways it is and some ways it
isn't which is why we have distinctions in the law. There will
be aspects of this law that, within two to three years, we will begin
to regret. They will be in the region of what landlords do to
tenants and make them squatters, but we will regret it. Thank you
very much. It is our poll question today. One viewer says, "The full
force of our law should be used to rid the people in our houses when
they shouldn't be. Let's start with the House of Lords" that's another
question. Another says, "Why not increase
taxes on empty properties and nent vice people to use them." That   
innocent vice people to use them" much
That is the topic of our poll today. You have around 20 minutes before
the poll close. And the deputy Prime Minister has been putting a
ban on second homes bought in London, which is all part of the
discussion. This week, the UK Government will
commit �87 million to Ghana as part of its ongoing overseas aid commits.
But in this time of austerity shouldn't we be helping the
vulnerable and needy at home before countries overseas, or is it
morally right that as a relatively prosperous nation we should be
doing our bit. Here is Nick's Sunday stand This country must put
its own people first and if that means others around the world have
to suffer, well, tough. Autumn is on the way and with it
the party political conference season. Yes, that dreary annual
event in which our so called political elite fight and fret over
the issues they deem important to our lives, unemployment, the
economy, the environment, you get the picture. But foreign aid, a
scandal that costs us taxpayers billions of pounds that could be
spent saving the lives of some of our most vulnerable will get hardly
a mention. I present a daily radio breakfast
show in London and I had the Prime Minister in my studio just last
month. He was knocked for six when a woman who had just been diagnosed
with cancer asked why her local NHS Trust could not afford her drugs
but Britain could afford to fund sexual health clinics across Africa.
Mr Cameron had no answer. Oh, he waffled on about moral obligations
and not breaking promises to the poorest of the world. Well, I wish
he'd tell that to the struggling pensioners who are likely to die
this winter because they can't afford to turn up the gas or the
families living in poverty due to the cuts. The �12 billion he spend
on foreign aid could surely ease some of our domestic economic rot.
This is the perfect example of the distance between politicians and
ordinary people. How else can you justify sending �270 million to
India, a country with its own space programme, a country that does
little to help its own poor and with an economy that will be bigger
than ours before you know it? I like this saying, I hold it dear,
it might be an old one but it's still a good one, "Charity does
begin at home." If you have a webcam you can make your point on
Skype, or join in the conversation through Twitter e mail or text.
David, should charity begin at home? No. It's fundamently an
immoral statement and of course you don't really mean that. Nick
doesn't actually mean that his kid should have a third I pad if she
wants it rather than pay taxation in order to help the disadvantaged.
What it means is you keep all your money within this country. Firstly,
we are a rich country, despite the fact that we have people who are
disadvantaged. So we're talking about things like whether or not we
should help to eradicate malaria. And we've done a good job on that.
Should we not do it? What that be the moral thing not to do that.
Nick is saying no. I am, because we are in the ridiculous situation now
where we are borrowing money and printing other money to send to
other countries so we get ourselves deeper in debt. People watching
this programme may be about to lose their jobs and they are under
pressure. We have to wake up to that. Isn't the money, as David
says, going to people who really need it? Absolutely not. I agree
with Nick but come at it from a different angering. I grew up in
Jamaica and my father started an organisation on behalf of the
government, where he went out and they taught local people how to
produce things that were then sold. And so it is the old thing, give a
man that fish you feed him for a minute, give the man a fishing net
and he feeds himself for life. think aid is being badly spent.
Absolutely. I have a very close friend who is a member of a very
wealthy family in an African nation that I will not mention. And she
said to me, and her family are millionaires, and she said to me,
"The worst thing that we do in this country is the government giving a
lot of money to these countries because it almost never gets where
it is meant to get." I'll let David answer that. We have a significant
amount of effort trying to make sure that aid is effective. Not all
of it is, but quite a lot of it is. But most of it is not. No, you've
just said that off the top of your head. You don't actually know. We
do have a body that looks at the efficacy of aid. I'm certain some
of it is wrongly used but the chances are, the majority of it is
correctly used. I think money from charities is better than the money
the Government sends. That is a huge difference. I want to bring in
a contributor. Max works with ox families and governments and we're
talking about Government aid. Do you think we have focused on the
attention of the money getting where it is meant and there is the
question of admin. That's right. We're all under welcome scrutiny
over how we spend our money better. The vast majority of British aid is
spent very well indeed and there are concrete independent
parliamentary Montego toreing of that money. I've lived in Africa
for many years and seen the huge differences made. Think of HIV
where British taxes are keeping people alive all over Africa. These
are productive people, nurses, teachers, midwives. And if we take
that money away, we're calling on them a death sentence. I don't want
to know    I want to know, Nick, why we're being forced to choose
between ordinary people in Africa and Britain when the British
bankers are getting away with...Oh, The bankers, I wondered when we'd
get around to that. The reason we have to do it is because around
25,000 elderly people will probably die this winter because they can't
afford the gas bills. You've said it's marvellous we have people
working in Africa. I'm delighted for them, but it is sad we have
people in Britain dying because they can't afford the heat.
when you had the Prime Minister there you didn't ask him why he
didn't tax the banks more to help ordinary people at home as well as
in Africa. We also work closely with the poorest people in Britain
and I agree whole heartedly that it's scandalous that older people
who have worked hard all their lives have to choose between heat
and food during the winter time. That is a legitimate question to
consider, about bailing out the bankess, but I want to bring in
another viewer. Gordon has worked in international development and
the UN and the UK Government. Now, the Government has made this moral
claim that it's not cutting foreign aid, should we be applauding that?
No, because I think there is a tremendous amount of waste in
foreign aid. We could probably cut foreign aid by 50% and it would
benefit developing countries. But most people do not appreciate when
they support foreign aid that virtually all foreign aid goes
direct to governments in the form of budget or sector support.
Unfortunately this sort of aid is simply not auditable and it
encourages governments to divert the money to other activities and
we're unfortunately supporting a lot of corrupt governments. I
support it on a microbasis but once you go into giving governments
hundreds of millions of pounds you're encouraging waste and
corruption. Can I ask specifically about Pakistan, which is a big
recipient of UK aid, and foreign aid, and potentially it's supposed
to reduce terrorism, do you think that's wrong? It is impossible for
us to exert political power over foreign governments these days and
it's impossible to audit this aid. It's a very vulnerable job. And
although if they say they're auditing this aid they haven't got
the staff or the power to be able to assess the hundreds of millions
of pounds. We give �330 million to Ethiopia each year. Do you think
it's possible to audit that? They've just ordered 10 Boeing
Dreamliners. We could probably cut this aid in half. We need a better
foreign aid programme and properly audited. David? It's quite
difficult because it's clear you're going to have   I thought, actually
the amount of Government to  Government aid was 28% of the
budget and it's just been presented as the whole thing, but I might be
wrong about it. It is an disturb to say your aid to Ethiopia is not
actually well placed simply because their airline is now able to afford
properly airliners to connect their country. What about India and the
space programme? It depends what the programme is. India is a very
large country. I could conceive of the situation where we're not
aiding India in 25 years' time. point is, first of all, everything
that Gordon was saying I was nodding, nodding, nodding, because
from my experience of what I know he is completely right. I'm not
saying we shouldn't aid other people. That is what I think Oxfam
is brilliant for. It's government aid. He gave you a good example of
the aid of AIDS, Jenni. You must be in favour of that. Yes, but that
kind of aid, a lot of that is run by charities and monitored properly.
But like Mr Bridges said a lot of the aid that goes from Government 
to Government we cannot monitor it and we don't know where it goes.
I'm delighted to have a journalist from Uganda joining us. You're a
journalist at the independent newspaper out there. How do you
feel about what you've heard here and crucially you support aid but
you have been critical of how aid has worked in the past.
personally think that the debate in the studio is very limited. It is
concerned with how the aid    whether aid has been used well or
poorly. The point I would like to make is that aid is a function
instrument of the bod policy because aid tends to separate the
state from the citizens. It separates the Government for its
own people. If the government spends on its own people such a
government is driven by self  interest to engage its citizens in
improving productivity and gaining of wealth. So you're saying that
aid creates dependency and it should be targeted to encourage
people to use it in a more entrepreneurial way? On a broader
level, aid tends to en courage things in a way that the Government
searches for revenue rather than looking at the people, its own
citizens, as people who should bring in the revenue. Because the
government can get revenue by taxing its own people and if it
taxes its own people it will soon realise it has to make them
productive. So if you don't have aid you will greet a responsible
government to be productive. sorry for the quality of line there,
but thank you very much for joining us. My initial thought is that it
will be difficult for Nick to agree with that, because he wants to
encourage the same sort of welfare dependence by giving money to poor
people in Britain. You can see it is true. I'm not arguing that all
aid is well used everywhere, but I am arguing that a significant pour
portion of our aid is well used in many places. And in any case,
Nick's argument is not that it is well used, his argument is that
you're not under obligation to provide it. But if it is used to
reduce things that you hate, like Islamic terrorism what will you do?
That almost sounds like blackmail. Until last year, we were giving
money to Brazil and China. Giving money to China. We all know how
huge China is going to be. It just seems wrong. I think the idea we
heard from the former economist is there needs to be a greater
diligence over the money, I agree. But David Cameron has written an
entire page on the economy, not one word about the �12 billion on
foreign aid. Not one word. One viewer says, "Aid pro longs the
problem" another says, "Foreign aid should be cut I pay tax for this
country, not others." And another says, "Programmes that lift the
developing countries out of poverty and into the economy is well worth
being spent" Now, is ageism a problem aimed at
women in society at large or just on television? You can make your
views known by phone, e mail or on  line. And do keep voting on the
poll. You have about five minutes before
the poll closes. It's time for our moral moments of
the week when we can reflect upon the stories in the news. David, a
story in today's paper. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has come out very
critical about Bush and Blair on war crimes. Desmond Tutu pulled out
of an event in Johannesburg in the last weeks, having agreed to appear
at it, saying he could not reconcile his appearance with what
Tony Blair had done over Iraq. He has now written a piece in the
Observer, which has put it on its front page and he's further gone
into it by suggesting that maybe Tony Blair and George Bush should
be at the international war crimes...But His view is that all
the African leaders are put on trial and not them. Well that
applies to Charles Taylor who fomented a Civil War for certainly
game in a neighbouring country. This is a war in Iraq, whatever you
think about it, that took down one of the worst dictators in history.
And Desmond Tutu should tell us what he thinks Western countries
should have done about Saddam. this is about the number of people
who have died in Iraq? Undoubtedly. When Archbishop Tutu agreed he knew
Tony Blair was going to be on the platform. Tutu has not brought
anything new to the equation. People have been banging on about
it for a long time. There have been endless inquiries into Mr Blair's
activities. At the moment there seems to be no charges, can we not
just get on with our lives, I would suggest. Jenni, you've chosen a
story about a couple who have rented an indyafpb womb? Yes, the
first    Indian womb. Yes, the first thing that came into my mind
thought it must be wrong. This is a British couple who already had a
child and wanted another child and she was not able to do it so they
have rented a womb for �20,000 of a woman in India who will be the
surrogate. So the woman in India will get between �2,000 and �3,000,
so who is getting the rest of the money? First of all, I'm lucky
enough to have a child so who I am to tell somebody else that they
can't have another one, even though they already have a child, it is
not economics. But you're not against IV if F? No. I'm all in
favour of regulation. I'm not in favour of this woman's
circumstances and so on should be highly regulated because people
could be exploited and that's the issue. That's part of the problem
for me. But in straightforward moral terms. Firstly, with IVF we
have conceived the idea that people have some reproductive rights
outside of what we wood have regarded as normal pro creation
before. Yes. So can you utilities someone else's rights   we've had
surrogate motherhood before. So there is something about this
situation which is the extra moral factor which is causing the problem.
That's exactly right. To me I have a problem of renting a womb of a
mother in a foreign country and she is not getting all of the money.
And what about the Paralympics? This is one where Britain has a
great moral standpoint. In the US they're doing very restricted
highlights of the par Olympics and in Canada they're not showing
anything of the opener is moan for three weeks. In India a country of
over a billion pop police station they sent a handful of athletes. We
have the best part of 300 people. I'm an old newspaper man in every
sense of the word. When I came into the industry the idea of putting
people with disabilities on the front pages, I'm ashamed to see you
just didn't do it. Now we see people with no limbs and dwarfism.
Now we're celebrating it and I think that puts us on a moral
platform. Hrawi. Thank you very much. You've been voting this
morning over is squatting moral. Now the poll is closed so please do
not call because you may be charged. We'll bring you the result at the
end of the show. Last weekend, Harriet Harman, the deputy Labour
leader speaking at the Edinburgh Television Festival said it was
offencive and wrong that women were made invisible on television
because you were past your reproductive ages, is she right.
Julie Walters said at the age of 62 film roles for her were drying up.
And other actors have said that women over 60 are ignored on film.
And television has been even more vocal. Some speaking out include
Miriam O'Reilly, sandy Toksvig and Joan Bakewell who are all taken off
the television while male presenters can work well into their
advancing years. Mark Thompson, the outgoing head of the BBC admitted
However, undeniably many women on stage and screen starting out on
stage and screen are chosen for their looks, not their talent. Is
it right now to bite the hand that fed them so long or is television
simply highlighting a wider problem in society where women of a certain
age are ignored across the workplace or has the issue been
exaggerated. There are others who are not well represented in the
media. Should we not be focusing on them, rather than a select group of
women who have done very well for a long time. So, are women forced
from our screens after a certain time, or is this an issue that
perhaps people don't really care about? You can join in by webcam or
make your point by phone, text or exmail or on line. And we're joined
for this discussion by Susan O'Keefe, who had a long career in
television making programmes like World in Action and Panorama, and
she is now a Senator in the Upper House of the Irish Government.
Thank you very much for joining us. You were making documentries for 20
years, is this a problem or are we more sensitive about it? I'm not
sure whether the problem has gone worse but certainly we should be
more aware of the responsibility we have on television to make sure
that older women are part of television as they are of life.
Part of the responsibility of television is to educate and inform
and to entertain. And the BBC, for example, takes that very seriously.
But it forgets also that television is about influencing and everything
that comes from television influences our life and therefore
if there is a dearth of older women on television or in public life
that influences how we think, so if we're removing them, we're
influencing life and what people are looking at all the time and I
think television maybe forgets its strength of influence. And let's
have more older women because they are an important part of our life.
So I'm not sure whether we're more sensitive or not. Jenni, is this a
British obsession, for someone who has lived in America as well?
David and I are the same age and David is more on television, so
maybe it's a fact. Is that right. About what the USA, they have high 
profile women on television? Oki, I think it is a uniquely British
situation. I agree with what has been said about on television, but
I think as women it is a problem about how we feel about ourselves
and how you feel about yourself, what you think is what you become.
I've lived here 20 years and we have an enormous problem with women
feeling that they're past their sell by date. You get a group of
women together our age with no men about and instantly, "I'm old, and
grey, this is falling" and then they're expected to go out into the
world as a vibrant woman. If you don't think of yourself as a
vibrant woman, you're not going to look like that to the world. David,
as the only man, does it bother you when you see really young women
with much older men? I think you do notice. But there is an incredible
irony here. We are an ageing society here and women live longer
than men, so there are more and more older women than there have
ever been and we're having this discussion. Gradually television
should be taken over by older women, just by, if you like becoming the
survivors. Until we value ourselves as continuing vibrant people it is
not going to happen. If television doesn't value older woman, that
influence comes back to women feeling they're not part of the
screen and therefore those conversations are part of
women's...if television were to take the lead. Let her finish.
television have a role that older women having a role show that women
watching will say, "You know what, there's an older woman, I can be
like that." But you have to take responsibility for yourself. If you
want to change perception about who are you are and what you're about,
you have to start with yourself. Well, the fact that cases have been
taken against television and been won by women, the situation is real.
We know this problem. And Julie Walters says she has no roles lined
up. And she's a wonderful actor. isle' give you two perfect English
examples. Helen Mirren and Joanneian Lumley. They're seen
everywhere. And Judi Dench. Exactly. What is the difference between how
they present themselves? But you raised the point in the film, where
were these people when they were younger actors and actresses? I
don't think this has changed. Actually I think the roles for
older actors is growing as we are more interested in it, what did
they think happened before? It's it partially that you do have some
extremely famous people who are finding out exactly what life is
really like. And why are old men considered to have great wisdom and
therefore it's OK for them to stay in front of the public, but we
don't seem to have that image about women so they are dismiss. That's
my point, that women men have this image about themselves, and women
don't. Harriet Harman, thank you for joining us. It was your comment
that sparked this decision. You're claiming that women are written out
of the public dome main bay their lack of being on screen. Can you
explain what you meant by that? think there is a particular form of
discrimination that doesn't apply to older men, who can be described
as having whizz dome    wisdom and are old sages, and that does not
apply to older women. You don't get the best people if you just write
off a section 789 and it sends out a message about older women. And we
have a new generation of older women whose lives have been very
different to that of their mothers, who have gone out to work more and
they don't appreciate being written out of the script and I think it's
straightforward discrimination and TV should deal with it. What is the
solution? The BBC and other broadcasters and even film
companies are talking about equal opportunity of employers. I think
the policies have to be put into action. It is good that we now see
more women on our screens because women's lives have transformed.
Women have really done things they have never done in the past but
this still now, the discrimination is there for older women that
somehow you have to be invisible if you're past your child bearing
years and these older, wise men, with the fresh, younger woman in
the pairing on the TV is what is in. But there are a whole generation of
older women who feel they have a contribution to make and are fit
and healthy and playing a big role in their families, looking after
grandchildren and older relatives as well, and working as well and
volunteering, and they look on TV and they're written out of it.
quotas a way of dealing with it? There are a number of ways. Firstly,
you have to analyse it and measure it and then have to obtaining a
range of ways of dealing with it. But getting rid of fantastic older
women who are on TV. Like Arlene Phillips, getting rid of her on
Strictly was absolutely....and I don't think you should blame the
victim, it's not the older woman's fault it's that their pioneering
role in society and the economy is not being recognised in the 2
century. Thank you very much. I want to bring in a couple of other
contributors. Michael Cole served with the BBC for 30 years before
going into PR. This is about representing the whole nation and a
whole part of society is being left off screen, which is damaging.
casting is vitally important to the success of any television programme
and producers and editors shouldn't have their hands tied by artificial
constraints in any way whatsoever. They should be free to appoint who
they think is right for the programme. Television is a medium
and no one has a right to be on it, and I'm afraid life isn't fair.
Some people look pervert than others. We are all subjective and
given a choice people really prefer to see younger, better looking
people on the screen. And you don't have a problem with that? No, I'm
saying that if you take the case of news problems, male reporters, male
news presenters are in varably, in fact, I can't think of one who is
not, old, seasoned reporters who have many stories under their belt.
The women presenters, I'm afraid this may come as news to you, are
chosen at least in part for their looks and their ability to read the
Autocue and they also wear lovely jackets. And when older women
complain about not having their contracts renewed, I'm afraid
they've had their moment in the sun. It's time to move on and allow
other, younger people to have their chance. I'm sorry to cut you off,
but I want to bring in another contributor. A man who knows a lot
about issue of television. Greg Dyke, a former generally director
of the BBC. You said the BBC was hideously white on screen, now, is
it ageist about women? I didn't say the BBC was hideously white on
screen, I said it was hideously white ie it had very few non white
staff in many, many areas. Sure, OK. On screen? Well, I don't think
there has been talk about older women over a period of time. But as
my generation reaches well into their 60s, it doesn't surprise me
they all start complaining if they haven't got the jobs. I don't
remember them complaining getting the jobs when they were younger and
knocking older people off. This is about people being past their time.
You have to distinct    distinguish the areas between news and drama.
Drama is about acting and writers and it's the writers who are
writing the pieces. And by and large they are going to write about
younger people. I don't think Harriet Harman was right saying
there is a generation of older woman   and I think Mark tampson
said we have to do something about it, I think you've just got to be
careful that the Baby Boomers, when they reach their 60s have want to
hang on to the power they had, and sometimes you have to give way.
David? Nick Ferrari raised the question earlier about seeing
disyapbld people on the front of newspapers, and    disabled people
on the front of newspapers and now we do. We have to reach a situation
where the girl will be older and the man will be decorative. I'm
sure that will come. Just before we started we had a discussion, Jennie,
about how an actor walked into the room and the effect it had. We have
to have decorative guys up there as well as the women. There are women
now who have increasing ly amazing life stories and experiences in
reporting and so on, who you don't want to kick out. Like you didn't
want to kick out Arlene Phillips. Susan? Yes, that is a point.
Television is about how you sound and look but that's very glib. If
we just concentrated on that, the place would be full of people who
have nothing more than a good face or a good sound. We have to move
away from the idea of being decorative. Is it the way forward
that you compart mentalise, and you have Top Greer and Loose Women, and
some women hate Loose Women because it's just carping on about men.
Television reflects society and as long as society. It doesn't reflect
society. No, it reflects what society thinks and as long as
society continues to think that older women are not viable and
attractive that is what we're going to continue to see. There is a new
Director General coming to the BBC. Here is an opportunity for him to
show that the BBC will be sensible and won't follow the social
thing...I Have a programme and you can make it. Done! A couple of
contributions, Rob says "" only women who give up on themselves
have become invisible, just like men." We have to end it there
because the text and on line poll votes are in. We asked is squatting
immoral. 82% of you who voted said yes, it is and 18% said no. David,
you were sympathetic, but people are against it. Yes, given the
demographic of the people who will be watching the programme at this
asked younger people you would have got slightly less of a distinct
distinctive vote. I agree. He did call it, he said 18 to 23. Susan?
It's very difficult to stick a blanket position on squatting and
say it's right or wrong, but when people are asked they will usually
say it is wrong, I'm afraid. And of course, the law has only just come
into force, so we'll have to see how the evictions go. Thank you all
very much indeed. My thanks to everyone who has taken part in the
programme today and all our guests who contributed via webcam or
