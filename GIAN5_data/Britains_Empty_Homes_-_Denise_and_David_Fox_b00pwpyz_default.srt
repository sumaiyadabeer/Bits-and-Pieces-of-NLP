There are millions of homes lying abandoned,
waiting for someone to come and breathe life back into them.
Whether it's a semi or a rambling mansion, we are on the search for Britain's Empty Homes.
Wherever you live in the UK,
the chances are you're not very far from a property
lying empty and unloved.
We're going to show you just how these places could become someone's home again.
Today I am showing a couple of house hunters two vacant houses
that could be the key to their perfect place.
  Wow!
  It gets better and better.
We're meeting the people on a mission to bring dilapidated buildings back into use.
It's falling to pieces.
Empty properties can hold surprising promise for the creative buyer with an eye for a bargain.
Dee and David Fox have sold the house they lived in for the last 22 years in Sutton Coldfield
as their children have flown the nest. Now they have itchy feet.
We see this as an opportunity now
to move away to the countryside to get some peace and quiet.
A bit more fresh air. And get some country living, some country space around us.
David would like outbuildings and space to pursue his hobbies.
My workshop has been a great part of my life at this house,
and I will certainly need to replace that in a new property.
And the prospect of getting their hands dirty doesn't worry them.
I'm not afraid of taking on properties that are derelict or in need of renovation.
We'll give it a go.
Country retreats are highly sought after, but I think an empty house
could be the way to find them the quieter life they crave.
  Are we all set for a bit of house hunting?
  Absolutely. Yes.
What exactly are we looking for, and where do we want it?
In and around Tewkesbury, because it's the ideal location for us both to commute.
Dee would commute north, me south.
After that, we're looking for rural, really rural.
Sort of, half a mile down a private road,
through some woodland, across a drawbridge.
  With a moat.
  And a big kitchen.
I'm not too worried about anything else. I just want a big kitchen.
I'll fit in with anything else.
That's quite flexible.
I am very very flexible. Big kitchen.
  How many bedrooms do we need?
  Minimum two.
  Minimum two.
  We've got two daughters.
My parents. Sister, brother, et cetera, they would want to visit.
So at least one spare room, preferably three, I guess would be ideal.
  It would be ideal.
  It would be good, yeah.
  Or space to build.
  Yeah, OK. How much of this renovation work are you prepared to undertake yourself?
Quite a lot really.
We are quite prepared to knock down, build.
  Renovate.
  Make tea.
  Make tea! That sounds like you're making the tea and you're doing the building.
We are not frightened of a fairly big project at all.
And in terms of outside space, what are we looking for?
  As much as possible.
  Right.
So you would happily fill that, in terms of garden or vegetable patch or workshops, or whatever.
  Yeah, any outbuildings would be a bonus.
  Yeah?
Lots of dreams, how much money have we got to play with? What's the budget?
About £395,000, but that's tops.
The less the better, to be perfectly honest.
Particularly with a property that needs some renovation or some building work,
we're going to have to come back substantially from that to keep within budget.
  Yeah. So, 395 with it all done, finished, ready to go.
  Yeah.
  Right then. Let's see what we can find you.
  Oh, please. Great.
So they want a house with...
..and within rural Gloucestershire.
So it's over to me to find somewhere that ticks all of these boxes
for their budget of £395,000.
Firstly, we're at a house on the outskirts of the medieval town of Tewkesbury.
With a 12th century cathedral, and beautifully preserved architecture,
the town is in an ideal location for both David and Dee
to commute to work.
No one has been living in this house for almost a year.
It's on the market for £350,000,
leaving David and Dee £45,000 from their budget for improvements.
Let's start with this one, shall we?
  There you are.
  It's very interesting.
  Very nice.
  It's technically termed a lodge.
  Oh, right.
I think the giveaway is in these great big pillars.
I suspect it was a gate house or gate lodge to an old estate or farm down there somewhere.
As you can see, open farmland to our left there.
  All in all, however, it comes with 1.2 acres.
  Oh, right, yes.
  It's currently on the market for £350,000.
  Is it?
  Right. Yeah.
  Wow.
The house is sound structurally,
  but I think cosmetically you would want to...
  Put our own mark.
  Shall we have a look?
  Please, yeah.
  Let's go.
Its owners have moved into a nursing home, so it's not been in use for a year.
There are two bedrooms, a reception room and kitchen,
all needing some TLC.
Right, come in, Dee.
  Oh, yes, very interesting.
  As you can see, pretty substantial build.
They are not traditionally huge buildings, lodges.
But this one errs on the side of being quite generous in terms of the space it offers you.
Let's explore, come and have a look. Let's start with this one.
As you can see, reception room.
That fireplace is electric at the moment, but there is a flue there.
  Right.
  So in terms of the open fire...
  We can open that out, yes.
I like the windows, both of them, they're really big.
And it's quite light and airy.
  It's a decent sized room for a lounge.
  It is, yeah.
Right, let's have a look next door in the kitchen.
Follow me through here.
OK, Dee. Is this the big kitchen you were dreaming of?
Well, it's bigger than what I've got at home. But it's not so big.
  No.
  We would need to do something with this.
Absolutely. The point is, you can take all this out.
  You see the back door there?
  Yeah.
I would go through that.
There's a little conservatory/porch arrangement.
  I would wrap a garden room around the back of the property.
  Oh, yeah!
  So you end up with a big L shaped kitchen and living area.
  Yeah.
And I like the view out of the window as well.
That's got real possibilities.
Let's have a quick look upstairs and see what we've got in terms of bedrooms.
See if this place is growing on you.
  Thank you.
Upstairs, there's a bathroom and two bedrooms.
This is the bigger of the two, which I suspect would be the master.
It's a good sized bedroom.
I wonder, if we want an en suite, we could go straight through that wall.
That's where the bathroom is currently, behind there.
Do you think we could find space to fit another small bathroom,
perhaps just a shower, toilet, et cetera, on level two to service the other bedroom?
If you were to give up that built in storage, that would mean
  you could potentially free up that space for next door.
  It's just about big enough as well.
  Right then, garden.
Then it's outside to explore the 1.2 acres of land
and a substantial shed which would satisfy Dave's needs for workspace.
  How about that?
  Oh, yes.
What you get is all of this rough grass right down to that hedge at the bottom.
  It's got lots and lots of potential.
  It's wonderful. You've got a lot of work to do, Dave.
Thank you, thank you!
As there's structural work to do to the house,
we asked a local architect to come round and give us some figures
for knocking the kitchen through into a garden room extension,
putting an en suite in upstairs, and fitting new central heating.
We think that is possible for about £40 45,000.
  Mmm hmm.
  That's interesting. Right.
There's a lot to take in with this place, but has it been worth showing you?
  It's an interesting prospect.
  It is. Yes, it's lovely.
And all the space that we have, it's fabulous.
You've certainly come up with the goods on space.
OK. Well, hold that thought.
  There's plenty more to show you.
  Come on.
Taking on a disused house and making it a home again
it's often hard work, but invariably fantastically worthwhile, regardless of whether it's large or small.
Which is just what Tamsin Western and her partner found out
after buying this railway worker's cottage in Staines,
just outside London, in 2006.
We came to look at the house after visiting several other houses
along this street which were really out of our price range.
Then eventually discovered this one was up for auction.
It had character. Although it was dark and dingy,
you could see it had potential.
When the hammer went down and we knew is was ours, it was,
"Yeah, get in, we've got it, let's get to work!"
It seemed quite daunting at first,
but eventually we could see the progress that was being made which was great.
The house was empty for a year and it took eight months to renovate.
The renovation gave Tamsin a chance to stamp her own distinctive style on her new home.
I'm very keen on '50s styles so it's great to bring something back into a home
and give it a bit of love and even make a feature of it.
Every morning I can't wait to just look at what we've achieved
and just enjoy what we've done. It's home.
Having taken on a vacant house they bought at auction,
they now have a beautiful home,
which cost them 20% less than if it had already been renovated.
We spent about 188,000 on the house, allocated about about 20K for decoration,
and I'd say the house is now worth around 230,000.
We could have never afforded to live in this particular street  
buying at auction was a great way to afford
the kind of house we wanted to live in and do it up as well.
I'd definitely like to do it again.
I've learnt things from this which you could hopefully take to other projects.
If you are worried about an empty property in your street, the chances are you're not alone.
It's quite likely there is already an empty property officer who is on the case.
At Birmingham City Council,
Matthew Smith leads a team handling more than 2,000 cases.
Each month, another 70 new ones land on his desk
in the ongoing struggle to get abandoned buildings lived in again.
Today, Matthew is on his way to a house he's been dealing with for some time.
It's a really, really sad tale, this one.
The owner has been living in the property up until the last two or three months.
He's now been taken into residential care,
and you will see from the look of the property it's as bad as it gets, basically.
With the owner no longer in the house, it's been subject to break ins and vandalism,
resulting in the police calling Matthew in, who now has to make sure the house is secure.
You can see the window frames are as rotten as rotten can be.
Broken glazing up top, curtains... The whole house is falling to pieces.
Matthew is concerned not only for the state of the place,
but the knock on effect it has on the neighbourhood.
Properties like this devalue the neighbourhood.
It's a very sensitive case,
but in reality, it's still lowering the cost of the neighbouring properties
by about 20% of the cost of the property.
The house is open at the back, and although it's in a terrible state,
it does belong to someone, so Matthew needs to stop any further damage occurring.
Property always runs the risk of being set on fire,
anti social behaviour, people breaking in, drug taking,
all sorts of goings on.
It's a shame it's ended up in this condition.
Sadly, the owner may not have been aware that there are people like Matthew
and other agencies who may be able to offer help and support when a home gets too much to cope with.
Matthew has called in a local builder to board up the house and make it secure.
  Someone has been living here up until about four months ago.
  Really?
  I don't expect the back to be any better than the front.
  It's open at the back, shall we look?
Before getting the builders in, they need to check the house is definitely empty.
There's just time for a look around.
Certain there's no one there, the building team board up the house.
Over the coming months, the property will be placed with a solicitor
who will put the property up for sale.
Hopefully, there's a silver lining attached to this case.
The owner is in residential care being looked after.
From the neighbours' point of view, the property will be sold,
and they won't have to live next door to such a problematic property from now on.
If you want to report a place that you think could be abandoned then get on the phone to the council
and make sure your local empty property officer knows about it.
David and Dee Fox have sold their family home in Sutton Coldfield
and are looking for something in rural Gloucestershire.
They have £395,000 to spend.
I reckon a vacant home could be the key to getting them
the countryside lifestyle they crave.
Firstly, I showed them a lodge on the outskirts of Tewkesbury, which,
at 350,000, was well within budget.
  Wow!
  Really something.
Now we head seven miles north west of their ideal location of Tewkesbury to Longdon, in Gloucestershire.
To a 17th century Grade II listed four bedroom cottage.
This former holiday home has lain empty for the past two years waiting for a buyer.
  There.
  Oh, my goodness!
  Wow!
Wow.
  That's beautiful.
  Oooh, dear.
  That is very special.
  Isn't it gorgeous?
  Isn't it?
  It really is.
You're quite right to say it's special.
It's grade II listed.
  About 1640.
  Right.
Loads of history, loads of character.
I kind of figured you were a roses around the door kind of girl, which is what we've got.
Now then...
The really good news is that this is on the market for 299,950.
  You're joking?
  You're joking?
No, it has been presented and priced to sell. It's a real find.
  Oh, my goodness!
  Wow.
  Oh, my goodness.
  It's so pretty.
  Come on. Let's go in.
  Let's get a look!
'Packed with period character, it has a large reception room, kitchen, plus four bedrooms.
'It's strange to think that places like this can lie empty and unrecognised
'until the right buyer comes along and spots their potential.'
This is regarded as a dining area, but you can do anything in this space, really.
  It's so pretty.
  Yeah.
  Come on.
Let's continue.
  Wow!
  Oh, wow, yes.
  Yeah?
  It gets better and better.
  Oh, yeah. It's so big.
  It's glorious.
This is your main living room.
OK? But you've got loads of space.
Whether you go for a separate dining area here, or a cosy sofa arrangement there.
What I love about it is that all the beams have been exposed in their natural state,
  not painted or varnished or anything.
  That's nice.
  That's how they should be.
It's just...a picture book.
It's just what I always dreamt of.
It's just wonderful.
And now it's back to through the dining area and into the kitchen.
Come on in. Now then.
  How does it stack up alongside the rest of the property?
  It's good.
  It's bigger than our kind of kitchen. I like its layout, the windows, the stone tiled floor.
  Yeah.
This works for me as well.
  I hope it works for you.
  It does.
It's big enough.
But there's more,
as off the kitchen is a useful utility area and shower room.
Then it's upstairs where there are four good sized bedrooms.
So how about you in here?
Yeah, very nice.
Given that it's listed, there are issues as to what you can and can't get away with.
My guess, though, is that this wall behind us going into bedroom three
is nothing special.
In which case, if you could negotiate that with the listings guys,
opening this up would give you an enormous master bedroom
that runs the entire width of the property,
giving you this whole end as a kind of master zone if you like.
  I like that.
  It's a very good idea.
And the views from each bedroom, it just goes all around the house.
It's wonderful. It's so exciting.
We have indulged the inside, let's go outside.
Where there's a garage and a nice surprise for Dave.
Behind that big hedge and tree over there,
there is an area off the drive which would easily accommodate
a really nice purpose built workshop. A big workshop.
A really big one.
It's something to think about.
Let's go and explore the garden at the rear. It's very pretty, maybe it's enough. Who knows?
Let's go and have a look.
So there we are. Quarter of an acre. All in.
A lot of the space is soaked up by the planting,
which has kind of got out of control a bit.
What you can't see are the views beyond that, which go out over beautiful farmland.
So there's a lot you can do here. I know you like gardening and it's a big part of what you do.
Because it's grade II listed, there are restrictions as to what can be done with it structurally.
Listing considers architectural and historical interest,
so with any place of this type,
you should consult an architect who is experienced in dealing with such properties
and who can liaise with the local planning authority
to obtain the necessary building consents for any alterations.
So that's what's on offer.
For 299,950.
  Still happy?
  Very happy.
Very, very happy.
We are talking a great saving on our mortgage repayments
on a property that I know a lot of people around the country would die to own.
  It's wonderful.
  It really is.
  You've done well.
  Great potential.
  It's wonderful.
  Brilliant.
Dee and David have seen two houses, both of which tick a lot of boxes for them.
But are they convinced enough to call one of these places home?
We will find out later on.
Back in Britain's second city, Birmingham Council's empty property officer Matthew Smith
is checking up on the progress of a regeneration project
designed to get disused homes back into use.
We are off to a house in the north west part of Birmingham which has been a real problematic property.
I'm meeting a development officer from the council who's going to talk about this scheme
where they have done a couple of properties up in the road, and this is the next to be done.
We're going to see a classic before and after of what the scheme is all about.
This house has been empty for 10 years, and for the past seven years,
Matthew and his team have been trying to get the owner to take action to renovate it.
The reason for the hard hat and the jacket is the house is an absolute tip.
It's falling to pieces, the ceilings are all caved in.
We have to make sure we are fully clothed up for that health and safety sort of thing.
Not nice. Not nice at all.
It's been vandalised, all the fires have been ripped out.
It's pretty much been trashed. Not a pleasant sight at all.
Not fun walking through the house at the moment. A sad tale.
But today Matthew is meeting up with Paul Bartlett
from the council's development team to discuss plans for the house.
  Take us through what it is we're going to do with this one.
  Here we are.
Well, what we are going to do is basically gut it.
All the plaster off the walls, replace all the floors,
new ceilings, a new central heating, solar panels, full rewire.
We are also going to build up into the roof space
and extend slightly out the back, creating four bedrooms.
  Doubling the size of the house.
  With larger homes in short supply,
these extra rooms will be welcome for families in need of a place to live.
The project itself will take about 16 weeks.
  A quick turnaround with a good result at the end.
  I hope so.
  That's the plan.
  Thanks for taking this off my hands.
The council negotiated with the owners the purchase
of four long term empty houses in the same terrace,
and two are near completion, so Matthew's keen to see the end result.
Wow, what a difference!
  What a difference.
  Isn't it just?
We've done this to a very high specification.
I'd be quite happy to have some of this stuff in my house.
To increase its energy efficiency, the house has been fitted with solar panels to power the heating system,
and there's extra insulation and special double glazing.
To think we can achieve that from the house next door which is totally ransacked...
A lot of time, a lot of effort.
For Matthew, it's a very satisfying outcome.
There are a lot of empty properties in the area, so it's ideal when the scheme comes to fruition like this  
turning a horrible house into something...that is ideal.
It smartens up the area and puts a smile on everybody's face.
A perfect end to a story that started many years ago.
Taking a vacant house and giving it new life is often hard work,
but the pay off can be great for both your head and your heart.
Something Carol Fisher knows all too well, having discovered
this 19th century four bedroomed detached house in Surrey in 2006.
The last thing we were looking for was a full renovation project.
I don't think we'd ever, ever looked at something as huge as this.
The building itself really spoke to me because it was unloved.
It was really in a terrible condition and it was pokey and damp smelling.
The house had not been lived in for six months before Carol bought it.
This was a blank canvas, we could do anything we wanted with it.
We'd never be able to find anything that we could afford
in this location, so it's do it yourself or don't do it at all.
Carol's reward for having the nerve to tackle an abandoned building
is creating a home where every detail is bespoke.
And it saved her nearly a quarter of a million pounds on the cost of a newly renovated place.
I think to have bought anything like the four bedroom house we have now
would have cost in the region of £1 million.
Originally, we purchased the house for £460,000.
We spend a total of 300 on the entire renovations.
The folly is our house to live and love and grow with.
But I've certainly got an appetite now for working on other
people's living spaces and bringing some of those ideas to bear for them.
Every time I come home and I walk in the door I think,
"Oh, my God, this is my house!"
No one has what I have, no one ever will.
If you want to make a deserted house your own, here is how to go about finding it.
Let estate agents know exactly what you're looking for and where.
Get them to tell you the moment these gems come on the market.
Be prepared to act because if they are in a desirable area, they can sell fast.
Look around your neighbourhood.
If you spot somewhere and it's on the council's list of empty properties,
they may be willing to approach the owner on your behalf to see if they want to sell.
Today's house hunters Dee and David Fox have been looking for a rural residence
now their children have left home.
They want two or three bedrooms, plenty of land and a workshop for Dave,
all in the beautiful countryside of Gloucestershire.
I've shown them two houses, both comfortably within their £395,000 budget.
But has either inspired them enough to make one of them their next home?
We started with the old lodge, that red brick Victorian number.
  What did you think of that?
  Superb amount of land with it.
  Yeah, 1.2 acres.
  That was good.
The house itself was a very nice house.
It was solidly built with a lot of character.
It needed things doing to it, but those things could make that into something really special.
What about our gorgeous second property?
Grade II listed, 1640, and for a fantastic price.
  I think, Dee, you fell in love with it.
  I did.
I did. I love it. I think it's wonderful.
How about you, sir?
The additional work that we'd want to do, we could do that on our savings et cetera,
so we wouldn't need to borrow a great deal above that.
  Have we inspired you in terms of empty properties?
  Yes.
  Yeah.
I think it's nice to see a property actually empty of furniture rather than a furnished property,
  because you can think about what YOU want to do with it...
  You visualise.
..not have to alter what somebody else has put in place.
  What happens next?
  Those properties have got super potential,
  we need to talk about them.
  Yeah.
Maybe you've come up with a solution for us.
You are playing that very close to your chest.
I hope we have, but either way, I'm glad we have inspired you.
Very best of luck, guys.
Thank you.
Just like any quest, finding your prize can, at times, feel like a pretty elusive business.
But the message is simple   hang on in there, it will all be worth it in the end.
