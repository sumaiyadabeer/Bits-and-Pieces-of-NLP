Coming up on today's Blue Peter...
Anything could happen, Dick and Dom are here in the studio
to give you the inside story on their brand new show.
Ed Petrie digs deep into how you can improve your drawing.
'And cooking doesn't get tougher than this.
'I go head to head with CBBC chef Aaron Craze
'to discover how to create an eco friendly feast.'
How do you know when a tomato's roasted?
Barney Rubble, you're in trouble.
Hi. Hello. Thanks very much. How you doing?
Welcome to Blue Peter. It's a live show.
As you can see, Helen isn't here,
  so I'm sailing this good ship on my lonesome.
  Aw!
But while she's away, the boys will play.
It's an extreme show today. We've extreme cooking,
we've got the extreme...ly naughty Dick and Dom.
They're here to talk about their new show Diddy Movies.
They're in the dressing room getting ready...
I'm sorry, I've got a bit of interference there.
Hello. I'm Diddy Barney. Who are you? Diddy Baxter?
  No! I am Diddy Helen Skelton.
  Oh, right.
And, recently, I've been to the South Pole.
  Really? Have you?
  Yeah!
I had to poo in a bag and wait for it to freeze,
  then I stuck it in my back pocket!
  Oh, right.
You know what? Smells like it's starting to thaw out.
  Do you want to have a look?
  Yeah.
  Look.
  It's definitely thawing out.
  It smells like lemons, dear.
  Oh.
  Aw, stinks.
I have never seen our producer looking as nervous.
Dick and Dom are live in the studio.
If you'd like to ask them a question, you can. It's live.
This is happening right now.
We'd like you to you ask them any question you like.
The crazier, the zanier, the better.
Only e mail if you're watching this on Thursday.
We like to give you the inside story here,
and we know you love to draw. How cool would it be to draw
for the most amazing stories around the country?
Well, we found out that Ed Petrie, CBBC presenter all over the place,
also happens to be a bit of a cartoonist in his spare time,
so we sent him along to get top tips from the expert.
I love reading. And I love drawing even more.
If you ask me, some of the best books are made better
by the illustrations inside them.
I've brought a pad, a pen and a short story I've written
to get some tips from a top children's illustrator.
'This is Corky Paul.
'He's been illustrating children's books for over 35 years.
'In that time, he's drawn everything there is to draw,
'including witches, dragons and pirates.'
He's really good.
'He's here to give the children tips on how to draw their own characters.
'I've tagged along to see
'if I can get advice for illustrating my short story.'
Let's see, who shall we draw a dinosaur portrait of?
Ed!
Come on up, Ed.
Don't make my nose look too big.
'By exaggerating my features, he can turn me into a comedy dinosaur.'
  I was captain of the cross country team.
  Ooh, there you go!
My feet aren't that big!
A bit of yellow in there. A bit of grass.
  Look at that!
I've just about forgiven you for turning me into an ugly dinosaur.
  I think you look handsome.
  I think that's open to debate.
  I wonder if you could help me illustrate this story.
  Yeah.
It's about a handsome and talented TV presenter called Ned Feetree.
It's not based on anyone in reality!
He's training a snail for the Olympics.
He takes him to Paris to show him how much he believes in him.
He doesn't realise snails are a delicacy in France.
And he gets chased down a road at six miles an hour
and becomes the fastest snail in the world.
  Where do you start?
  Well...
In a picture book, you have to have your text and pictures work together.
My first thing, I would think, I have to draw a picture of Ned here.
  Let's see, what will he look like?
  A very handsome guy.
Very handsome. Let us see now.
Do I do handsome guys? Yeah, I can do handsome.
There are so many things you need to be an illustrator.
What's the most important?
The most important is using your imagination.
I mean, lots of people can draw,
but it's being able to create your own vision of the world.
He's looking glum. He's poor.
He keeps spending on training this snail.
Exactly. He can't afford haircuts. You work out the character.
This is what I love in illustration,
when your eye's drawn to something that wasn't in the story.
  The other character, the snail.
  Oh, yes!
  Harold the snail.
  So you think about a snail.
I'd usually go and see what snails look like,
because there are snails with incredible patterns.
Every time you draw a scene,
think of how you can draw it in an unusual way, rather than front on.
We've a kid looking up at something. You want to have the kid's view.
  Don't do the most obvious thing.
  Absolutely!
I think that's good already.
I use a pen and some ink,
and maybe we'll improve the drawing a bit here.
'Some of the tips are surprising,
'he's given me loads of ideas for my own drawings.'
The ink is still wet and that's a nice effect you get.
Are you doing that on purpose? Yeah, yeah.
When you try to make a negative into a positive,
rather than trying to hide it.
You can make a big old mess and say, "I meant to do that."
Can't believe the speed you work at, these are great.
You know, when you have a deadline to meet.
  I was hoping I could take them away for inspiration.
  Please do.
I'll try and illustrate my own story myself.
Read the text and draw and try and add something to the text.
  I'll try and do it justice.
  Thanks so much. Great. Bye bye.
'The characters have inspired me to finish illustrating my story.
'For the full version of Ned Feetree and the Incredible Olympic Snail,
'complete with my illustrations, head to the Blue Peter website.'
And that address is...
Check out Ed Petrie's quite fantastic illustrations.
Look at these. You should recognise these as book tokens.
You'll have been given them as part of World Book Day. If you have some,
you need to spend them before the end of this month.
So go and get yourself some great stories. Still to come...
Dick and Dom will be here talking about their new show
and they have a Blue Peter challenge to complete.
You won't want to miss it.
Now, this week is Climate Week,
which means we're raising awareness for environmental issues.
Did you know the food we eat can sometimes be harmful for the planet?
Before the food hits the shelves, there's a process.
It's been packaged and transported, sometimes a long way.
This can create gases like carbon dioxide,
which are harmful for the planet.
So, is it possible to create an environmentally friendly meal
that's good for taste buds and the planet?
Myself and Aaron Craze were set a Blue Peter challenge to find out
and it all happened in this telly.
It's a culinary clash never before seen on UK television.
Blue Peter presenter and very amateur cook Barney Harwood
is going head to head against Aaron Craze,
host of Junior Bake Off and a very good chef indeed.
Their mission   to create the tastiest meal they can
that uses the lowest carbon.
  Barney Rubble, you're in trouble.
  I'm feeling quite confident.
They'll have just 30 minutes to impress two expert judges.
Cooking doesn't get more environmentally friendly than this.
Before we can let the rivals into the kitchen,
they need to source the ingredients for their final plate of food.
First to take to the supermarket aisles is underdog Barney Harwood.
He knows exactly what's on his menu.
I'm going for fish, chips and mushy peas. It has to be low in carbon.
Potatoes come out of the ground and fish comes out the sea
and peas grow on pea trees!
So the most low carbon meal you've heard of. Let's get the ingredients.
These are British white potatoes,
it says "good for everything", so good for my dish and the planet.
The most carbon efficient veg are those grown in season on home soil.
They have the least far to travel, meaning less fuel is burned.
So British spuds are a good choice, Barney.
But as it happens, not all veg are good for the climate.
At certain times of the year, some more exotic veg can't grow in the UK.
This means they have to be flown over from other countries
to get them on to our supermarket shelves while they're still fresh.
Since planes create carbon dioxide, it's not good for the environment.
Meanwhile, opponent and top chef Aaron Craze has decided on his menu.
I am going to do a lovely stir fry. First I will need chicken.
I have come to this aisle where you have mini fillets
and they're perfect. I don't think it's going to travel too far.
Can't get more British than that flag.
No meat is carbon free, because rearing animals uses energy,
but at least Aaron's chosen chicken instead of beef or lamb.
They're both higher in carbon for a reason you might not expect.
When cows and sheep burp, they give off methane,
which is involved in global warming.
Some people say, if we ate less beef and lamb,
there'd be less damage to the environment.
This extreme low carbon challenge
isn't as straightforward as our chefs first thought.
Barney's chosen to cook traditional fish and chips
in the hope that local ingredients equal planet friendly.
And Aaron has gone oriental with a chicken stir fry,
since he showed British chicken has a low carbon footprint.
Because I'm making my own batter, I need lots of milk.
That's got to be low carbon, cos it comes out of a cow!
How much carbon can you use just doing that?
But, Barney, cows do equal methane.
Six large British eggs, in one piece. Beautiful.
It's a small mistake for Aaron.
These British eggs haven't travelled far, but they've minimal packaging.
Although foods with excess packaging are worse for the environment.
Will Harwood make the same mistake with his home made ketchup?
The process of making packets probably uses more energy
so that might mean things in packets are less carbon efficient.
So let's go without packets.
Always thinking.
Well done, Barney, they are British and low in packaging,
but this low carbon game isn't as easy as it might seem.
It's not tomato season, so, to get them in March,
they have to be grown under hot lamps and that burns energy.
Supermarket shopping over,
both contenders have avoided processed foods,
so there's everything still to play for,
but what has Aaron chosen for his final ingredient?
I've found the best kept secret in London.
Right in the middle of the city on top of an organic supermarket.
An urban roof garden.
You don't get lower carbon than this. Growing veg locally in season means
you can pick them fresh
and they haven't travelled any distance at all.
I have nice kale. These are really early, so they're tender.
They might be nice just tossed in the stir fry. A couple of these!
With super fresh veg like that, Aaron could have the edge.
But wait a minute, what's Harwood up to now?
I'm at an East London fish market.
This is the largest selection of fish you'll find in the country.
All I need to do is find a nice tasty fish I can put a batter on.
So long as you choose carefully.
Fish are lower carbon since they don't burp methane,
but some are being over harvested.
Whiting's more environmentally friendly. There's lots of whiting.
Better still, whiting can be caught close to home in the North Sea,
so top marks for another low carbon choice.
  Beautiful.
  It is, you're bang on, Barney!
Hold up a minute, I've got a big one here.
  You sold it so well, I'll go for the whiting.
  Good man.
  Brilliant.
I can't get it out.
Oh. Oh!
  Bon appetite.
  Thank you very much.
  Cheers, mate.
  Bye bye.
I'm sure I've got the lowest carbon environmentally friendly fish.
Apparently, they're really tasty. All I have to do is cook them.
I am over the moon with this box of treasures.
There's so much to play with and it'll be fantastic for my stir fry.
Barney, you've a lot of work to do, mate.
Still to come...
It's egg whisks at dawn as the competition hots up.
Who will be crowned the low carbon king of the kitchen?
Stay tuned to find out.
A dramatic voice over from Helen Skelton. I know who wins, of course,
cos I was there, but you'll have to stay tuned.
Now, two people who are full of surprises.
Welcome to the studio Dick and Dom!
  Hello.
  Good to see you.
  Boo!
Mind out, dear. Mind out.
  How you doing?
  How are you, mate?
  I'm good.
  No time for that!
  We normally kiss.
Let's talk about why you're here.
  You have a new show. We normally see you as the Diddys.
  Yeah.
But you've taken it to a new level.
You're used to seeing the Diddy Dick and Dom in a pink cupboard.
Now, eventually, Diddy Dick and Dom have come out of their pink cupboard
and are Hollywood movie stars.
  They are!
  Do they get the perks of the movie stars?
  The girl friends, the house?
  Not any of that.
I have a little friend here. I don't need any more of that.
We re enact different movies, we do a musical, a space film,
a murder mystery film. We do the lot. It's brilliant.
So what happens, Diddy Dick and Dom on each episode turn up in tuxedos
and go and watch the premier of their brand new movie.
We can show you a great clip. Have a look.
Remember, your nearest emergency exit may be inside you.
In the event of us getting bored, sponge cakes will descend from above.
And remember, to never ever press this button.
Argh!
Oh, no. It's a total disaster!
  Please, no more.
  The legends.
It looks like so much fun to film.
  It was.
  Ted Robbins is involved.
Ted is the Governor from The Slammer.
He becomes our agent. He gives us the money to fund the films.
It was a good experience and we did it a different way.
  We used to do it our heads with little puppet bodies.
  As you saw.
But this way, now what we do is have our bodies
but they super impose our heads so we look huge.
  We had to wear hot suits.
  Vis effects!
So special effects, which all movies have, and a great theme tune.
We do. In homage to the best CBBC programme there is, Barney.
  Shall we watch it?
  Yeah.
Pull the main line. Tie the rig in.
Make me a blancmange!
Woo hoo!
What a lovely re enactment it was.
  Especially for you.
  Those are the actual words for the theme tune.
This makes you experts at all things Diddy.
It's sometimes hard when you look at the TV
or watch movie stars to tell how tall they are.
It's a trick of the camera. We've devised a game to see
if you can tell all things diddy from all things biggie.
  We love a game.
  Yes!
  In that case, it's time to play Who's The Diddy?
  Follow me.
  Oh, nice music.
As you can see, on the board here, we've six celebrity faces. Stop it.
Honestly.
We have Robin Williams from Night At The Museum.
We've Dominic Wood from Dick and Dom.
Reece Witherspoon from Monsters Vs Aliens.
David Hasselhoff, The Hoff. The only guy who can in slow motion.
  We have Richard McCourt.
  Is that really me?
  It is, about ten years ago.
  I've got the jowls now.
And we have Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible.
Behind you, there are some bodies with heights on.
We'd like you to match the celebrity face with the body.
You'll have 45 seconds to do it and your time starts now. Go!
I know I'm very small. Not that small! So...
Second to last.
  You're 5'5"?
  Shut up!
  You're smaller than that.
Shut up! In Cocktail!
Tom Cruise. He's quite small. Little man.
30 seconds!
She's lovely.
Come on, take her!
You think she's tall? About that!
  How tall are you?
  I'm a big one.
What about The Hoff?
Oh, yes, he's nearly as tall as me.
  15 seconds left.
  Nanoo nanoo! Ask your dad!
We've done it before time.
That's the end of the game.
I was about to fill five seconds in a professional mode.
  Who needs to? It's all over.
Here we have Tom Cruise, who you thought was 5'2".
That should have been Reece Witherspoon.
Here we have Dominic, you thought you were 5'5".
  I know I am.
  You are 5'5".
You thought Reese Witherspoon was 5'7".
Tom Cruise is 5'7". Robin Williams is 5'8"?
Yes, he is. Well done!
David Hasselhoff, 5'9"?
  No! You're 5'9".
  I'm 5'9"?
Richard McCourt, 6'4"?, No, he's not. David Hasselhoff is.
You've got one, two, three, just two right.
  Which isn't bad.
  For the record, I blame him.
  That means
  you can answer questions later.
  Good!
  In the meantime, let's see
who wins the eco food challenge, myself or the professional chef.
You'll be surprised.
Previously in our culinary clash,
these two eco warriors prepared for their kitchen battle.
Barney's chosen to cook fish and chips with peas and ketchup
and Aaron has planned a chicken stir fry
with super fresh veg and noodles from scratch.
Now it's time for them
to conjure up their eco meals for two of the toughest judges in town.
Ten year old Freya was winner of last year's Junior Bake Off,
but this time, it's her turn to do the tasting.
What I'm looking for is a clean worktop and great output.
Joining her to judge will be Mike, an expert in eco friendly eating.
He never fails to spot a high carbon food.
I'll be looking for seasonal vegetables,
not too much red meat and not too much packaging.
They'll look for the most eco friendly meal our chefs can make.
You have 30 minutes to whip up the dish of your choice.
Your time starts now.
I'm feeling confident. I think everyone loves fish and chips.
There's your key word. Fish.
I reckon that's as low carbon as it gets.
Mine is pretty much carbon free.
British chicken. A boxful of herbs. Hello!
Chop chop, boys! Less talking more cooking.
First up for Barney is the ketchup.
I'm going to roast these for extra flavour. Look at me go!
Aaron is making his noodle dough. It's made from flour, eggs and salt.
Give it a good old fold and squash it back through the machine,
until it's like leather.
They'll roast for about 20 minutes.
I want it nice and thin. Here we go.
Go down one step at a time.
Mamma mia!
With his ketchup underway, Barney adds mint and butter
to his peas as he prepares to pulp them.
Time to mush them with my whizzy musher.
Oh, yeah.
As Aaron preps the veg and chicken, he seems confident of a win.
Barney Rubble, you're in trouble.
  How do you know when a tomato's roasted?
  Dunno!
Our chefs are making good progress, but what do the judges think?
I quite like the idea of the stir fry with the chilli,
but then again, the fish and chips sounds good.
Do you think the ingredients are very eco friendly?
I am worried about the amount of chicken Aaron has put in
and about Barney's unseasonal tomatoes.
  Barney...
  Oh!
  ..you only have five minutes left.
  Five minutes?
As in half of ten minutes, as in three minutes more than two?
  You better crack on with it.
  I will.
Tomato sauce is pretty much done.
That's it. Have I forgotten anything?
Your fish, Barney.
You only have one minute left until your plates are on.
One minute? What you doing to us, Freya?
While Aaron is nearly finished...
  A bit of juice going.
  Now for the fish.
..it looks like Barney could be in for a battering.
Fantastic. That's nearly done.
That is ready.
Here we go. Fish is ready.
Time's up, guys, stop cooking now.
Oh, dear.
'Come on, Barney!'
It's done. Beautiful.
'It's a good job this isn't being judged on presentation.'
Voila! Fish and chips!
'So Barney has made a low carbon fish and chips with home made ketchup
'and mushy peas which looks surprisingly professional.
'And Aaron has plated up a stir fry with noodles made from scratch.
'He's used the freshest veg in town.
'But whose dish is the best for the planet and the taste buds?'
Lovely low carbon seasonal veg.
Pasta is made very nicely.
That's another fine low carbon food.
I think I done well and, um, I'm confident I am going to win.
And this is a local sea fish?
  According to the guy at the market.
  Fantastic.
  I thought that was good.
  Great carbon credentials. Well done.
  Chips are nice and fluffy.
  Aren't they?
I like to think I could win.
I'm up against a professional chef who's better looking than I am.
'Tasting over, it's time to deliberate.'
Let's talk about taste.
Although Barney's fish was crumbly,
I loved the batter. It was very crispy.
I thought Barney's fish was a really good low carbon choice,
but I'm a bit more bothered about his unseasonal tomatoes.
I thought Aaron's was very nice and I loved the kick of chilli.
He could have done better on the chicken.
He could have done a vegetable stir fry instead.
Two great dishes, but we can only pick one.
  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
  I think I might be.
'So with the decision made,
'it's time for our judges to announce the overall winner.'
OK, guys, we have come to a decision.
Our eco champion is...
  ..Aaron.
  Yey!
'The judges decided that Aaron's stir fry was the tastiest,
'and, in spite of the chicken, his low carbon rooftop veg
'and noodles made it the lowest carbon meal.'
  Well done.
  Nice one, mate.
  Good game.
Mum, it's me, I won it! Yeah, I won it. I know. I know. He's here.
He's all right. Not crying.
I have to say, the best man won. His food was amazing.
I want to get through the e mails,
  we have had the most amount of e mails all guests.
  Rubbish!
Eleanor says, if you could have a superpower what would it be and why?
  The power to double our wages.
  Yeah.
  That would be nice.
  Amy says, what's the weirdest thing you've eaten?
  His food.
  His vegetarian food.
  Charming.
Shale says, who is the funniest?
  He is.
  Ben says, how are you so funny?
  Er, we have a good producer who tells us what to say.
  Yes.
  Chelsea says, do you still play bogies?
  No, we hate it.
  Lot's of people play it to us. We don't hate it!
  We love it!
  That's what I meant.
  Remember that restaurant?
  Yes.
  That was funny.
Somebody started playing bogies in a posh restaurant.
  How long you known each other for?
  Since 1997.
  Yes, many years.
  How did you start as a presenter?
  I started making the tea.
  As a runner.
  I started presenting my live Friday afternoon show.
Since then, every presenter has been
  straightening their hair, which you started?
  Sorry? Can't hear you(!)
  Dick and Dom, legends.
  Thank you!
Let's talk about next week's show. We have a Harry Potter special.
Not only will we be on the set, we will show you round,
doing the tour and you'll see the special effects.
And, you love them, JLS will perform on the show.
If you want to ask them questions, go to the message board
get your questions in and we'll try to ask as many as we can,
cos so many of you have got in touch.
  Dick and Dom, thank you very much.
  Diddy movies!
  Monday. CBBC. 3:35!
Don't forget, this Friday at 8:30pm, you can catch up
with Helen's Polar Challenge for Sport Relief. She's incredible.
Have a lovely week.
Bye.
