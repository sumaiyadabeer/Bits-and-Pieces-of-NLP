tonight. We have got glorious natives and exotic visitors.

I know it is bar chart. I know the difference between the You just
live for statistics, of all the people. I know the difference
between them. Hell a welcome to Springwatch, coming from Pensthorpe
here in north Norfolk. The programme is live, as such I can
give awe live weather forecast, it is grey and damp. It has been damp
all day, we have had a very dynamic day. Yesterday we introduced you to
a new bird this year, the little ringed plover, take a look at this.
come back, I predicted it would, I won't give a clue, but I'm looking
rather smug. Last week we hoped to bring you views of a really lovely
little bird, that hasn't been seen on Springwatch since 2005. Have we
managed to do that, of course we have. Here she is, a spotted
flycatcher, and you will be meeting her and her lovely little lunch of
very new chicks, a little bit later in the programme. First we go to
Dorset to Simon King. Thank you very much, welcome to
rather breezy hill overlooking the beach, the lagoon known as The
Fleet. This end of it Abbottsbury swanry. You will know we have been
concentrating on one swan family among the 130 or so pairs that nest
family with five chicks, cignit that is will only be in the nest
the water to feed. We have breaking news p the swan family, which we
greet, it has to be said with mixed emotion. During the programme we
will be looking at the wildlife of Dorset's woodlands, including the
roe deer family, and a truly wild mystery.
Let's kick off with the most dramatic events of the day, with
those little ring plovers, for those of you who weren't watching
yesterday, this is what we saw. The plovers, at some point, became
tremenduously agitated, this is what happened, a jackdaw had
arrived on the scene, it stole up to the nest, and despite their best
efforts it pinched one of the eggs, took it off and ate it. Jackdaws,
are amongst the cleverest of all birds, and they will continually
return to a site of food. They have take be the trouble to find it,
they have proved it was productive, they won't forget about it. I
imagined the jackdaw would, in fact, come back to the nest. Sadly,
Chris's imagination proved absolutely right. This is what
absolutely right. This is what happened, first thing this morning.
The jackdaw was back, watch how the little ring plover adults react.
This behaviour is extraordinary, they are acting as if they are
injured to distract the jackdaw. They are pretending to be disabled,
they are trying to get the jackdaw to go for them insteads, and on a
couple of occasions it starts to do that. Both adults, French ethically
giving the broken wing display, but the jackdaw is in intent on giving
this. I don't understand why they won't go and sit on the eggs.
but he goes and takes the egg. They are a more powerful bird, it would
just give them a good pecking, the only hope is they think it be a
lured away. You can see it is eating the remains of a chick in
the egg, which means they are just off hatching. But that could be a
good thing, because she has still got two eggs, or certainly did,
just as we went on air. Let's go to her live now. You can see she's
sitting tight on her two remaining eggs. What I was wondering, if they
hatch in the next 24 hours, and it looks close, are the chicks safer
from the jackdaws or the eggs, or just as vulnerable. That will be
the best thing, if they hatch they will lead the young away, almost
immediately. The young are very well camouflaged and have a great
response to predators, the adults give a call, that warns them, the
young birds will crouch down, nuzling underneath the vegetation,
they are incredibly difficult to see. Because they have dispersed
from the area where the jackdaw knows there is food they are a
better chance of surviving. It is fingers crossed the jackdaw doesn't
come back until they have hatched, it could be one or two days. One to
keep your eye on overthe weekend on the webcams. Let's bring you an
update of the avocet family that has been charming us. Four chicks,
can you count the legs. Here is the adult, they are being brooded,
there were all four under there. One has come out here, beautiful
little things, did you see the bill, it is deaf you infinitely curve up.
All four of them doing really well. They are OK. At the moment they are
spending, about 67% of their time being brooded or looked after by
the parents, and about 20% of their time out feeding, that is one they
are vulnerable. They are not safe yet. 20% of the time, there is
kestrals, jackdaws and crows, that will be after those cute avocets.
The parents taking great care. That is rather lovely, fishing, you can
see it kicking up the dirt at the bottom of the scrape. Right in deep
here, it has gone in, and it means it can feed on food that the other
birds, which haven't such long legs, can't normally reach. It is using
the full extent of its ability to access a place. It looks like it
might have seen something. missed. We don't have to worry
about this eating those avocet chick, but if that were was a heron.
They are voracious. They will eat anything, water voles, grass snakes
and young birds. Let's go back to Dorset and see
what Simon's news is about the swan family. Thank you very much,
welcome back to the hill. Extraordinary scenes those on the
scrape, amazing stuff, what an insight into the creatures. We are
getting an astonishing privilege in Dorset, looking at a swan family,
if you watched yesterday's show you will know. Let's have a look at the
events over the last 36 hours. This was seven eggs on the nest, six
hatch, one of those six chicks died within a few hours of hatching, it
was weak and didn't manage to get further. The remaining five looked
rather healthy, fit and well. They did start to venture down to the
warter's edge, you would expect that, the fittest amongst them. Not
so much to feed, they are still surviving on the proteins from the
egg yolk that remains within their body, but to drink and become
familiar with their watery environment. They look like sponges,
they absorb the water and sink, they have water proofing and they
are light and buoyant. Mum and dad standing close guard over the
family, they need to, they are vulnerable at this stage. They are
small and weak. Those sorts of forays were short
lived, itsn't long before they made their way back on to the nest
platform to gather with side their mother    beside their mother and
gather up close for the security of the night in her wing. We arrived
this morning, the camera team arrived early expecting to find all
five chicks healthy and well, I'm sorry to say that wasn't the case,
this is what greeted the camera team. Count them, just three. If
you look at the one at the back, it does have a slightly damaged eye,
we can only begin to speculate, we can't be sure what's happened. It
does look at some point, maybe early in the morning, they ventured
on to the water and perhaps had a fracas or dispute with neighbouring
swans. We got to look into the nest, there is the egg that didn't hatch
and the body of the one chick that died in the nest, so sign of any
other carcasses. That makes me believe that there was some kind of
dispute, as I say. If you look at the face of this chick, there is a
line running under the eye, as though it has been grabbed by the
beak of a swan. Impossible to be sure. I would like to think the two
separated by the family are young enough to have been adopted by a
neighbouring family. That does happen. We can't be sure, because
this are so many different swan families this the one place. We
can't be certain just what has happened to them. We are keeping a
close eye on the family, we have live cameras down there now, on the
fleet and nst.    nest. You wouldn't think there
were those sorts of life and death dramas. This is this sense of peace
and calm watching swans. It is a cliche to say whilst the
swan is drifting on top a great deal is going underthe surface.
That one has its leg out, it is thermoregulating, keeping warm by
putting its leg into the warmer air. Let's look what is happening in the
nest as we speak. We have a lovely view of the female, she's known as
the pen, any view of the chick under her wing, or chicks. All
three of them, I believe are still there. I'm surprised to see them
still on the nest at this stage. I would have thought they would have
ventured further away. She may be staying on the nest longer than
usual, because she still has that unhatched egg, it is unlikely to
hatch, she is still sticking to the nest, she will have to move soon,
that is for sure. If she doesn't those chicks are get terribly
hungry, they won't get fed any other way. They have to get on to
the water. I will bring you more news about the swan family and
other wildlife later in the programme.
Kate, I'm going to do something uncharacteristic. I'm going to be
really unPC. I'm going to be ageist, I'm going to suggest that the bird
we are going to speak about next will probably only be well known to
people over 50 years old. People a little bit older than me but only a
year. In the space of that time, this bird has become very rare, in
fact it has declined by 50%, I'm talking, of course, about the
spotted flycatcher, it is a charming little bird, people really
like them, they have a habit of returning to the same nesting place
year after year, they very frequently nest on people's porches
and windowsills, they are close to people and confiding and
trustingment our birds this year are nesting on the side of the tree
here. They feed on insects, and they have a wonderful habit of
choosing a familiar perch, normally in the sunshine, and they watch for
flying insects, fly up and grab the insect, a fly or bee species, they
fly off or eat it in the nst, and they fly back to the same perch.
had them on a farm in Devon, they would sit on the fence of the
cattle enclosure and fly up, catch a fly come back down and repeat
that endlessly. This separates them from other species, that might take
the insects off the ground and glean them off the tree. They are
taking them out of the air, the only thing they are competing with
are swallows and Martins. They take them in an enclosed area, and not
from the field. They have a niche when it comes to foraging.
Let's meet live our spotted flycatcher family. Brilliant timing,
there is the adult, you can see how young the chicks are, thee had four
chicks. Last    she had four chicks, last night the fifth one hatched.
Let's revel, a bit of brooding. Isn't that gorgeous. The chicks are
naked, it is important she keeps them warm. They have lovely little
crest which they erect when they get really excited. You see it so
well in that picture is how beautifully camouflaged she is
against the knots of the wood and the twists of the ivy there.
nest can be really difficult to spot, lined with moss and feathers
and fine grasses, sometimes some hair. She is are sub Saharan
migrants, they have gone south of the Sahara for winter. Let's show
you the moment we caught on camera last night, when you can see very
tiny chicks, and look at the bottom there, there's an egg that hasn't
hatch, and look at her, she is removing an egg shell, that is the
final chick hatching last night. This is somewhere between 13 and 15
days at that, it is the female that does all the incubation. They are
bringing in all the food, regurgitating the insects, the
female passing it over straight away. Their eyes are still closed,
they are responding to noise. If anything flies over the nest, the
heads go up, hoping it is the parents who brought them something
to eat. Another family keeping us entranceed is the kestrals, this is
them live. These chicks are literally growing before our eyes,
they are getting bigger and bigger. They are all in the huddle, staying
warm. The unhatched egg is in the foreground, kicked out of the area.
They have been more mobile with the warm day. You can just about see
some feathers, just coming through that sort of very thick grey down
that of this got here. Our story developers who have been looking at
these bird from 4.00am to midnight, have been diligently recording what
they are eating, first thing this morning, 4.30am, the female brings
in a frog. I wouldn't want to cope with a frog at 4.30am. Look at this
the male is going down here, when he flies up, you can see trailing
from his legs an earthworm. That was unusual, because you didn't
have that classic kestral hover, he went straight down. Conserving
energy, the reward is only a worm and not a vole. Voles are still
being brought in, they form the basis of much of the diet. They are
bringing in birds too, chaffinch, Robin. Our story developers are so
diligent, I have been able to create a bar chart.
I'm glad you called it that. Stay close to me, I have the useful
untensil here. Here on Saturday they were catching a lot of small
mammals, as we progress through to Tuesday the number of small mammals
goes down, because it was wet. Yellow is earthworms, on Tuesday
the incidence of earthworms has gone right up, taking advantage of
the worms on the surface there. Today we have the appearance here
of the frog and the birds have dropped off completely. This worm
appearance here could be a short  term effect if it doesn't stay wet.
We will follow the course of this, I will be producing a whole series
of graphs, pie diagrams and other statistical devices so you can
enjoy the diet of kestrals. Another thing they have been doing is this,
watch the chicks at the back, it looks like a scene from alien. It
is producing a pellet. I didn't think the chicks could do it.
they are fed when they are very small, the adults tear the food
into such small pieces it can pass through their gut, the adults then
start to give them bigger things with great chunks down, they have
to regurgitate the solid bits. Now we are on the subjects of pellets,
I have been on my travels with my Let's all think about bird poo,
although I have to say, it's the difficult one. But before we start,
I want to make a clear separation between bird poo and bird pellets.
Pellets, like this one here, are the indigestable parts of the
things that the birds have been eating that have been separated in
their prestomach and regurgitated through the mouth. This is a barn
owl pellet, if we were to look inside we would find the fur and
bones of the mammals they have been eating. It is not just bird of prey,
blackbirds in your garden, they will cough up packages of soil they
have separated from the earthworm's they have been eating. What about
pellets and poo. There is a difference between mammals and bird
poo. The waste products that come from the faeces and urine are
discharged in separate exits in mammals, but birds they come out of
the same hole, the white stuff is the urine and the dark stuff is
faeces. There are three types of bird poo, they come in liquid form,
produced by birds of prey, cormorants, then you get semi 
liquid poo, perhaps like the faecal sacs, then you get firm, sin lind
kal poo, trying to preserve the first two types is very difficult,
I have tried and failed. Here is some game bird poo, from my private
collection. This is red grouse, I saw this being produced in Scotland
by some of the grouse themselves. Down the bottom, from higher up the
mountain, this is tarmagon poo, unlike the bird, it doesn't turn
white in the winter time. Here is some caper cale poo, you can even
see the pine shoots the birds have been eating, there you go, it is
over to you. Remember that the clue is in the poo! I have a piece of my
all time favourite bird poo, it is Greenwood pecker would. It looks
like a rolled cigarette. But if I crush it, you can see the remnants
of all the many hundreds of ants they have eaten. My biology teacher
showed me this in 1973, and it has never stopped giving me enjoyment.
Stay tuned for his second favourite poo, first live to rivercalm. It is
just on the bridge under Neath us. Nothing on it now, but it has been
an    underneath us, but now, it is very much been active. A goose is
disturbed, you can see the head of an otter, which immediately begins
to porpoise, to look and see where the goose is gone. I have no doubt
it had its hungry eyes on the goose. Would it take a full size goose
like this? It would have a go, they seem to be very brazen. But they
are, unfortunately, giving our dedicated cameraman, Andrea Yates,
the slip. If you were watch    Markyateate, the slip. If you were
   Mark Yates. He has been trying to bring you really great shots of
otters, he did the same after the show, he set up the hide until
1.00am. He gave up and went home. I'm not going to be able to do this,
because I know what he's doing. He went home and gave himself a little
lie in. While he was lying in, something extraordinary happened at
11.00 this morning, which he missed, but rivercamdidn't.
These were the scenes that Mark managed to sleep through. But
luckily, Joe, he was controlling rivercam. A far more sober
gentleman! This is stagering, it is right by the bridge, where Chris
and I are standing now, the otter is, as you can see, it is
constantly diving down, finding food. The thing is there were
people standing on the bridge, this was all happening a few metres away
from them, if you watch the otter, it gets to the point where it spots
the people and then starts posing, and they were taking photographs of
it. Look at that, what an opportunity. That little leaf is
pretty annoying. If you took the photograph you will have to take it
out. I think these otters are just leading you a merry dance. I'm sure
he will be back here this weekend. We will bring you any more otter
action we get over the weekend next week. We have been getting some
unprecedented views of some of the very fine fresh water fish that
live in our rivers, curtesy of legendary cameraman Hugh Miles. He
has become a passionate exponent of the charms of British rivers, and
the wildlife that they support, but he's also deeply worried about them.
There is lots of problems, one of which, there is too many people,
and we waste too much water. Less flow means less weed growth,less
insects, less food for birds and less food for fish. This is a
problem for every river in the country. A widespread issue.
thought there was a tremendous amount of work on rivers, that
things like all the agricultural pollutants, that caused so many
problems in the 1960s were banned, and rivers are in a good state now?
There is a lot of defuse pollution still, we have lost 95% of our eels
for reasons scientists don't understand. What is the answer, how
do we look after this incredibly precious resource? We need to make
sure all the conservationists are working to the. There has been some
very good work done in the River Wensum, with places for the fish to
spawn in. What we need to be thinking about is every river in
the country should be treated like a really precious nature reserve?
Indeed, yes. They are corridors for wildlife to move, in these times of
climate change we will need them more and more and more. It is up to
us to look after these wonderful wildlife refugees.
   refuges. He's absolutely right. We care so
passionately about all of our terrestrial wildlife, but without
people like you and the fantastic pictures we have this week, you
wouldn't know what is going on in the river. River are used by all
sorts of people, anglers, naturalists, bird watchers, people
boat on them, canoe on them, people swim in them too. What is really
important is we educate efpb as to how important the wildlife is there
too. It is about management. It is that thing, as you say, in
terrestrial areas you knowment when you go to a tern kol he knee, you
wouldn't    colony, you don't walk through it. People will walk
through a river, they don't know they are destroying a fish hatchery.
On the graveled areas, tramping that is an act of vandalism, it is
done through lack of knowledge. So it is really important that we
consider that, particularly when species are in such serious decline,
95% decrease in the eel population, that is in the Thames, that is
equivalent to birds, house sparrows, that is always in the news, we need
to have more profile. You have been finding out about one
of his favourite fish. Let's get back on to the positive, Hugh has
fantastic pictures this week, this is illustrateing the point we have
been making. When barbels spawn, they need fast flowing water full
of oxygen, they need to find a gravel patch, and the size is
important. The females aggregate on the patches, they stir up all the
gravel, bringing up the silt, then they dig a shallow pit and lay
their eggs in to it. Then the competition starts again, then the
males move to those eggs and compete for the opportunity of frt
liesing them. The eggs are    fertilising them. The eggs are two
mms in diameter, the they are sticky. A little patch of gravel
can be very important for this and many other species of fish. Be
careful on river. If you have fish, insects and bird. One of our
favourite river birds is the Kingfisher. Over the last few days
our cameraman has brought you his Kingfisher diary. He finshes his
lovely tale of these gorgeous birds today with the latest arrivals.
After nine or ten days staking out the Kingfishers and the hide. I was
rewarded in the morningment for a moment was chaos, there was birds
flitting up and down, it is difficult to focus in the fog. As
the fog started to disappear, I could see three chicks. They hung
around not long. The male took two of the birds towards the quartery
into the field, he offers them a fish, he doesn't give it to them,
he flies off and they follow him. One of theic chs stayed next to the
female. She was tucked into a    chicks stayed next to the female.
She didn't know how to take the fish, the female kept pointing it
at her. I got a few shots of the female and the male, they mated in
front of the chick, which I have never seen before. The next day
when I went down to the river the fledgelings had gone, I didn't see
any baby Kingfishers. The male and female were really busy, they were
clearing out the whole nest. They take turns, they do this lovely
swappover, where the female or male will sit outside and do a single
chirp, it is a reassurancement they may be preparing the next for a
second or third brood. I have had a fantastic time filming
the Kingfisher, the River Wensum is a great river. I have filmed
behaviour I have never filmed before. It was nice to spend the
time getting to know she is wonderful little characters.
Sadly that concludes our week of river reports. Great thanks to Ian
and Mark and Hugh. Over to you Simon.
From a windy hill in Dorset, with the fleet and beach behind me of
the before we look, in detail, again at the swan family that we
have been following here, let's take a look at what it is that
makes Abbottbury so special for mute swans. It is fresh water, the
lagoon, the fleet, a saline or brakish warter, which the cignits
can't tolerate, there is a fresh water stream that runs in and they
congregate and nest. For many of them it is partly because Dorset is
a county, and this part of it is relatively poor for fresh water
bodies. All the mute swans, for hundreds of years, for miles around,
have come to this area. Not only that they were encouraged to stay
here by the amongst, who fed them, and ate them. That, of course is
not why they are here in large numbers, they are here for
conservation purposes. It is really an extraordinary spectacle,
particularly at this time of year, when so many birds, 130 pairs this
year, are breeding, giving rise to 500 cignits. Of those 500 cignits,
I have to say, only about a third, one in three is likely to survive.
So intense is the competition and the challenges for those young
birds. Having said that there is a strong chance that some of our
family will survive. Let's go down to the live cameras on the fleet
right now. You can see us, we're the little dots on the hill, if we
pull back we should be able to see where we are in relation to the
large herd of swans, that is what a large congregation of swans is
described as, a swan hrd, man of them settling for the evening. Also
at the nest we will have beautiful live images of the swan family,
sadly, down to just three cignits, still on the nest. Looking as
though they will prepare for a night under their mum. Let's hope
they fare better tonight than last night. We lost two of them. As well
as watching our swan family, we have been keeping an eye on the
wildlife of the woodland nearby, another family, you may remember,
we have been charting the progress of a roe deer family.
It has been pretty wet and damp here over the past 36 hours or so,
and that is fantastic for roe deer, they love it. They seem to go into
feeding overdrive when it is raining, particularly browsing on
leaves, which, of course, are covered in moisture, they are
getting two in one here, they are getting plenty of nutrition, at the
same time as a drink. Our little kid, the youngster, none the worse
for the wet weather, being carefully tended by its mother. Not
long now before that tiddleer will follow its mum the whole time, when
we have sufficient strength to run away from various predators they
will start to follow their mother everywhere. Super scenes. That is a
wonder of reserve owned and managed by Dorset Wildlife Trust. Those
young swans we are talking about, will have to leave the nest in the
future, they have to feed, there they will have to go on to the open
water. When they do they will face a number of dangers. Among those
dangers are other swans, because big male, territorial swans, can be
enormously powerful, they have lots of disputes amongst themselves,
like that, I have to    powerful, to witness a fight like that is so
breath taking. It is so fast and dramatic it is hard to see the
detail. Let's take a closer look at the fight and see what is going on.
The birds, first of all, are trying to purchase a grip on each other's
neck. They have serrated bills, they are using that beak and bill
to try to grab their opponents neck, much as someone isfieding in Judo
will grab the sleep of their ap ponnents, then they bring their
wrist    opponents, they bring their wrist into play then, he has
a worn one from repeated scraps. He will try to knock his opponent with
his wing. It might sound light weight, these are big birds.
Watch the power and impact of that wing coming down on the opponents
neck and back. You have to remember some of these swans are weighing
15 16 kilos, for that bird to get in the air, it has to have a lot of
muscle to move the wings, they are using all of that muscle to thrash
each other around the back and the neck. It cans calculate to a very
bloody affair, look at the power that the bird on the right is
exerting on his opponent. Just to give you an idea of the scale, a
swan that weighs 17 kilos, it is the same weight as a Staffordshire
bull terrier. I once got very close to a nest where the swan was
nesting, the female smacked me with the wing, and knocked me clean out.
She caught me on the temple. Some of the people who work here had
their wrist broken. They are handling the swans the whole time
and dealing and managing them. You are bound to have the occasional
scrape, by and large they will not give you trouble, so long as you
give them respect and distance, particularly during the breeding
season. Right then, now I will give you a little song,There will be
bluebirds over The white cliffs of Dover
Actually, you know what, not bluebirds, but blackbirds, of a
sort, one of our Springwatch only natural to want to get home,
and ravens, one of Britain's most iconic birds, have been away from
their home, here, in the south east of England, for a very, very long
time. Now we are back, and so am I. I'm Richard Taylor Jones, I'm a
wildlife cameraman and photo er, I have an obsession with ravens. That
started when I met my wife because of them. She was a press officers
at the Tower of London, I was a cameraman there trying to film the
birds. Since then, they have always turned up at very important moments
in my life. Most recently they nested outside my old house in
Bristol, which I had been trying to sell for three years. Within weeks
of their arrival, I had a buyer, moved myself and my family back to
Deal, and where I grew up. After 120 years absence, due to
persecution, I heard that a lone pair of breeding ravens had
returned to the cliffs. Fascinated by this mysterious coincidence, I
set out to find the birds and get to know better, what seem to have
become my lucky dark stars. This is one of Britain's most
industrial landmarks, finding a raven, a bird that is supposed to
be a symbol of wilderness, is probably the last species you are
thinking of, but they are here, definitely here, it is just a
question of finding them. I started locking for these birds
in February, they are one of the earliest nesters. Things didn't go
to plan. Filming the birds won't be easy, the tide is coming in, it is
about time I really made my way home. But as the weather improved I
returned, and to my delight a raven appeared. White cliffs, big
blackbird, we have our raven. I'm so excited by the bird's return,
because over the last few centuries, they were lost from Kent, and most
of Britain. Pushed to the of existence by humans, because of
their reputation for killing livestock and being harbinjers of
doom and detruction. In the 20th century they were protected. In the
last ten years, ravens have finally exploded back across Britain,
reaching from their haunts in the north and the west, to the north 
east of the country, the white cliffs being as far as they could
possibly go. These birds as ravens have made the comeback.
It is easy to identified ravens in flight from other crows, because of
their big, wedge shaped tail. Today it is not only me that is watching
the birds closely. Oh, that is a peregrine. You might not think a
peregrine falcon will be bothered by a raven, they are, afterall,
killers themselves, but ravens, well they are big, powerful, strong
birds, and peregrines, they don't pose too much of a threat to them.
There have even been stories of ravens going into peregrine's nests
and stealing the chicks. He's gone right for him there. Seeing what
great flyers are is superb. But to really complete my mission, I want
to catch the two adult birds together, evidence there is a
breeding pair. It has taken me months of trying, but eventually,
success. Finally, I have got both birds
together. A pair of ravens nesting on the Wight cliffs of Dover, the
only pair of ravens in the whole of Kent. These birds represent just
how nature is returning to this very urbanised parts of Britain. It
is an exciting time for the cliffs. And for the people that live here
Fantastic birds, so good to see them coming back, I can tell you
that pair successfully fledged young this year. Brilliant, hang on
a second, is this something missing? Martin. Where are you?
have been banished, I'm freezing out here, I'm in the pen Thorpe car
park, why am I here? It is a very good reason. We're used to getting
the intimate views inside the nests, where are the nests? Let's have a
look, up there, if you can see, that there is our greenfinch nest,
it is out here in the car park, the little chicks in the ivy, tucked
away, beautifully. That's that one, carry on in now. We have to be a
little bit careful when we are around the nest, there are
microphones on them, there is warnings about mining your language,
there have been a few slip ups on the webcam, sorry. This one is
absolutely fascinating, this is a nest Kate has mentioned it, but we
have not featured it, can you see all the bits of needles there. That
is the duck nest, a Mallard, can you believe it she's not there.
That is the joy of live TV, she's gone. She has covered up the eggs
with down, so they are warm and cosy. Come along, let's have a look
around, welcome here to the Springwatch city, here it is,
everyone working away. This is nobody here now at all, believe it
or not, we tried to work it out, there is about 90 people in the
extended Springwatch family, they are all inside these trucks now,
because we are on air. Let's find another bird's nest, another
favourite, round the corner here. Here we go. Now here, that's the
study in there. That is where Kate and Chris are right now. But have a
look now, come in here. Can you see there, that is the nest there,
right about to fledge. All the pictures coming from the nest,
where do they go? They all go here, into the great big grey truck, that
is where our wonderful story developers live, I say live,
practically 24 hours a day, let's go in and see if we can actually
meet up with any of them. Let's go. Here we are with the story
developers, this is where they live, work and breathe, everything on
screen. This is heather, hello. You probably, if you have been on the
webcam messageboard, you have probably spoken to hether, this is
what she looks like, rather gorgeous, anyone talking to you
right now? We have lots of excitement about the swallow, which
are due to fledge any moment, people are on the edge of their
seats. Slight concern about the greenfinchs, because they are being
fed very often. How long have you been sitting here working away?
Since 2.0 this afternoon, and we will be here until 12.0 tonight.
How many story developers are there in total? 12 in total so we can
watch around the clock. Massive thank you to the story developers,
if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have all the wonderful pictures and
stories. We have our own story developers, watching the wildlife,
how about you watching the wildlife at home and becoming a recorder too.
You know the RSPB, the Big Garden Bird watch, they are doing one now,
they are calling it Make Your Nature Count. It is like the garden
bird watch, you go out for an hour, perhaps with a glass of roz, you
record the wildlife, not just birds, insects, creepy crawlies, you write
it down, you submit your results to the RSPB. There is a link on the
website. It is important, but fun. It gives a very important snapshot
of what is happening in our gardens. Don't delay, it finshes on Sunday.
When you are in the garden you might want to take some photographs,
if you want a little bit of inspiration have a look at this.
My approach to managing my garden is minimalist, I let it run wild,
you like how everything intertwines and interweaves and it becomes a
rich tapestry, most people pull up weeds, leave them because they are
popular with the insects I get here. I'm Jay Dieks, I live in slsbury in
Wiltshire, and I have been taking wildlife photographs for six years.
Most people think it is animals, but for me it is about insects. I'm
a graphic designer by trade, it is all about detail. That is
fascinating, it is a whole new world, and right here. My garden
might be small, but the world I photograph within it is vast.
I see nature programmes on tele, showing me the Seringetty and the
huge range of animals you get there, I come to my back garden and I see
just as diverse animals out therement one picture, that is a
favourite, of an aphid with a ladybird at the front. It looks
colourful, you can see the ladybird has eaten half of the aphid already,
and the aphid is still alive, that is rather horrific, like the loins
on the planes. I knew I would probably see some death in my
garden, I never thought I would witness new life. Another favourite
photo is of an aphid giving birth, to me that is incredible to watch.
If you have a small garden, you can still get incredible enjoyment
going out and looking closely. All manner of insects and little
creatures become apparent. Fantastic, absolutely. It is all a
question of scale, if you can imagine you are that big, then your
back garden is the seringetty. Last year we brought you an exclusive
with great news, it was bustards, last year, for the first time in
150 years, we recorded two of them had hatched. You named them, you
called them rhubarb and custard, one of them is still alive, not
sure which one. But they were extinct in 1832 and Dave Waters,
and the RSPCA have been working hard on the project, this year
there are no fewer than four nests and two pairs of chicks have
hatched. A significant improvement, and a step towards a sustainable
British bustard population. That is completely brilliant, part of that
success is due to funding, these things do take money. Some of that
money came from a brilliant organisation called the BBC
wildlife fund. The money that comes to the BBC wildlife fund, comes
from you. We are going to be fundraising again very soon, we
would love you to get involved. on line, the website you know. You
can link through from our website. See about getting hold of a
fundraising pack, read the blogs there and communicate with us, tell
us what you will do about fundraising. The fund is fantastic,
it "cherrypick"s projects where the money is spent on conservation,
intelligent conservations that work. Projects like the bustard.
projects around the world. We go back to Dorset now.
Welcome back to the Dorset coast. Beautiful evening now, a bit breezy,
let's see what is going on in the nest. What a touching scene, one of
the three surviving cignits nestled in its mother as back. You couldn't
ask for more. It does look so passful. It looks as though nothing
could go wrong, I sincerely hope nothing goes wrong for this family.
They have already been through the mill, they have lost at least three
of their number. We are left with three cignits that we can be sure
are surviving from the original clutch of seven. They face a long
night ahead, lovely contact between mother and youngster there. That is
essential for them to stay together, to stick together when they begin
to venture away from the nest. There are many families of swan, as
I have mentioned, we have had cameras stationed around the fleet
over past 24 hours or so. We have witnessed dramatic events, they are
harrowing, but there is a happy outcome. Look at what happens from
time to time when tempers flair. Adult territorial male swan, does
not want the neighbour's kids on his patch, there is the mother
coming in to defend her family. There is nothing like the same
power, she can't take him on, her mate tries to deflect the attention.
It looks harsh, this is what can happen, it can go horribly wrong to
the point where a chick is drowned and killed. It makes sense for the
birds to defend their territory viciously, but here, this is quite
an unusual occurrance to see quite this protracted an attack,
eventually the mum does manage to pull the attention of this rather
aggressive male away from her family. He has one last go, and
where is the safest place for a chick to go is on its mother's back.
Mute swans are unusual amongst the swans, they very often have that
your cignits riding on their back for security, warmth and comfort.
Crikey I would be there too if I had that many big aggressive male
swans chasing after me. We will be watching our family. It is not just
the swans we have been watching here in Dorset. It is all the other
wildlife of the neighbourhood. Take a look at this, something that
happened just outside our hotel. It is aed road, I know, look what's
happening just beside the road where they are staying, buzzards,
big birds that can hover with the head winds they are still while
their bodies are still. What are they looking for? Whatever it is
they are defending it viciously, from the more mature birds are
protecting their quartery, what could they have found, a large
carcass, a rabbit? No, it is worms. Invert breaths, much like the
kestrals, buzzards are not too proud to pick up the odd bug when
available. They spend a lot of time doing just that, that is one of the
reasons they are such a successful species, they adapt to the
situation around them. It is not just the buzzards we have seen
around the lanes of Dorset. We witnessed the great Dorset hedge
mystery. We were just driving through the Dorset lanes, and we
came across a natural phenomenon, look at this.
What is it? I tell you what I think it is? No, I won't, what do you
think it is? What do you think it is? I'm not going to tell you. Do
no prizes for guessing right, but you will have the satisfaction on
Monday when we tell you the answer of getting it right, or wrong
accordingly. Quite an astonishing sight. I have seen it before, I
have never seen it on quite that scale.
I'm going to be doing a lot of diving over the weekend and
revealing some of the astonishing, beautiful and varied marine life of
the Dorset coastline, all of next week, hopefully, we will be doing
one or two live dives too. Always a giggle that, I can assure you. That
is    we will be keeping a close eye on the swan family. We will
bring you news of them on Monday. In a little while, I will be back
on Unsprung, now we go back to Chris and Kate.
Thank you very much. Now, let's have a final look at our live
cameras this week. Let's go to the swallows first. They are looking
very big. Quite a lot of movement in the nest, do you think when we
come back on Monday, these guys will have fledged? By my
calculations they should have done, they have been doing wing
exercising, their beak is looking formature, big eyes for spotting
finchs, let's have a look    greenfinchs, they look like a great
still on top of the head. The wing feathers when open are not just
long enough. They might be here on Monday. A final look at the newest
character, the spotted fly catcher, isn't she just gorgeous. You only
want to look at it because she looks so cute? There is nothing
wrong with looking at things that are cute. Keep an eye on the all
going to the website. Then, we have lots exciting things for you next
week. We certainly have, haven't we. I don't want to know about that.
Put it away. Next week Martin and I are taking to the treats streets of
