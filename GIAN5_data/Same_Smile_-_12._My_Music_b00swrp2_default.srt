It's nice to see you, Dariush and Nathan, with Mogo and Moosh.
Did you have fun today?
  Yeah.

Dariush, tell us about the adventure you had with Moosh.
I took Moosh to meet my mummy.
I showed Moosh my bedroom.
We put music on.
He's got a good voice.
We went to the park.
I played my harmonica to Moosh.
He liked it.
He even had a go!
I love Moosh.
  I've got a present for you, Nisha.
  Thank you, Dariush!
It's a harmonica!
Thanks so much, this is a great present!
We'll have great fun with this. I'll put it in the Same Smile suitcase.
So, Nathan, what did you do with Mogo?
Mogo loves music.
We make drums.
I was noisy.
I love making sounds.
Music is fun!
I got this.
I love it, it's a microphone!
This is great!
I love that.
Do, do, do, woah!
I'll put that in the Same Smile suitcase, too.
So Moosh learned the mouth organ and Mogo learned the drums!
Making music is fun.
Sometimes we sing, sometimes we play instruments,
and sometimes we just hum to our favourite songs.
The thing we all do the same when we're having fun making music is...
Yay, smile!
With all your lovely gifts inside, our suitcase is even more special.
Come on, Mish.
Come on, Moosh.
Come on, Mogo. That's it, big cuddle!
We've had such a lovely time playing with you all today,
but we've gotta go!
Bye!
So take care!
Bye!
I hope you had a great time, too,
finding out that we're all the same, but different. Bye! See you soon!
