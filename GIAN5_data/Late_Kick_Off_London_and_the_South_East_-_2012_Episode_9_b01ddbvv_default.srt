of the goals from all of our boys at the weekend. And we forced a
Vale, we could not beat any of them! Good evening, all. Joining me
and Mark Bright in the studio, a man who can cover two clubs and two
divisions, Jason Euell of Charlton, on loan with Wimbledon. Can you
compare the new Wimbledon with the old? They are very different in
ways. But the tradition is the same. They want to be successful. It's
been a very good few years, happy times at Wimbledon. Plenty more
from them throughout the show. We are going to start with Barnett.
Barry Fry, Alan Mullery, Ray Clemence and Peter Shreeves, some
of the famous names that have barked orders from the Underhill
dug out. But the ground could fall silent, as they plan to move away
If we had to move, then I would still go with the club. But I would
hope it wouldn't be too far away. Yes, it's very traditional. It's
fantastic, fantastic memories. But we have to move forward. I'd like
to think they could find their way to stay here. But there has to be a
lot of coming together from the chairman and Barnet council. There
is no place like home and no other home that's quite like Underhill.
Barnet have been here for more than 100 years. But possibly not for
many years more. A row with the local council has led Barnet to
announce next season will be their last at Underhill. The famous
sloping pitch as witnessed plenty of drama, none more so than last
year's great escape. We scored early in the second half. You could
hear the crowd at the other game that was going on, they were losing.
Because we were so close we were getting the results through. It was
really strange. It felt like we had won the League, which is bad in a
way because we had just stayed up. But we had to celebrated because we
were buried with 10 games to go. It's an achievement in some sense.
That achievement may be one of the last for Barnet fans to say that
their long time home. With a move on the cards, the question is,
where to? This is the hive, the state of the art training ground in
Edgware, opened by none other than Fabio Capello in 2009. Alongside
these impressive facilities, the initial works of what was once
going to be the home of non League Woolston. Is it now where Barnett's
long term future lies? We either use do hive as a temporary stop gap
and then moved to an area where we can have a Pedrena stadium, or
perhaps we can build on it and use it as the permanent stadium. What
we really want to do is find somewhere where the local council
will accept us. We hope that the fans realise the bigger picture and
that when we move from Underhill that they come with us and still
supporters. We will still be Barnet Football Club. Do you think it
would be a shame if you had to leave? A big shame, definitely.
Since I'd been at the club, which had really good times. It would be
a real shine to move out of the area.    shameful stop for many,
Underhill will always be wet bonnet's heart is. But their future
home looks set to lie outside of the area.    where bonnet's heart
The future of bonnet, they are certainly going to move away from
under Hill. You can see both sides. The training facility could house
them. But then they are seven miles away from the place they call harm
   home. Ideally, they could stay in the borough. But loads of teams
have had to move out of their stadiums. I'd have to say that the
chairman, I know him and there is no glory in being the chairman at a
club like that for 20 years. It is hard. They are trying to make sure
that the club survives. I think the hive is where it is at. It got to
move there. It is seven miles. Jason Cann probably tell you more
than me, the fans want the association with their club in
their Barrett. You have to look at alternatives. The fans are probably
saying that I don't support the club, but it has to survive. That
stadium, if they competed, it will be ideal. They are working on
crowds of about 4000. Unless they get promotion to the championship,
they would need a bigger ground. But then they could extend.
Facilities are always a good thing about a new stadium. But some
people complain about a lack of atmosphere in a new stadium,
particularly when you have been somewhere like Underhill for some
time? When you look at the stadiums, if you can get to the levels that
you want, if you are going to build a 7000 stadium and they are going
to get 3000 or 4000, it could still bring a good atmosphere. But it is
what is long term best for the club. If that is the case, I think the
players would be happy to be behind that. Let's have a look at their
goals from the weekend. They went to Port Vale, desperate for a win.
They got one, even though they went behind to a Marc Richards goal?
Port Vale had just gone into administration. It is a blow going
1 0 behind. This is Ben May. He is on loan from Stevenage. He met his
team mates on the coach and then he scored? It's amazing, if there is
any position that can happen, it is a striker. His first touch, after
coming on? An unbelievable substitution. He scored seven goals
on loan at Braintree. He comes on there and he scores his first goal
in the lead    League. Let's talk about your team, Wimbledon. It's
been a difficult season. I know you did not play at the weekend. We
asked you about the old Wimbledon and new Wimbledon. A long time ago
you were at the original Wimbledon, he left in 2001. It must seem like
an age away? It does. Everybody can see what has gone on since I left,
the creation of a new football club by the fans. De get to where they
are in such a short space of time, its credit to the fans that have
created it, the players and the managers that have helped get the
team out there. You are playing one of our other teams at the weekend,
Dagenham and rag    Dagenham and Redbridge. It ended in a result
that you desperately needed. Jack Midson, on target again?
manager keeps saying that he is always scoring for us. It's down to
everybody in the team to start contributing to get more goals.
Michael Spillane with the equaliser and the winner from Kieran Djilali?
A former trainee at Crystal Palace. Good technique, good skill. Four
minutes from the end? He will be delighted. Jason Cann tell you more
about him. He's struggled with injuries and it's frustrating
because he knows what he can offer the team. If you are out with
injuries, with any player, he just wants to get back. That will keep a
nice and refreshed. Terry Brown has always said that the key is just
too desperately stay in the league. Is there the right sort of
positivity around, particularly after a result like that? Yeah, it
is a cliche, but a result can change the whole mood in the cab.
After last Tuesday's defeat to Plymouth, going into training today
is a completely different atmosphere. We are going to go into
the game tomorrow night, again, wanting to have the same feeling
once Thursday. Is it different being at Charlton, doing so well,
and then 18 struggling? Is the atmosphere different? Massively
different. But the position we are in, we just want to play games. You
want to get the results. If you have a bad result, you want the
next game to come around fast so you can put it behind you and move
forward. That is what we want to do tomorrow. Just stay in to the
division and build? Their ambition is to go up and get promotion.
Earlier in the season you were in contention of the play offs and its
tapered off. If there is a kick  start, you can do it next season.
We follow some other teams in League Two, let's see how they got
a win in five league games. They looked to have reignited their
promotion charge when Claude Davis put precision they overpowered two

box, two minutes after the break. Karl McFadzean kept a cool head to
drill his shot through the crowd. Relegation threatened Macclesfield
grabbed a lifeline when Mukendi volleyed in from close range.
George Donnelly's injury time equaliser left the often outspoken
Red Devils boss Steve Evans refusing to speak to some sections
of the media. For the 7th time this season, a
Gillingham game featured at least seven goals. The pick of the bunch
was the one by which newly crowned need to apprentice of the year POW
all gave them the lead. Matters were levelled from closer range
later on. Leitch Smith followed up his own shot to tap in from the
line. 60 seconds later, Paolo appeared to deliver the knockout
blow. Bush they staged a comeback. This volley made it 3 2. Five
minutes later, Ashley Miller looks to have secured a point. But how
costly was Danny Spiller's rush of blood to the head? Sent off for
taking down Gordon Brown. His team  mates held on until the 4th minute
of injury time, when Clayton made it 4 3 to leave Gillingham a point
Wycombe have spent almost the entire season at the wrong end of
League One. But that hasn't affected the entertainment of the
recent matches, with goals flying in at both ends. Richard Adams has
been to Buckinghamshire to experienced a unique take on how to
The hellfire caves in West Wycombe have in the past been known to be a

The cannot describe it. You just never know. One week we are good
and one week we are dreadful. nerves are shredded. With fans
wondering which side will turn up from game to game, even the players
themselves cannot put a finger on the unusual events occurrence on
the pitch. This season 118 goals for and against, what is happening?
It is phenomenal to be at that position in the league and there
are only five or six other teams who have scored more than ours, so
it is a crazy season for us. Sometimes you do not know what you
are going to get and we need to be more consistent. So are we
expecting a boring draw today because the cameras are here?
very much doubt it. Today's opponents Colchester and there have
been goals before, but I am expecting a 0 0 draw. The expected
goal first it did not materialise, but the game improved after the
break. Stuart Lewis went close for the home side. But remarkably after
36 games and over 100 goals, Wycombe had their first 0 0 this
season. We were confident are they coming into this game and it was
one of those and we approached it the same, but we could not get it
off. You told me there was no chance of the 0 0 draw and 90
minutes later it is 0 0. What happened? If it would have ended up
5 4, I would have taken that. come back again, can you guarantee
us some goals? Yes, I would like to guarantee that for you, but it has
been value for money here recently in terms of the performance and the
goals. Very spooky. Gary Ward it is very popular with the fans, but
they have scored 30 goals at Adams Park, more home goals, but they
have conceded just as many as well. Surely they have to tighten up a
little bit. They must start to keep clean sheets, not when we go down
there, obviously. That was incredible for them at home. But it
is your home games that are going to be important. Colchester are not
doing too bad, but on a game where you need a few goals they did not
get any, but they still have it in hand. He does not mind winning
games by four, but if you are a player are you desperately keen   
keen for a clean sheet? Yes, it sets the tone for the other teams
you are playing as well. If you are not conceding goals and you are
winning games, everyone will say they are hard to beat. It is the
whole team not conceding goals. is not good for the fans because
they do not have any idea what will happen week to week. How many times
do you hear the phase, what team it will turn up? But it is
entertainment. Wycombe are fighting it out at the bottom of League One.
At the other end it is Charlton. There was a reality check for them
Crisis at Trotton, well, losing two games in a row. Alan Judge cracked
home a 25 yard opener. Then it was 2 0 with less than 20 minutes
played. He then grabbed another and soon had his hat trick after just
40 minutes of football. Some Charlton fans had had enough. Those
that stayed saw Bradley Wright  Phillips pull one back after half 
time and then Scott Wagstaff made it 4 2, but they could not complete
the comeback. It has been a funny week at the Valley.
A bit of a blow to the peace hopes of making the play offs. The
Welshman fluffed his chance to bag the first half brace. The manager
said he was pleased with their performance. Simon Moore's goal 
kick went straight to Evans who raced around the keeper to score
his second. The Bees' boss will be looking for a replacement for Gary
Alexander this week. Orient would have fancied their
chances as Tranmere had not won in 12 and they nearly took the lead.
But it was the home side that went ahead, Andy Robinson reacting to
the rebound before finishing well. The lead was doubled just before
half time, sliding home after good work by Danny Holmes. David Mooney
blasted his chance over. It leaves them six points above the drop zone.
In it has not been the best of weeks for Charlton.
We are not show those fans were leaving, maybe they were going for
their half time pie. There were some people who were booing. It is
a strange situation to be in. has been a bad week and that was a
minority who were not happy with the performance, but we have to
look at the bigger picture. It is the first two games they have lost
at home all season, and they are 10 points clear of second place. You
cannot look at those two games. called them champions elect last
week. It is our fault. 36 games played an four defeat, put things
in perspective. Notts County are a form team. 10 points clear. Chris
will get the players and say, that is our blip and we have to move
forward from here. You do not want too many more are creeping in and
the gaps start shortening, that's when the nerves creep in. Four
goals in 40 minutes? I could not believe it myself. You have worked
with Chris Powell. What did he say to you when you went on loan to
Wimbledon initially? It was a mutual agreement to get some games
and come back and be fresh and ready for the back of the season,
because it is vital to have everybody ready. It does not start
going your way and the gap closes, and it could be nervous. He wants
to have everybody ready if that opportunity comes. Let's hope it
does not. A you looking forward to going back there? It is mixed
emotions. Being at Wimbledon is another experience for me, but I'm
conscious there is a parent club and it is like having two things
biting for the season and I will be looking forward to going back and
seeing the boys and help pushing for the rest of the season. We will
not call them champions elect again to next season. West Ham fans are
desperate to avoid the play offs and Brighton are desperate to stay
in. It could be where both teams are heading. Gus Poyet picked up an
award last night 24 hours after his team have moved into the top six.
Rodriguez Vicente scored his first from a free kick. Gus Poyet says
there is a 50 50 chance of holding on to the Spaniard. Next up a trip
to Blackpool. West Ham's home form is not improving. It is now three
successive draws at Upton Park, but they started positively. However,
it was ruled out. It took the lead when James Tomkins and Carlton Cole
failed, but Tomkins succeeded. James Coppinger forced the ball
over the line for Doncaster. West Ham are three points behind
Southampton with a game in hand. The golden boys are in striking
distance from the top half. Shaun Murray put them ahead. He praised
his team mates for the performance which saw the Hornets two up. Derby,
who looked like a plate of contenders earlier, it reduced the
Dougie Freedman said he was pleased with the points after this one, but
he could not have been pleased that some errors. That was a clumsy
challenge. Jay Rodriguez made no mistake from the spot. Wilfried
Zaha's pays it worried Burnley all afternoon. Darren Ambrose did the
job from 12 yards. Wilfried Zaha had been closely marked all
afternoon and were shown a red card for an off the ball tangled spotted
by the assistant referee. Palace remain way off the play off spots.
The Millwall boss said his team had chances to win this one, but Forest
were more clinical. Kenny Jackett bemoan some of the defending and
must have been frustrated when he saw Danny Higginbotham got his
first for Forest. They gave themselves some hope. Josh Wright
was denied a goal by the woodwork. Darius Henderson followed up for
his 18th of the season. But Forest eased their relegation fears. They
are seven points from the drop zone. Not a brilliant day for Wilfried
Zaha on Saturday, but last night he got some recognition and was named
the Football League's Young Player of the Year. Good news for Gus
Poyet who won the Outstanding Managerial Achievement Award for
promotion with Brighton. I have been lucky to be in the right club
at the right time. Saying that, you need to work and you need the staff
to be with you. If you make sure you get the right players, you
convince them, you make sure they want to play for the football club
and they believe in what we do because I have a different style,
you have got a chance. Congratulations to Jordan Cousins
who won the League One Apprentice of the Year and Tamika Mkindawire
who won the Player of the community award, the Player in the Community
Award. Brighton are coming strong at the right time. A end September
they had nine games without a win and the momentum died away, but
they have come back strong. Give credit where it is due, he is
responsible. They moved into a new stadium and they are now looking at
back to back promotions and they are big contenders. There was a lot
of respect in the room for Gus Poyet. It is hard for me to say,
but they are doing ever so well under his guidance. You are going
to take your Palace shirt off. Brighton are in a nice, tidy
position. West Ham fans are slightly concerned. How do you see
it panic out? Pretty exciting. Brighton has a little blip and came
strong and got promotion. They have been the outside bet to get there
or thereabouts. With West Ham there is a lot of expectation. Even with
Southampton. You have got to watch out for Reading. They have got
eight straight wins. I look at West Ham and Palace and Brighton and out
of the last six games they have got identical records. For West Ham I
think they have drawn up too many games at home. It is six. I know
you had a word with him at the Football Awards, there is
unbelievable ability. He was sent off last weekend. It is his first
red card. Take it as a complement, the team are double marking you and
that is when you get into the rough stuff, you have to rise above it
and do not react. He is young and he is learning. Hopefully that will
be the last red card. So many teams are interested in him already.

We came to win promotion and we started brilliantly. Nick McCartney
