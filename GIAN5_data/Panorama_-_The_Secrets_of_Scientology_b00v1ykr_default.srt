This programme contains some strong I am waiting for a man who says
he's going to blow the lid of the secrets of the religion of the
stars. To tell the story of the dark side of the Church of
Scientology. I think it's a privilege to call yourself a
Scientologist, and it's something you have to earn. Stars like Tom
Cruise and    Tom Cruise and John Travolta says Scientology works for
them. If they had had Scientology they would have been here today,
whether it's Elvis or Marilyn. Church says it's the fastest
growing religion in the world. But the charge against the
organisation... Or it's a dangerous cult. That obsessively records
people and their secrets, and those of the stars. I saw those videos.
Debate include personal things? absolutely. Things that Tom Cruise
He hugged me and told me he loved me. Then he laughed. Here, it's had
millions of pounds of tax breaks and it's trying to expand. So, a
force for good or something more sinister? The man I'm waiting for
will provide some answers about the Church of Scientology. But it's not
going to be easy. Because if you investigate them, they will come
for you. I know because I've done it before. Listen to me for a
second. Stop there, Tommy Bowe Stompe I don't understand the
nature of you. In 2007, I investigated Scientology. They send
their top handlers to try and stop me. One of them, Mike Rinder,.
Official spokesmen for the Church and boss of his Office of Special
Affairs. That never happened, ever, ever happened. It's a catch 22,
John. That is ridiculous. Another, his colleague, Tommy Davis. Buddy,
you got it, right here, right now. I'm real angry. In the end they got
to me. No, listen to me! You were not there! I apologised then and I
apologise now. But I'm entering that world again. This time I've
got help from the inside. This time I will know the tactics they will
be using against me. Because the man I'm waiting for is perhaps the
last person on earth the Church of Scientology would want me to meet.
That man, one of the men against me last time, the former official
spokesman of the Church of Scientology. Welcome to London.
Nice to see you again. That's This is a meeting I'd never dreamt
would take place. Three years ago, might Rinder did his utmost to stop
Panorama making a programme about the Church of Scientology. He was
at the centre of Scientology's attack dog operation. Mike Rinder
was the public face of Scientology. Loyal defender of the Church. Our
last encounter was three years ago. Those allegations are absolute
utter rubbish. Absolute and utter rubbish. Now he's defected. A
traitor. It was just a matter of I couldn't take it any more. I will
tell you, John, I felt like I had been freed. Mike is talking as if
he's been liberated. He is hinting at a dark side of the Church to
which he was once so devoted. But this was the moment, this was the
moment when you said goodbye, I'm out, I've had enough. This is
exactly it. It happened right here. But leaving came at a cost. He
became an enemy of the Church. His family, who'd stayed inside, would
cut him out of their lives. I knew as I was walking out of this
building that that was the last time I would ever talk to my wife,
the last time I would ever talked to my children, the last time I'd
ever talked to any of the rest of my family. Mike it was turning his
back on the church he joined when he was just six years old. His
parents were early converts, getting into Scientology nearly 50
years ago. That is the house that we all lived in in 1969 when my
parents were here. He shows me the Church's holy of holies, Saint Hill
in East Grinstead, Sussex, where he spent part of his childhood. He is
out of the Church but still believes in Scientology and its
founder, L Ron Hubbard. It has great significance to
Scientologists because it's the home of L Ron Hubbard. He lived
here in the 60s. That big building that you see over there is the
manner, the Saint Hill Manor. That was where he lived. L Ron used to
write science fiction, and then he wrote a religion. We are the only
ones who study the spirit so we have to use the word Scientology.
It was claimed Scientology could create a civilisation without
insanity, without criminals, without war. This was the centre of
the Scientology universe at that point. It was a very exciting place.
There was always a lot of people just thoroughly enjoying themselves
and enjoying the fact that they were a part of something that was
very new and very different. What is Scientology, how would you
describe it? It's very interesting. You've just ask a question like,
what are the contents of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and set
in one word. L Ron believed in a form of reincarnation. Through
counselling, they called it auditing, you unlock and examine
pain caused in past lives which scar your present. This couple are
training themselves to clear their minds, ready to absorb the message
of Scientology. The goal for a Scientologist is to reach a state
of enlightenment cold Clear, we can't all, unconscious thoughts
have been wiped out. You wouldn't express any of these emotions  
covert hostility, anger, boredom, paint   because you are well and
happy. The goal? To Clear of the But there is nothing clear about
the Church of Scientology. Since its birth it's been clouded by
controversy. I wanted to investigate this self styled church.
The accusation   it's a cult. The Church has long denied that it is
any such thing. Now it's a former official spokesman and head of the
Office of Special Affairs has left, bringing its secrets with him.
Church today doesn't really resemble the church that I knew
when I was growing up. There are a lot of things that are happening
all have happened that are really eating away at the core of the
religion from inside. People are not able to think for themselves,
they really are being suppressed, where they are being abused. They
live an unhappy life, it's not a But this is the face of the Church
of Scientology now. The face it wants to show to the world.
ability to eradicate drug abuse and awaken populations to the inherent
moral decency within them... All of this is now possible on a
previously unimaginable scale. L Ron died in 1986, the Church
lived on. A new leader, David Miscavige, rose to the top.
truth of the matter is that just me and we are the most powerful force
on this earth. Under Miscavige, best man to Tom Cruise at his
wedding to Katie Holmes, Scientology reaches out to the
stars. And the stars bless the church with publicity, whether it's
John Travolta handing out a aid in Haiti, or Tom Cruise at ground zero.
If you've heard we are the fastest growing religion on earth, it's
true. Also he says. The church boasts 11 million square feet of
property around the world worth millions, if not billions, of
dollars. It hasn't said how much money it's got, but it's clear that
church is worth a bob or two. And it's pushing for more. Check this
out, hears the crusade... More Churchers, more buildings, more
funds to be raised. You've got to locate a building. A perfect
building in a perfect location. This is the crusade. It's also a
church that has an aggressive attitude to outsiders. In 2007, I
set out to investigate the Church, but the programme became about the
extraordinary lengths the Church would go to try and stop me. One of
the main charges... That its spies on people who dare to scrutinise it.
And Mike knows what really happened last time. A load of horse shit.
Strangers watching me at breakfast. Day after day after day. We are
being followed by a Range Rover. Cars following us around. Again...
We are being followed again, it's a black Nissan. And again... And
again. Sidona or a Range Rover. It will track along this road shortly.
Of course, I may be completely paranoid. Though, there it is. Back
then, the church denied spying on us. I'm having you followed? It
seems to me that you are the one who's gone a bit creepy.
whenever I met a critic, the church seemed to know. There is a car here
and somebody has stopped. Mr Davies, I assume. Nice to me too. According
to Miscavige's agents, I was paranoid. I don't know what you are
talking about. Was I being paranoid? No, you were being
followed. We were being followed? Yes. Who gave those orders to
follow us? It would have come undermine... You've got no doubt
you were being followed by the Church of Scientology? No doubt
whatsoever. The BBC has obtained messages to and from Scientologist
high command against the operation on Panorama. They go between Tommy
and Miscavige. They also show that David Miscavige's office knew what
we were up to. Where we were Hide, Mike. High, Tommy. I have
nothing to shake hands with you on. I find it considerably obnoxious
what you are doing. Where we were Correct. We didn't fly to Vegas but
stayed in Florida and just drove up the road. Hello, E    Tommy. I was
just wondering where you were. Simple test. There's a gap, we were
in Florida and then we went to LA. Where did we go in between?
went to San Francisco. I was there. What do you mean, you were there?
followed you from San Francisco airport to the hotel that you state
that and that one that was sitting on the corner... I was there.
Church still says we were and spied on. David Miscavige says the
suggestion that he and his office monitored any such operation,
communicating with Rinder and Davies, is total nonsense. The
Church categorically denies it, too, but admits private investigators
were task to track and document us. With Mike Rinder, Marty Rathbun.
The two men pose a new threat to the organisation. Motty used to be
an inspector general of the Church. After 27 years inside, he left in
2004. Mike and Marty still believe in Scientology as a faith, but they
object to the way the Church is run. They are spearheading what they
call a Reformation. They say the Church is not expanding but
contracting. The Church says they are heretics and they are no longer
welcome in the church after years of incompetence and misconduct. We
are being filmed by that lady over there. That's funny. Well, she was
filming us. The camera is still in What have you got there? This is an
e meter. They are about to do some think to me which the Church would
not want them to do. The Church of Scientology fiercely copyrights its
scriptures and legally protects its practices, and that includes
auditing, the core of the face. First, you have to commit yourself
to any e meter. It is a simple device. It is a resistance meter.
Probed by the e meter, Scientologists are not what is
wrong to deep in their minds, so they can trace and banish negative
influences from present and past lives. Is this like a lie detector?
It detects the truth. It is a truth detector. Marty Rathbun was once
one of the top auditors. He dealt with Tom Cruise, Kirstie Alley and
John Travolta. I will pinch you, watch what the legal powers.   
watch what the needle does. Now, keep watching the Beadle, and
recalled the moment of the pinch. Yes! That is creepy. My mind
remembered the pinch, and that registered. Exactly. They believe
the e meter helps you uncover repressed thoughts. It did not take
Marty Rathbun longed to find a naughty thought of mind. You are
nervous all concerned? I am fighting this. I am thinking of
something I am not going to tell anyone about her.    tell anyone
about. This is a naughty thought. Does it tell you it is a naughty
thought? It tells me you do not want to share it. Can you tell if I
am agitated? You gotta do. They say that, once you have offloaded your
negative thoughts, you feel a better person. Scientologists are
obsessed with the mind, and that includes drills to alter behaviour.
But they say this knowledge can be used to unsettle and upset
outsiders, like me. If you have got a problem to that at... What are
you doing here? I came to talk to you. The technique is to push your
buttons. People have things that set them off. They are watching
very carefully. I am sure you compared notes, he has got a button
on this. So, he will push the button next time. I am not a bigot!
Your are a closed minded bigot. are a bigot. Tommy Davis said that
John Sweeney is a bigot. I am not a bigot. If I keep putting you off
like this, up I will drive you nuts. Every time you start to say
something, by cut you off, that is another way of getting you so that
you become emotionally upset. builds up like a dam. Finally, it
explodes. It is an end. I want to say something! You are not allowed
to say anything! Bigots cannot talk! In 2007, I faced a days of
pressure from be too much.    from the church. Then they took me to
the Industry of Death exhibition. One of the beliefs of the Church is
that psychiatry is evil, damaging humanity around the world off. For
90 minutes, I had a tour through madness. That a leading cytologist
talked me through what they say psychiatrists did in the Holocaust.
The psychiatrist said up the whole youth and Asia campaign in the
concentration camps. They decided who would be killed off. Then we
clashed again, and I lost it. No! Stop there! Listen to me for a
second. No! Listened to may! You were not there at the beginning of
the interview! Although I am not excusing my reaction, Mike Rinder
and Marty Rathbun explained to me I had given the Church exactly what
they wanted. It was the intention of Tommy Smith    Tommy Davis to
create at effect on you, to go due into a reaction like that. Tommy
Davis had announced the two David Miscavige specifically that he was
the person that should be dealing with you, because he could drive
you psychotic. The Church says I am just trying to falsely excuse what
it calls my totally unprofessional behaviour. It says no Scientology
techniques were used against me, and I cannot justify myself by
saying that Tommy Davis set out to aggravate me. But the messages to
the leader's office seemed to tell a different story. After I lost it,
Tommy Davis sent his message. the person who drives him more
psychotic than anyone. Did Davies Dist    debate is make    David
Miscavige want this to happen? Absolutely. No question. Mike
Rinder says these messages are typical. Any other details...

would be, did you figure it out? That would be five seconds after
the one before. What that stood for was some think offensive again.
ask the Church of Scientology about the abuse of staff and obscene
language. That was denied. It also says any such messages must be
forgeries. Around the world, the church craves respectability. In
Britain, the Charity Commission does not recognise it as a religion.
But it has won concessions as a not for profit educational
organisation, including tax rebates and rates relief worth millions.
The Church has contacts with government officials are. Charles
Hendry MP says he was speaking on behalf of Scientology constituents
when he put their case in 2005. Although it may be controversial,
undoubtedly they to a great deal of good. They have gone through
serious hoops, making sure they have the right to broadcast on
television, satisfying the broadcast Commission that it is not
a cult. But back in 1984, a judge courted    called it exactly that,
a cult. The judge said that the Church of Scientology was corrupt,
sinister and dangerous, and to capture people    it captured
people and brainwashed at them. So, a force for good or a brainwashing
cult? I am going back to the home Here, the most damning allegations
have been made against the church. But it is also where Scientology is
most popular, and recognised as a religion by the taxman. Its founder
even has its street named after him. I bump into Scientologists on their
way to courses. The Church of Scientology is the best church.
is fantastic, a tremendous amount of educational materials,
communication skills, handling life, we have a whole business programme,
how to run their businesses better. It changed my life. It really
changed my life, my dynamics, and I am having a ball. It has been so
beneficial, to make me a happy, stable person, more productive. It
has been tremendous. They seemed happy enough. But I am not welcome.
The Church wants me of the projects, they have refused me access, St my
last film showed me to be biased against them, and a liar. But there
are people who do want to speak to me, and they come from the heart of
it, the holy order. Their accusations threatened to blow the
Church apart. They are ex members of the Sea Organisation. The people
who run the Church, so named because L Ron Hubbard had been in
the American navy and liked things shipshape. Uniformed and regimented,
if you join the organisation, you sign a contract pledging to serve
the Church for all your life and all your future lives to come. It
In 2007, very few people were willing to be openly critical of
the Church. Today, that is changing. Claire and Marc Headley were
practically born into the church. They signed the contract, becoming
employees of the Sea Organisation, when they were 16. My mother joined
at the Sea Organisation when I was four. Now they are out. This family
scene is a far cry from their lives in the Sea Organisation. They were
there to help spread the message of Scientology around the world, but
inside they felt anything but free. There was 24/7 security cameras,
people everywhere. It is definitely a very strict environment. Fear and
intimidation for me personally and what I have observed with others,
the dominant control and emotions of my life for 20 years, certainly
the entire time I was on the staff. The couple have tried to sue the
Church, but the case was dismissed under an exemption covering up
reduce employment. They are appealing the decision. The Church
covers the most personal aspects of life. No sex before marriage, no
marriage to anybody outside. Clare, at the age of 19, realised she was
pregnant, and that is not on. is what their own policy states.
They are not in the business of raising children. It is not in the
business model. For Clare to have her baby, she would have to leave.
Fearing it meant leaving her only home and breaking from her family,
she felt an abortion was her only option. Two years later, the couple
were posted 2000 miles apart. in Clearwater, Florida, or when I
found out I was pregnant. I was not allowed authorisation, so I could
not tell my husband about it until eight months after the fact, when I
next saw him. Unable to talk things through, she had another abortion.
She is not alone. Other woman who have left to tell of similar
experiences. It was the most horrifying, upsetting to, deeply
disturbing situation I have ever been in. You could not say, I was
pregnant and I decided to have an abortion, because otherwise I would
have to leave? I would never see him again. The Church says she made
a statement at the time that she did not want the child and never
wanted children. It confirms pregnant women cannot remain in the
Sea Organisation, but they are free to leave with their husbands. It
adds, it does not stop married couples from speaking. I wanted to
know more about the hold the Church has over the lives of people in the
Sea Organisation. On the edge of the Californian desert, I meet
Marty Rathbun again. With him, Amy Scobee. Like Marty Rathbun, she is
a defector. Between them, they gave more than 50 years' service. Where
are we going? The International Scientology headquarters. There are
several hundred staff there, film studios, groups of managers. It is
where David Miscavige has his home base. He runs Scientologists from
there. Did you work here? Yes, for 20 years. It is the first time they
have both been back since leaving. In 2005, Amy Scobee broke her
billion year contract, leaving Oh, God, this is bringing back
memories. Here we go. Behind the gates are Scientology is
international headquarters. They call it Int or Gold. No staff
member on the property has to live outside of the fence. No sooner had
we arrive at when someone was on our case. Do you know those chaps?
No, they are hired people. Hello, my name is John Sweeney, I'm from
the BBC. Who do you work for? This is the nerve centre of the
global empire. The church describes it as a luxurious place of work,
rest and play. There's a communal pool and barbecue facility, where
the tennis courts or the basketball courts or the volleyball courts...
But the way Amy describes it was anything but. We are living here on
a restricted compound with no days off, family, lines being capped.
Sure, it's beautiful, the food wasn't bad, whatever, but it
doesn't justify... That is not the world we are trying to create.
Leaving is not easy. In order to go, duvets weeks of procedures, signed
statements praising the church and can be handed a bill which can run
into thousands and thousands of pounds. The Church confirms that
members to break their religious covenant have to follow a standard
procedure and pay a freeloader debt. It says this is a religious matter
between the Sea Org member and the church. You spent the best years
are up your life behind this fence. It feels the way you've been
telling it to me as though you woke up one morning and realised the
whole thing was... What? It's a dangerous cult. There's a certain
tolerance level that you are willing to meet because you do feel
it's your spiritual immortality at stake and your family at stake. I
didn't have any resources to turn back on. It was my life, my life
since I was 14 years old. And I was A dangerous cult... That's not the
word on Hollywood boulevard. Here, the connection between Scientology,
celebrity and success is written on the sidewalk. It really is fun.
Because there is nothing better than going out there and fighting
the fight then suddenly you see... When I think about those people out
there who are dependent on us. Being a star means a stellar
service. The celebrities get their very own churches, luxurious and
cosseted. Amy Scobee was in charge of these celebrities centres. And
when we go for a wonder, it seems we are expected. We've been filming
Back in 2007, Mike and Tommy had arranged for me to interview
Scientology's defenders of the faithful stop I put to them what
the British judges said, that it was a brainwashing cult. The
celebrities gave as good as they got. Then they refused to let the
BBC broadcast their interviews. But we can show them to you now for the
first time because the celebrities were happy to take part in Panorama
exposed. Scientology's film investigating us, put out after our
film investigating them. Executive producer... Mike Rinder. It's a
cracking watch! To this point, having only filmed interviews with
detractors, this is Sweeney's opportunity to find out what
Scientology really is from those who know best. Scientologists.
a sinister, brainwashing cult. Would you ever sit with a Jew and
tell them that their religion was a cult? No. Some people say... Some
people say... Some people say... Some people say that it's the
sinister, brainwashing cult. I know some people have also said that
women are really stupid and it shouldn't vote. Some people would
say you are a member of a brainwashing cult. You were
brainwashed. Do I look brainwashed to you? How dare you. What I didn't
know was what was going on behind the scenes. Tommy and    Anne are
to's son, and Mike were keeping the Office informed. The Office
That's my body they are talking But some people in Hollywood are no
longer in love with Scientology. Jaden    Jason Beghe, start of GI
Jane and Thelma and Louise, quit after 13 years inside the church.
Don't scream at me. Come on in, How do they treat you? You are
spoilt rotten. They just love bomb the shit out of you. And it's
sincere. It's not a routine. I could ask for anything. There would
be somebody who would be there to do it for me. But those days are
over. Jason is now campaigning against the church. A why did I get
into it, because I was interested in finding out about myself and
understanding other people. The same reasons anybody might get   
investigate a philosophy or religion. But I also kind of
couched that in the concept that even the best Mousetrap in the
world isn't going to work without cheese. And that slice of cheese
cost Jason and his wife a bob or two. About a million dollars.
Church says as a young religion it depends upon its parishioners as
its primary source of financial support. It confirms that some
services are free, but members pay fixed donations for others. It adds
that the donations of Jason and his Back in town, I meet Larry Andersen,
star of Martians Go home and star Injector assembly has separated.
You are at the threshold of your next trillion years. And also the
start of the Church of Scientology's recruiting films.
He's the phase that welcomes you in, and now he too is out. Larry spent
33 years in the church. I began to speculate that those early gains
and wins, as they say in Scientology, I was having was sort
of debate. It's the book to bring you in. Scientology features a
series of steps called Operating Thetan levels   OTs. And for each
level you have to cough up. The critics say that makes it a pay as
you go religion. After spending decades in the church and hundreds
of thousands of dollars, Larry did something he's not supposed to do.
He looks at Scientology's critics on the internet. As a Scientologist,
you are not only encouraged but really had your arms twisted never
to look at media. If you see a story on the church, turn it off
because it will only destroy the gains and you've got an octal now.
I said, I'm not going to do that anymore, I'm going to go online.
The Church says there is no such sensory. It adds people may feel
better if they were to seize watching or reading the news when
much of the media, such as Panorama, are merchants of chaos. When Larry
went online he discovered the secret that the Church had kept
from him for 30 years. At the heart of Scientology is this secret. Only
revealed when you've paid enough to reach Operating Thetan levels 3.
They call it the wall of fire. Panorama of told the sea could

planets and flown to locations near 10 volcanoes or more on earth.
it was L Ron's belief that humanity is infected by spirits of dead
space aliens banished to earth by an intergalactic warlord, Lord Xenu.
A revolt followed of the loyal officers against Xenu. He was
locked up in an electronic, modern fortress and remains there still.
Xenu is all over the internet. Ex  members have confirmed its
existence to me. And yet you don't get far if you raise the issue with
practising Scientologists. Back in 2007, I put it to be celebrities.
After all, many of them were operating theatre ands. Xenu, does
he banished souls from a... Alien souls, banish them to earth and
then been them up? Kirstie Alley, operating level beaten 7, says it
is untrue. But there is an intergalactic warlord who blew up
bits of aliens? Juliette Lewis laughed and giggled. The warlord
who 75 million years ago but people as aliens... You don't know what
you are talking about. It's like a movie. It makes you look weird.
Jason Begg does know about it. He made it 2 OT 3. The justification
for keeping it secret within those scriptures is that this is such
powerful information that somebody who hasn't done the previous steps
to arrive at being able to be exposed to this would actually,
probably died. They would go into something called freewheeling,
where they wouldn't be able to sleep, they would go insane and
basically die of pneumonia and lack of sleep. Keeping something rare
makes it more valuable. It's a way to keep people interested and to
pay a premium to gain the the information. In that sense, is it a
religion or is it a racket? know, they are not necessarily
When you walk into a Church of Scientology, no one will mention
Lord Xenu. That makes it completely different from other faiths. For
example, Christians don't say, what crucifixion? The church wouldn't
respond directly on the Xenu issue, but said than less than 1% of its
scriptures are unpublished and that keeping material confidential is
not unusual for a religion. It confirmed that knowledge handed out
in its highest levels is restricted until Scientologists are
spiritually and ethically prepared to receive it. One of the reasons
critics call it a cold is what they do with your darkest secrets. Does
it tell you it's a naughty thought? It tells me you don't want to share
it. Remember how the e meter picked up that naughty thought I had?
Auditing covers every aspect of your life. Work, play, sex,
And these secrets on to just between you and your Auditor. They
are routinely recorded. There's a specific VIP room for all the A 
listers. John Travolta, Tom Cruise, I audited Tom Cruise. There's a
shelf in there with a false glass mirror panel. Behind it, if you
Paul Lister about on the other side of it is a video camera. I was
working for the Scientology organisation and I installed over
100 rooms that had two cameras and a microphone in them where people
would get auditing. Is the camera obvious? No. In most cases it's
inside a smoke detector or a picture frame. We are talking about
pinhole cameras. The Church says it does film auditing but that this is
not a secret and has been announced publicly. Cameras are fitted within
walls to stop them being intrusive and unsightly. The Church also says
that auditing secrets are Sackur sand, protected by priest penitent
confidentiality and never revealed. What are you looking at? Marty
sitting in the chair, the e meter and on the opposite side of the
table is Tom Cruise holding the cans and the whole thing. I saw
those videos. And did they include personal things? Absolutely. Things
that Tom Cruise would not want people to know? Absolutely. But the
Church says recording is not a breach of confidentiality. Other
Scientologists are authorised to listen in. Selected staff are given
access for the purposes of training Auditing confessions, they say, are
secret, but this is the church that likes to keep records. It admits
that other personal information about you can be used against you.
So, beware if you dare to leave. When Jason Beghe tried to leave, he
had a visit from an official. comes over to my house with these
thick binders, with information and all for photographs. The official
tried to persuade him to stay by showing him the dirt on critics of
the Church. It was all of this stuff, this guy Rez address, this
stuff going on and on, and I am like, first of all, he was a
Scientologist and you are telling me he was in a dress? The Church
denies using such tactics to try to dissuade Scientologists from
leaving the church. When Amy went public, the church went public
against her. With details of her sex life. In its online magazine,
the church labelled her the adulteress and accused her of
wanton sexual behaviour. Something she denies. The Church also sends a
newspaper the dirt, she says to blacken her name. This was your
most intimate secrets. Yes. The details of how I had sex with my
husband before we got married, that should not go to a newspaper. They
made it the world's business by issuing a writ on the internet and
in a magazine that went to 100,000 people or more people. It went to
all of my neighbours are. Church admits selling at the
newspaper material. It claims the information was from an affidavit
signed by her, and that therefore not confidential. She deputes this,
saying the Church handed over handwritten confessions, which she
Again, we were not alone. Throughout my time in California, I
had shadows on my case. If there was any doubt that the agents were
working for the Church of Scientology, these pictures were
sent to my bosses at the BBC, claiming I must be biased against
the Church, as I was overly familiar with its critics. I left
California and headed across the USA to Clearwater, Florida. The new
front line in the war between the Church and its critics. A town with
more Scientologists per head of population than anywhere else in
the world. But it is also home to the Reformation movement of
independence Scientologists. They still believe in Scientology as a
blueprint for living, they just do not like the organisation or its
leader. Mike Rinder, the former Voice of the Church, is now a voice
of this new movement. He introduces me to Mareka James. She and her

Rinder's life for nearly 50 years. He married and became a father
while in it. Now he and his family are part of the battleground.

actions as a stunt. Mike Rinder says he is a victim of the Church
of Scientology's policy, this connection. People who accuse the
Church of being a court, for them, the most damaging charge is that it
splits families apart. The accusation is, if you leave without
their blessing, you will lose your family, still inside the church,

he drove his girlfriend to a medical appointment. I turned

My brother was there, my daughter, my ex wife. He had not seen his
wife and daughter for three years. They were joined by four officials
from the church, seven against one. The first words that I heard from
them, they were offensive. What the judge did not know was that Mike
Rinder was on the phone to a reporter, and the reporter was May.

somebody. It adds, disconnection is used against expelled members and
those who attack the Church. It says this couple have been declared

contact is theirs. Speaking to me would risk their and all of
