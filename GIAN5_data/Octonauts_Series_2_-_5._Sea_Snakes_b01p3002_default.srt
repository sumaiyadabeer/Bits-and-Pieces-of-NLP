Octonauts, to your stations!
Barnacles! Kwazi! Peso!
  Explore!
  Rescue!
  Protect!
Octonauts!
'Captain Barnacles, come in!'
On h! Dashi, what is it?
'Something's not right!'
I'm getting a strange weather warning.
  'Meet me in HQ.'
  Aye aye, Captain.
It's the biggest whirlpool I've ever seen
and it's heading straight for us!
We'll be sucked right in.
Dashi, prepare to move the Octopod to calmer waters.
Attention, Octonauts.
  There is a giant whirlpool heading for the Octopod.
  What?
Please, put away any items that could fall or be broken.
Activate launch now!
Huh?
What's that, Turnip? You found some strange objects in the garden pod?
TURNIP CHITTERS Well, let's go!
Jumping jellyfish!
They're eggs! But who or what laid them here?
What's tickling me toes?
Avast ye toe tickler!
Come out wherever you are!
HISSING Hmm.
  Oh!
  Hmm? Oh.
  Ah ha!
Ohh!
Huh?
  Hmm.
Agh! Snake!
Snake on the Octopod!
S s some penguins are so uptight!
  Octonauts, to the HQ!
  Huh?
Octonauts, what's going on?
  There's something aboard the ship!
  We found eggs in the garden pod!
  I saw it in the library.
  I almost captured it.
It was a snake!
A snake? On the Octopod?
  Are you sure, Peso?
  Yes! It was in my medical bag.
It must have been a sea snake. many kinds of snakes live underwater.
Was it one of these, Peso?
No. No.
That's the one!
A sea krait. They're the only sea snakes who lay their eggs on land
and not in the ocean.
Those must have been sea krait eggs that we found in the garden pod.
  But how did one get on board?
  I'll check the security cameras.
There!
Ah ha! So she snuck in in the middle of the night.
And now she's trying to get out.
Once sea kraits lay their eggs on land,
they immediately return to the water.
She can't swim out now, she'll get sucked right into that whirlpool.
Octonauts, find the sea krait and keep her on board until it's safe.
Erm...there's just one other little thing, Captain.
Sea kraits are poisonous.
  Poisonous?
Yes, but she'll only bite if she's scared.
We'll have to be very, very gentle with her.
These handy snake grabbers ought to do the trick.
Octonauts, let's find that snake.
Oh!
That whirlpool is stronger than we thought.
Dashi, activate steering wheel.
Aye aye, Captain!
Yargh!
  S s sounds like a s s snake.
Ah ha! Gotcha!
Oh.
Ah ha!
Prepare to be rescued, sea krait!
Stop right there!
I am so getting off this ship.
Follow that snake!
This must lead to the sea.
Oh, no, you don't!
Wargh!
Captain, the snake is escaping through the lab vent.
Let me see if I can help.
I need to get into the sea.
Why are you trying to stop me?
We're just trying to help. There's a dangerous whirlpool out there.
If you go out now, you'll get sucked right in.
S s seriously?
We're so serious!
So can we bring you back to your eggs until the whirlpool passes?
That's not how it usually works, Penguin, but s s sure.
  They hatched!
  That's great!
But, erm...where are the babies?
When baby sea kraits hatch, the first thing they do is look for...
Water!
Water! Find water!
Water! Water! Find water!
Captain, Dashi, come in!
The eggs have hatched! Is it safe for the snakes to leave the Octopod?
It's not safe at all! They'll get sucked right into the whirlpool.
Find those baby snakes and keep them on the Octopod.
Repeat. Keep those snakes on the Octopod.
Five baby sea snakes.
  How many should there be altogether?
  S s six.
Yah! One of them's missing!
Huh? Oh, no!
  Dashi, what's going on down there?
  One of the snakes reversed the ship.
I'll try to change direction.
It's no use, we're getting sucked in!
We're caught in the whirlpool!
We'll have to drive our way out of it.
  My baby girl!
  Snake overboard!
Captain, stop!
We've got to save her!
  Come on, Peso!
  Won't the whirlpool swallow us up if we go out there?
Yes, unless...
Tweak, do you have any suction cups?
Coming right up!
Baby snake, here we come!
The baby sea snake has large scales on its belly,
kind of like suction cups.
That's what allows it to climb.
And now with the suction suits I made,
Kwazi and Peso have belly scales too.
There she is!
Captain, the ship can't take much more of this!
Kwazi, Peso, you have to hurry, we have to get out of this whirlpool.
Aye, Captain. We've almost got her.
Here, little snakey snakey snake!
Oh, no! Yargh!
  Yeow!
Brave move, matey!
I can't believe I just did that!
Great work! Now hurry back inside.
They're inside, Captain. Now's your chance.
We've got to blast out!
OK, Dashi. I'll pull the brakes,
then you'll activate the turbo blasters.
Ready? Brakes!
Now blasters!
Blasters go!
  All clear, Captain.
No whirlpools in sight.
Good work, Octonauts.
And look who's here.
  Mama!
Looks like it's safe for you snakes to head out to sea.
Come along, children.
Yah! Water!
Thanks s s for all your help.
I knew this would be a nice, safe place to lay my eggs.
  S s see you later.
  Bye!
Well, Octonauts, it's been a busy night.
Why don't we all get some sleep?
  Eh?
