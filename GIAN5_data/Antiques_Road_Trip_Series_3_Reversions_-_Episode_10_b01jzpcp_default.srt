The nation's favourite antiques experts, £200 each and one big challenge.
  I'm here to declare war.
  Why?
Who can make the most money buying and selling antiques as they scour the UK?
The aim is to trade up and hope each antique turns a profit,
  but it's not as easy as you might think and things don't always go to plan.
  Push!
Will they race off with a huge profit or come to a grinding halt?
  I'm going to thrash you.
Yeah!
We're still out on the open road and in good company with auctioneers Charlie Ross and Charles Hanson.
  What's the oldest thing you've sold?
  You!
Charlie Ross has started to rely on some rather unorthodox ways of hunting out treasure.
I'm looking into my crystal ball.
Charles Hanson, meanwhile, certainly has an eye for a bargain,
but also an eye for the ladies.
  Yes.
  Jenny is available.
And his charm seems to have served him well. Charles achieved a major victory.
  As a young boy, I always wanted one of these.
  You can have it for £10.
We're selling now at 75.
While Charlie was left out of pocket and trailing in his wake.
That, 20 years ago, would have been 560, 580.
  It could be yours for 100.
  Oh, dear...
At only £40.
Oh, yes!
From his original £200, Charlie Ross now has a meagre £212.16.
Charles Hanson, meanwhile, has grown his £200 to a mighty £418.95.
Charlie's got plenty of ground to make up,
providing that their 1960s Ford Corsair doesn't break down again.
  Come on, you're a big guy. Come on!
  Ah, yes...
  Push!
But today, it seems to be running like a dream.
  It sounds better, doesn't it, today?
  I think it's fine.
  It sounds good. Hear that engine purr?
  Yeah.
Our two Charlies are travelling over 300 miles down the east of England,
all the way from Bridlington to Rye in East Sussex.
On this leg, they're leaving Beccles and heading for their next auction in Greenwich.
Their first stop is Lavenham, 13 miles away.
  But actually, they're going nowhere fast.
  Handbrake off...
  Not again!
You are the most incompetent driver!
  Get out. Let me have a go.
  Count me down   three, two, one.
  Three, two, one!
  Go!
  Keep pushing.
  I am.
Faster! Run!
Oh!
Have you seen that sign?
If Lavenham is ten miles away, I think ditch the car and we'll get there somehow.
  How are we going to get there?
  I don't know yet.
Get off! This is my patch! It's my patch!
He's got the gift.
  This is a shot in the dark. You're not going to Lavenham, are you?
  No. Bury.
  You're going into Bury?
  Do you want to come with me?
  No, I'll stay here.
  Bye!
  OK, see you later, Charlie.
I can probably take you to Lavenham.
  If I navigate you to Lavenham, will you take me?
  Yeah.
  You're wonderful! Poor Mr Hanson.
We'll do it the Hanson way. It might be difficult, it might be a free ride, but hey...
Stubborn as a mule, but he soon admits defeat.
  Fran, this is Charles.
  Hello.
  Charles Hanson.
  You know where Lavenham is, don't you?
Thanks to their angel in disguise, they finally reach their destination.
  Fran, thanks ever so much again.
  When I've done my shopping, I'll ask you back for a cream tea.
And at antique shop Timbers, let's hope the chaps don't walk away with a lot of dead wood. Ha!
  Hello, I'm Charles.
  I'm Jenny. Nice to meet you.
  I'm actually Charlie and he is Charles.
  I'm not Charlie, I'm Charles.
  Two Charlies.
  My young assistant.
  Yes.
  May we look round?
  Certainly.
What a couple of jokers!
Something has already caught Charlie's eye, but they're marked at a handsome £165.
I'm pretty certain late 19th century stoneware.
The paintwork's coming off, but I don't mind that. I wouldn't scrub them and try and make them better.
  Jenny, may I have a quiet word in your shell like ear?
  You certainly can.
  Take my arm.
  It is 165 on the label, isn't it?
  Yeah.
  I don't really want to pay more than £100 for them.
  No, that's a bit on the cheap side.
  No, a bit more.
  No.
  Oh, do them for 120. Could you do them for 120?
  No, a bit more.
  Could you do them for 125?
  Go on then.
  125, but I want to see how much they make in the auction.
  I will let you know. Come to the auction.
Not a bad knock down in price for a couple of kisses, but will the lions prove to be a success at auction?
What did I start with today? Just over £200. 210, 212, something like that.
Walk into a shop, what does Ross do? Blow well over half of it on one lot!
Elsewhere in the shop, Charles is certainly making himself at home.
Hmm...
Linen or underwear?
Sorry.
Right, OK.
  I like this ring here. May I have a look at it?
  Yes.
  That's for security.
  Well done, Sherlock(!)
This ring would date to the 1st or 2nd century AD.
And if you were Emperor Constantine, you know, what has this seen?
What has this key opened 1,000 years ago?
And it could be yours for £55.
Unlike the modern key ring which holds a group of keys together,
a Roman key ring was a finger ring containing an actual key. Got it?
  Do we have any provenance for this ring? Any history?
  I don't.
Provenance is so important in aiding value
to something which has such significant social history. We'll phone a friend.
Try Julius Caesar. Let's hope the vendor is in the mood for a deal.
Tell me, did you detect it or was it unearthed out the ground?
'It actually came from an auction in Germany.'
It came from an auction in Germany? I was hoping perhaps I could pay about £30 for it. He says "yes".
  Brilliant.
  I say "yes". Great, it's done.
I feel quite...I don't know, quite distinguished with a Roman key ring.
Although he hasn't verified the key ring's history, Charles suspects it's a good buy.
Let's hope the bidders agree. Elsewhere, competitor Charlie is on the hunt for his second item.
I'm going to ask you a very rude question here. I've been looking through here.
  Is there something here you've had so long, you really want to get rid of?
  Yes.
  Glove stretchers.
  Leather gloves would shrink from time to time,
so stick the glove stretcher down into the fingers,
press them a little bit and it just stretches the glove, so that you can get the glove on.
And these are solid silver and they're Victorian.
Go on, Charlie. They're only £40.
Could I buy those for 15?
  Yes, you can.
  Oh, goody!
Dear, oh dear. Chuffed with his first purchase, Charles is off to see the sights of Lavenham.
Lavenham is full of perfectly preserved buildings,
but this house, known as Little Hall, was once owned by identical twin brothers
who transformed it from a high barn to living accommodation.
Charles is going to meet Theo Gayer Anderson,
the grandson of one of the pioneering restorers, to find out more.
  What a marvellous place!
  Yes, welcome.
  Unbelievable.
  It's my grandfather and great uncle's house.
  It's a 14th century, timber framed house.
  Yes.
It was a labour of love to try and restore this building to something like what it might have been,
but they didn't restore it completely. We would have been looking up to the ceiling rafters.
There would have been thatch on the roof, earth on the floor, no chimney, just an open fire.
They've kind of restored it to what would have been left by the Tudors.
They were almost pioneers in this village and when they restored this house,
everybody else was modernising their houses.
Not only were the brothers in the vanguard of restoration,
they were also military officers interested in the arts.
They travelled the world with the army and collected exotic antiquities to adorn the home.
Little Hall is now looked after by Suffolk Building Preservation Trust
and Jean Beard is its chair.
  Can we have a tour of the house?
  Absolutely.
  Fantastic.
I'll follow your lead. You're the man of the house. I'll follow the Chairman as well.
  What a peculiar room, isn't it?
  I think it's absolutely wonderful.
  It's got sort of an Iranian, a Persian feel.
  Exactly.
Tell me what period these pictures come from.
You were right. These are Persian and they're 17th, 18th century.
  Wow!
  They had just enough to fill this room
and it must have given them a great thrill to be able to fit out a room so perfectly
and I think this was probably one of their favourite and most successful rooms.
  Are they on leather or just...?
  They're wooden panels.
  Fantastic.
So we're entering the...
  This is the inner sanctum, isn't it?
  This is a very cosy room.
  Yeah.
The focal point in here, sitting in the centre, is this cat. Why?
This is the Gayer Anderson cat. It's a copy of the one in the British Museum.
This cat is one of the iconic Pharaonic pieces that they have in the British Museum.
And it was found by my grandfather in Cairo.
A bit more enthusiasm, please, Charles.
I know this is a replica, but his grandfather brought the original Egyptian statue to Britain.
That would be an Antiques Road Trip dream, but it never happens to me.
This is about 2,500 years old.
And it probably would have been in a temple as a devotional object.
Here's my grandfather at his desk.
  This is the man himself?
  This is the man himself.
The Nefertiti bust is a copy that he acquired. It's not the original.
  This is a painting done by his brother.
  Yes.
There are lots of little jokes in it. One is this cat here
which is looking very much like the Gayer Anderson cat from the British Museum.
So this was his world. This is how he loved to spend his time.
There's a vast and eclectic mix of paintings and treasures in all seven rooms.
But sadly, the end of the day beckons and so it's farewell to Little Hall
and to the first day of shopping in Lavenham.
The next morning, the car is fixed and the chaps are back on the road.
They're heading for a car boot sale in Woolpit, 12 miles away.
The boys had a great start.
Charlie spent £140 on two lots.
Charles, on the other hand, hedged his bets and only spent £30 on a Roman key ring.
Oh, what a beautiful morning...
Geared up for their early start, these songbirds are in a fine mood.
  The car's packing up. The car's breaking down.
  The car's breaking down. The car has lost it.
  What's happened to it?
  It won't go, sir.
Pull in here.
  Sitting here is useless.
  Agreed.
  Action, Hanson. Come on.
  What are we going to do?
  Follow me.
Are they going for a pee?
I'm not a big fan of woods, Charlie.
If you go down in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise...
  Oh, Charlie, I've fallen over!
You'd better go in disguise...
Don't you worry, boys. We'll get you to the car boot sale safe and sound and fix the car.
Again!
It's 7am in the morning.
And the flat plains of East Anglia are alive.
There's a buzz about tat and there is so much tat!
There may be hidden gems too, Charles.
Isn't that a wonderful tiller? Isn't that fabulous?
In perfectly original condition.
Fantastic.
I think that's the way they used to farm.
A tiller was a mini plough used to break up the soil in the garden.
Well, I love it. I don't want to insult you.
  I have not come here to insult.
  Well done.
  You don't want to take 20 quid, do you?
  No way!
  I knew it...
  That was an insult. You knew an insult was coming.
Oh, well, if you don't ask, you don't get.
These Victorian stained glass panels are marked at £20.
  Hello. How are you?
  I'm fine, thanks.
  Good.
  Can I look at your windows?
  Sure.
  Aren't they sweet?
  Yeah.
A little bit of damage, but not much. No, they're in good order.
Pretty pattern. You could put that either side of a front door if you're doing up a property.
  18 quid.
  Oh, coming down.
  He's selling them.
  You're together. Could I tease you at a tenner?
  No.
  Oh!
  The very best.
  Fantastic.
£20 of my hard earned cash, madam, for you.
  Is there a £2 tip in it for me?
  No, there's £2 change coming to me.
  A hard man to do business with.
  Oh, I'm a shocker!
For the first time, I'm actually seeing some true antiques.
I quite like these little ornaments here.
  They're quite quirky. Being a footballer myself...
  You what?
  Being a footballer myself...
  I thought that's what you said.
So enjoying the great game,
in my opinion, anything with a football interest
could be fairly collectable and make something at auction.
These are quite quirky. We've got these football boots carved in treen or a softwood.
  What age are they, Trevor? 1950s?
  Yeah, I reckon.
  How much are they?
  A fiver.
  Between friends, a couple of quid?
  No, they've got to be a fiver.
They could be quite early. They could be 1920s and that's quite good.
  Your best price?
£4. We're going at £4.
  Done.
  £4, OK. And they're going. They think it's all over. It might be now.
I can't walk past these. I'm not buying much in the way of antiques, so I could do with a sausage roll.
Oh, marvellous!
  Thank you, my dear.
  Thank you. Bye bye.
  Bye.
You've been haunting me, you two.
  Every time I try and go...
  You're kidding!
  ..I think of this.
Would you like a sausage roll? Have a sausage roll.
  I tell you what, Charlie. I'll take 50 for it.
  It's gone up!
  You said 40 the last time I came here.
  I know I did.
  25 quid.
  No.
  Go on, 25 quid. I've got the cash burning a hole in my pocket.
  35, Charlie. That is it.
  That's it. That's it.
I'm absolutely useless at this competition
because I just keep falling in love with things
and I can't not buy that because it's...
  Oh, 35 quid. It's so fabulous!
  First of all, you've got to slap my hand, mate.
  I will.
  Give us a kiss, darling. Come on.
  Oh dear, oh dear.
  Permission, sir?
Well done, Charlie.
I am going to till the soils of Suffolk!
  See you, Charlie.
  Marvellous.
  Take care.
The car's back. Again.
  Marvellous.
  Sounds good, doesn't it?
So the boys are back on the road... for a bit.
I'm not quite sure where Clare is on the map, are you?
Well, it's around here somewhere.
Charles Hanson is heading south to Sudbury via a little drop off for Charlie in Clare.
That's a town called Clare, obviously.
Charlie, it's lovely, it's a glorious day,
and just to have that cushion of a whole £200 makes me feel at ease.
You know you've got Rossco just where you want him
and I have to spend my money to try and catch you up.
  Well, well, well!
  We're here.
With only £19 left, Charlie chances his luck in the hope of buying a final item  
an Art Nouveau bowl.
This took my eye and I always like to find something in an antiques centre without a price on it.
You live in hope! I'd love to know how much it is.
It's £24.
Um...
Would 15 buy it?
No, I couldn't go as low as that, Charlie, I'm afraid. I'd do it for 20.
If by any chance £19 would buy that, I'd be delighted to buy it.
  It sounds a silly price, but it's all I've got.
  I understand.
  I could do that for 19.
  Put it there. That's really kind of you.
  You're quite welcome.
A last minute, quick purchase for Charlie. Beat that, Charles!
  Good afternoon.
  Good afternoon.
  How is life?
  All right.
I'm running worryingly out of time, OK?
And I'm getting quite desperate in my search for the elusive object of art.
What are these over here, these big glass shelves?
  We'll take one out.
  Those used to have tapestries in them.
  And there's a pair?
  Yeah, a pair.
  These are quite nice.
You could make them into so many different things.
  You could put... Mind your head.
  Thank you, Mary.
  ..all your photos on the back.
I would have thought they're probably around 1910, 1915.
They're good quality and I quite like them, but if I was going to go to auction with a pair,
you know, one might guide the pair between £40 and £60.
  What's the best, Mary?
  30 quid to you.
  For the pair?
  Yeah.
Would you take perhaps £15 for them?
Yeah, I'll get rid of them for 15.
  £10, Mary?
  No, 15.
She knows how to deal with this young Charles Hanson. Mary can make mincemeat of me.
  I could eat you alive.
  She could eat me alive.
Has she made mincemeat of me on these screens? At £15, I can't ask much more than that.
Mind the step now.
  Oh, you are a clumsy clot!
With great care, Charles must get these items to auction,
along with his delicate travelling companion.
Charlie Ross started this leg with £212.16
and spent £212 on five auction lots.
The Victorian stained glass panel.
The 19th century stone lion.
The Victorian double tiller.
The Art Nouveau copper bowl.
And the silver glove stretchers, leaving just 16p in Rossco's pocket.
  Mwah!
  Well done, Charlie.
Charles Hanson began with £418.95 and spent just £49 on three lots.
The miniature treen football boots.
The Roman bronze key ring.
And the George V glass panels.
But who's going to win the upcoming auction?
Probably Charlie's one out of five item which I rate are the lions.
I really, really have high hopes for the stoneware lions.
If they could see me £250 £300, I might yet be back in the hunt.
So both our experts have high hopes as they get back on the road.
It's been a tumultuous journey from Beccles, via Lavenham, Woolpit, Clare and Sudbury.
So from idyllic Suffolk to the Big Smoke.
Their final destination is the auction in the London borough of Greenwich.
  London. The theatre of dreams!
  Rossco's comeback starts here!
  This is where, Charlie, you never look back.
  I know. I feel big profits in the air.
Greenwich Auctions have been doing business for 11 years
and Robert Dodd is our auctioneer today. So what does he think of our boys' buys?
The pair of panels, what would you use them for? Victorian stained glass panels,
they don't make as much as they used to make.
  Hold fast, gentlemen, the auction is about to begin.
First up, Charlie's stained glass panels.
  Here we go.
  And the bid's with me on those at £8 for the two.
Looking for a tenner on 'em. 10 I've got. Looking for 12.
Are we all done on those panels at £10 only...?
Oh, Charlie!
Not a great start for Ross.
But next up, his stone lions
  that both experts are confident will make a profit.
  Here we go.
  The bid's with me on these lions at £55 only.
  Oh!
Looking for 60... 5 with me. Looking for 70 on 'em.
They're worth all of that. 75 with me. Looking for 80. 80. 5 with me.
Looking for 90. Are we all done on a pair of lions at £85...?
  They roared away in parts.
Ooh, they didn't see that coming   a second loss for Charlie.
Next, the Hanson self publicity machine kicks in.
  Such a show off!
  Showing here, sir.
  And the bid's with me at £30 on these.
  Oh!
  Charlie, it helps.
  On the pair, are we all done...
  They're very nice.
..for the last time at £30?
Success!
A decent mark up on those.
You are the best. You should have a premises in Bond Street!
Now the Victorian soil tiller that Charlie fell in love with
at the car boot sale. Let's hope it ploughs up a profit.
£40. Looking for 42 on that. I've got 42. 5 with me.
Looking for 48. Are we all done, last time?
Selling this tiller at £45...
At last, a victory!
This might be the start of a comeback,
but only if the Art Nouveau bowl also does well.
Looking for 15. 18. £20, I'm out.
Staying at 20. I'm looking for 22.
Are we all done at £20? I'm selling it at £20...
One pound is better than nothing!
  A pound profit is great.
  It's a loss.
  It's a pound profit.
  Commission. 15%   £3, plus VAT.
I've lost three quid!
Looking for £10. Are we all done?
Here's the Roman key ring that Hanson bought for just £30.
When it first came in, I thought it was a piece dropped off a tractor.
It's got to start with a bid with me of £40 only on this.
45. 50 with me. 55. 60. 5.
70. 75. 80 here.
85. 90 here. Looking for 95. 100 with me. 110.
120 with me.
I'll take 125 if I have to.
I've got 120. This is cheap. Are we all done? Last time...
125. 130. One more bid? I want one more. Why not?
  135, I'm out. Looking for 140.
  Come on.
Are we all done at 135 on the piece of a tractor?
We're selling to that man...
Look at that, a whopping profit of £105!
You're the man.
Let's hope someone stretches to more than £15 for Charlie's next item.
  The bid's with me at £12. Would you like to play?
  Yes.
18. £20, I'm out. Looking for 22.
  I've got 22 standing. 24. 26 I need, sir. 26.
  Come on, Charlie.
  28? You're allowed to bid.
  I'm not in your league, but it's a profit.
Are we all done standing at £26 on the pair of glove stretchers
which are really handy? At 28. £30 I need.
I've got £30 standing. 32 there. Looking for 34. Are we all done?
  Doubled my money.
  This time at £32...
At least Charlie ends up with a profit.
  Last up...
  They're a pair of probably 1920s, maybe '30s treen football boots.
  Come on.
  Looking for 22. I've got 20.
Hello! Is there anyone out there? 22. 25 down here.
Looking for 28, sir. £30. Looking for 32.
If you get these, honestly, if you get these for £32, with your luck, go do the Lottery.
35 there. Looking for 38. 38. Looking for £40. £40. Looking for 42.
2 there. 45 I need.
45 there. Looking for 48. 48. Take 50. I'll take...
52 I'll take. 52. Looking for 55. At £52...
He thought these boots were a true collector's item and he was right,
which means that today's victor is Charles.
Goal! It's a hat trick.
  A hat trick all round.
  I give up. I've never had such a sound thrashing since I was at school.
Oh, lucky you!
Charlie started this leg with £212.16
and after paying auction costs, actually made a loss of £54.56.
He has just £157.60 to carry forward.
Charles, meanwhile, started with £418.95
and made a tidy profit of £128.94,
so he has a sumptuous £547.89 to spend on the next leg.
Come on, girls.
  You did very well.
  Charlie, you make your own luck in this business.
  You are a pro!
  Well...
Take me to Tunbridge Wells with my £146!
Actually, you've got £157.60.
Later on the Antiques Road Trip, the groaning Charlies momentarily lose a bit of focus.
..going on a summer holiday
To make our dreams come tru u ue...
But when their focus returns, they talk tactics.
  My dream will be to buy big...
  I want you to buy big and sell small.
That's coming up later. But first let's get back on the road with an adorable duo.
Auctioneers Charlie Ross and Charlie Hanson. They're not related!
  Are we nearly there yet, Dad?
  No, we're not there yet!
Charlie Ross is an amorous antique dealer ruled by his heart.
I keep falling in love with things!
  I love the old petrol pump sign!
  Yeah.
I love those. ..I'm in love with that tin.
I Lost My Heart To A Starship Trooper.
Ha ha!
Charles Hanson, however, is ruled by his head and is slowly but surely learning the ABCs of antiques.
It's a true, capital A for antique.
This is capital D for decorative.
All the time you're always learning.
And his education is paying off. Earlier on, Charles got an A+ with another major victory.
For a piece of a tractor... Selling to that man!
While Charlie was bottom of the class, having made no profit at all.
I give up. I've never had such a thrashing since I was at school.
From his original £200,
Charlie Ross now has a pitiful £157.60.
Charles Hanson, meanwhile, has grown his £200
to a whopping £547.89.
  You're just too good for me.
  Oh, I'm not.
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you...
On their road trip, our two Charlies are travelling from Bridlington
to their final auction of the week in Rye.
Today their first stop is Royal Tunbridge Wells.
The sun is out.
My £157 is burning a hole in my pocket.
Come on! Let's go and find a shop.
  My dream is to buy big...
  I want you to buy big and sell small.
His many years of experience lead Charlie Ross to the first shop of the day.
Hello!
  Ron Goodman.
  Charlie Ross.
  You've got a lot of treen in here, haven't you?
  Yes.
Basically, a name for small collectable items made of wood.
  Oh, look! It says The Beach, Hastings.
  Wow.
  Where am I going next?
  Hastings!
  You might be going to Hastings on your holiday,
but the auction is actually in Rye, 13 miles away.
However, this is a good collection, including a picture frame, napkin holders, small boxes
and an obelisk thermometer.
I'm willing to let you have all the Hastings objects for 155.
The other items wouldn't be any good if you were selling them in Hastings.
The auction's in Rye!
  140 quid, the lot!
  Shake hands, 155. 155 and we've got a deal.
150? Leave me a fiver in my pocket, Ron. Please, Ron.
  Listen, I've got five children at home...
  Well, I've got six.
  Are you sure about that?
  Are you a gambling man? I'll call.
  Yeah.
  150 quid if I'm right, 155 quid if I'm wrong.
I'm gonna call...heads!
  Hey!
  Oh, my God!
  150 quid!
And just like that, Charlie's only got £7 left.
Treen for sale! Fine treen for sale!
Charlie's now almost spent out,
but with a bulging wallet, old Charles is ready to splash some cash.
  Do come in.
  How are you?
  Not too bad, thank you.
  Are you a local lady?
  I live here, but I wasn't born here.
  Where do you come from?
  Germany.
  Oh, fine.
Now find something to buy.
Well, Erica, I quite like this down here.
Ah!
Tell me about that.
  Well, you know what it is.
  Tell me. I'll test you.
Em, it's about 1720,
  Good. She's good.
  And it's Worcester.
  Correct!
  It's so beautiful and so perfect.
  It is.
  If it had the smallest fault it would not ring like this.
  No.
  It's called the three flowers pattern.
  Yes.
  Dr Wall at Worcester, he would have made this
in what we call the first period.
Dr John Wall was the man who founded the first Worcester porcelain factory in 1751.
  Your price is...?
This has a big capital A for antique.
If you were a lady of etiquette and Erica was out dining with her friends in the 1770s,
she would drink her tea like so.
  This in the 18th century as a material was so highly prized.
  It was.
What's your best price?
Well, how much?
She said 16 to me.
  Your best price?
  Is 15.
  OK. We'll shake on it. £15.
  Lovely.
  Thank you, Erica.
  You're welcome.
  What's goodbye in German?
  Auf wiedersehen.
  Auf wiedersehen, Madame.
  That's French, Charles!
Careful.
As they're in Royal Tunbridge Wells, which has some of the finest period homes in Britain,
Charlie's going north of the town centre to explore one of them   Salomons House.
Now a museum, the 1850s built country house was once owned by two fascinating men.
Sir David Salomons, one of Britain's first Jewish MPs,
and later his nephew, a scientist.
The house was one of the first homes in Britain to have electricity in 1874.
Today the museum's managed by Canterbury Christchurch University
  and Charlie's meeting Cathy Cheney to show him round.
  Hello, Cathy.
  Come on in. This way to the museum.
  The museum is here.
  Yes. It's a very small one.
This is a bust of David Salomons, who was the first of the family to live here.
  It's to him we owe this house.
  And he was a banker?
  He was. At what became the National Westminster.
Sir David Salomons had many strings to his bow.
Not only a successful banker, he was also an MP.
  This commemorated his time as an MP. We actually have a bench.
  From the House of Commons!
  He was the first Jew to speak in the House, but he spoke illegally.
  And why was it illegal?
Because although he had been elected as an MP for Greenwich,
when he went to take the oath, it was in a form that he couldn't swear.
It finished on the true faith of a Christian.
To legally speak in the House of Commons, it was necessary to swear the Christian oath.
And, being Jewish, David Salomons couldn't do that.
But this didn't stop him. He spoke anyway.
He was fined for speaking illegally,
so some years later when it was refurbished, a friend of his, they clubbed together
and they bought it for him. They said, "You've already paid dearly."
That's him in his robes as Alderman of the City of London.
He later became the first Jewish Lord Mayor of London.
  I see a barrister's wig there.
  He never actually practised, but he taught himself the law.
  As a Jew, he couldn't go on to higher education.
  All Jews were barred from university education?
They could take part in university education, but couldn't graduate.
There were restrictions on things.
As David Salomons experienced,
in the early 19th century Jewish scholars in England didn't have the same rights as Christians.
It wasn't until 1890 that Jewish community members could participate in all walks of life.
The first David Salomons didn't have any children, so he left the estate and his wealth to his nephew,
David Lionel Salomons, one of these Victorian scientist engineers,
interested in all the new developments of the day.
This was one of the very first houses in Britain with electricity?
It was certainly one of the earliest to use it for domestic purposes.
Encouraged by his uncle, who provided him with a laboratory,
when he inherited the home the young David Lionel Salomons started exploring using electricity
in 1874.
When the light bulb was invented by a Joseph Swan three years later in 1877,
David installed one of the country's first domestic electric lighting systems here himself.
  It must have been really exciting for people to come into this house to see electric light working!
  Yes.
The average person wouldn't have a clue what it was. They'd think it was magic!
  I've always wondered what it was like for the servants.
  A great place to work! You'd want to work for him.
Yeah!
Having glimpsed into the lives of two remarkable men in their Royal Tunbridge Wells home,
it's time for Charlie to get back on the antique hunt.
Speaking of remarkable men, how's Charles's shopping going in town?
The day is now going on a bit, I've got one item. I'm fairly happy
  and just hoping that somewhere... Afternoon, gents. How's life?
  Very good.
  Antiques here or...?
  We've got some.
  Eh? Aren't you an Indian restaurant? And takeaway?
  It is.
But you sell antiques? You're joking. Well, why not? We'll go in.
  You never know where a gem may be uncovered.
  This is a first.
Wow, look at this!
Wow!
It's a great big...
six foot, gilt brass...
cockerel mounted...
ash tray!
Here's my big capital A for antique. This was bought a short while ago.
This is a capital D for decorative, without too much pedigree.
But it's a statement piece.
Gents, I like it very much. It feels quite surreal being here and trying to buy antiques,
but I've come off the street.
I will give you £20 for it.
They might be laughing now, but while Charles has a drink they ponder his proposition.
  We agree.
  That's fine.
  Are you sure?
  That's fine.
Thanks, gents. Thanks very much.
I'm fine. Watch your ceiling. All the best to you!
  Bye!
  Good luck!
Oh...bye!
Well, I've seen it all now. Whoops.
We are the champions My friend...
So Charles has got his trophy from the Indian takeaway.
It's time for the boys to reunite and call it a day.
  Come on, Mr Hanson!
  Long time no see, Charlie Ross!
  Your car awaits you, sir!
How are you?
Nighty night, then.
The next morning, the sun is shining and spirits are high.
We're all going on a summer holiday
To make our dreams come tru u ue
For me and you...
Our chaps are leaving Royal Tunbridge Wells behind
and hopefully Cliff Richard, too. Next stop Hastings.
  What infamous date does Hastings say to you?
  The Battle of Hastings, 1067!
I'm not sure that's right. With less than a tenner in his pocket,
Charlie browses what Hastings has to offer.
  I'm Charlie.
  Hello, Charlie.
  Hi, nice to see you. May I look round?
  Of course.
A Gothic prayer stool?
With only £7, you might need a prayer.
Now it's downhill all the way.
  I've just found this in the corner. Sledge?
  That's right, Charlie.
I was trying to work out how it works, but there's a foot rest here.
  Put your foot on there, drive it along.
  Off you go.
  That's wonderful. Put your child on the front.
  Yeah.
Looks Edwardian to me.
  55 quid. Not too bad. What's the very best?
  The very best? 40 quid already.
  Hmm.
  Can't go wrong.
I could go wrong. Where are we   Hastings?
  My brain is working overtime here. Do you buy anything related to Hastings?
  Of course I do.
You like things related to Hastings? Well, I have to tell you yesterday I bought some bits of treen
  with Hastings on them.
  Right, yeah.
  I, at the moment, am practically out of money. Is it worth showing them to you?
  Of course it is.
  I like the idea of this.
  This is a new one on me.
Good thinking.
  Well, here we go. Could you be interested in these?
  Absolutely.
I thought, "Where am I going next? I'm going to Hastings! That'll be great."
After I bought them, I suddenly realised the auction is in Rye.
At last. The penny's dropped. The auction IS in Rye.
  If I can't get money off you for these, I'm not going to get money off anybody, really.
  No.
Those little pin boxes are worth sort of 20 quid each.
  Would you swap me your sledge for a couple of those?
  Of course.
  May we shake on that?
  We can.
  Well done. Clever strategy, Charlie.
A fortunate swap for Charlie.
Could Hastings be lucky for Charles today?
  Hello, Charles. Richard Locke.
  And Cheryl.
  And I hope to be lucky.
I have got £500 and I want to spend it.
  I've got a nice piece of Royal Doulton china. The Bayeux Tapestry.
  Wow.
With the Battle of Hastings on it. And a larger one.
  This one's 185.
  Yes.
  And this one is 85.
  Something local, which is parochial to the area,
  I think it will thrive. Your best price is...?
I think I prefer the bigger one more than the small one.
I'll think about it.
You walked past my cats.
What's new, pussycat? Whoa oa oa...
  Where did they come from?
  I would think they're from the Far East.
I think they're very wacky and they're interior statement pieces.
  They're unusual.
  And these are probably how old?
  20 years.
Yeah, OK. And they are decorative. I must remember, big D, decorative.
We've heard that somewhere before, Charles.
Marked at £120 for the pair, will Charles run with the pussies?
I'd probably say between £50 and £80 for the pair.
If you gave us £80 for the pair, you'd have a very good deal there.
I think they are, honestly, a very realistic proposition.
Charlie's also contemplating an animal themed purchase.
An elephant inkwell.
  People like elephants, don't they?
  They do. Always popular. Yeah, I could do that. 30 quid.
  It's a done deal.
  How does that work?
  More swapping!
  Two pieces of treen here.
For one elephant inkwell.
  Nice doing business.
  No money has changed hands.
This is unreal. He went in with £7 and he left with £7 and two new items. Work that out.
Charles is reflecting on what he should buy.
  I like this mirror very much.
  Would you date that at 1900?
I think it probably is. It's a mirror which has all the great...elegance
  and sophistication of the Neo Classical with this lovely trophy.
  Right.
Best price, Richard? I like it.
Indecisive as ever, but the clock's ticking. Time to make some decisions.
  Would you sell the cats at 60?
  70 for the cats, £35 each.
I would then probably go in on the mirror.
  Would you take 40?
  Meet me at 50.
  OK. I love the Doulton jug.
  You'd have to go in at 120.
  Which comes in at how much?
  I would go in at 220 for the whole lot.
  Would you, really?
230 for the whole lot.
  And we'll load it into your car for you.
  That's a sale, Richard.
All shopped out, Charles is now off to meet Charlie.
Charlie Ross started this last leg
with £157.60 and with a bit of swapping he ended up spending £150 on four auction lots.
The treen obelisk thermometer, the large collection of treen,
the Austrian elephant desk stand and the Edwardian child's sledge.
Whee!
Charles Hanson began with £547.89
and spent £265 on five lots.
The fine Edwardian mirror,
the "unusual" big brass cockerel,
the Royal Worcester drinking bowl, the huge Doulton Battle of Hastings mug
and the giant wooden cats. Miaow!
But in this final analysis, who has got the best chance at auction?
I think Charlie has finally come good. The treen is a wonderful lot.
A sleigh for £40, absolute bargain. Charlie isn't over yet.
Those two cats   ridiculous! And what is that enormous cockerel doing in a sale room?
Probably making him a profit.
It's been a crunch last leg of this road trip
from Royal Tunbridge Wells to Hastings. The final destination is lovely, picturesque Rye.
One of us is going to become the conqueror today.
Yes. And one of us is, frankly, going to get it in the eye.
It's our final curtain, Charlie.
Rye Auction Galleries hold two auctions a month   one antique and one general sale.
Kevin Wall is our auctioneer for today's general sale.
What does he think are the best and worst of the Charlies' lots?
I think the star lot is going to be the cats. They're not antiques because they are decorative.
To get a pair of them is super.
The worst of the lots is the sledge. We don't get a lot of snow, so I don't see it doing very well.
I hope you're sitting comfortably, it's time for the chaps' final auction. Where is everyone?
Oh, there they are. Two of them.
Oh, more upstairs.
First up, the Edwardian child's sledge,
as beautifully presented by the auction porter.
Charlie, where are you off to?
  That's somebody else's job.
  There it is being shown!
10 I'm bid. Do I see 12?
12 here. 15. 18. 20 at the back.
22. 25, he's come back. At 28. 30, sir?
  No.
  Please, sir!
  At 28 on my right.
  30. 32. 35, sir?
  One more.
  Thank you, sir.
  40, sir? He's shaking his head.
  Oh, dear. A slippery start for Charlie's first item with a loss.
  Do you know,
I very nearly got my money back!
Next lot is Charles's mirror.
  I'm batting for you, boy.
  What are you doing?
20 I'm bid. Do I see 22? 25.
  One more.
48. At the back.
At 48.
And it's a good start for Charles with an £8 profit.
Next is Charlie's elephant inkwell and he's up again. Oh, dear.
This is how it's going to be today.
£10 I'm bid. Do I see 12?
15. 18. It's well worth it, sir.
  18. He's come back. 20 is it?
  Oh, no.
  At £20.
  With the bid at the back of the room at £20...
  Sell it!
Yes!
  At least you broke even!
  Do you think if I hadn't portered it, it would have made 60?
Let's see if Charles was right about his Battle of Hastings jug generating local interest?
100, then? Let's get it going. 100 I'm bid.
150. 160. 170. 180? 170 here.
At 170.
He was right. A tidy profit there. He's striding even further ahead of poor Charlie.
  It sums up the whole battle we've had.
  Exactly.
  The defeat of Harold
by the Conqueror.
It's time for Charles's A for antique.
Lot 120 is the Worcester blue and white tea bowl,
circa 1780. £20? Where am I looking?
22 here. 25.
2. 45. 48. We're all done then. Against you all
at £48.
Thank you.
He's happy with that.
Now let's see if Charlie's decision to put his thermometer in as a single lot was wise.
Depicting Hastings scenes. 12 I'm bid. At 12. 15. 18.
20. 2. 25. Do I see 28?
At 28... Thank you. At 30. 2.
45 on my left.
At £45.
Things are hotting up for Charlie, but he might need a small miracle to beat his opponent.
  £5 profit.
  At last! The long awaited cockerel ash tray.
  Charles's trophy from the Indian restaurant.
  What can I say?
£10 I'm bid. Thank you, sir. Let's see the hands. 12.
  32 upstairs.
  Yes, Charlie, people do actually want this.
Am I missing anybody? At £32...
  Profit! Great. Fantastic.
  Unbelievable!
  Yet another hot curry profit for Charles.
  Always trust a cockerel.
Up next is Charlie's collection of Mauchline ware with south coast scenes on them.
Upstairs I am bid £10. 12.
  Here, sir. This lot.
  30 here. 40. 2.
90. 5? Are we all done now?
And finished? At £90.
At last a decent profit and he's back in the game.
Well, kind of.
Last, but by no means least, are Charles's pussies.
Here we go, Charlie. The cats are ready for lift off.
  I'll help.
  This is our moment.
A pair of 20th century, large, carved hardwood cats.
They're both at it now. Well, this is the final lot.
I can start the bidding straight in at £100. 10 I'm bid.
You might need a seat, Charlie. His cats might do quite well.
At £100. Do I see 110?
190. I'm out.
190 here. 190. 190.
Do I see 200? 190 on the telephone.
  Thank you. Thank you very much.
  I have to lead the applause there.
  Thank you.
  You're a genius.
  Fantastic.
  You are a genius!
They were indeed today's star lot.
Which means that   surprise, surprise   today
and this week's runaway victor is... Charles Hanson.
Charlie started this leg with a modest £157.60
and made a meagre profit of £8.26 after auction costs.
Charlie ends
with just £165.86.
Don't look so serious.
Charles started with a bulging £547.89
and continued his winning streak with an impressive profit of £135.16.
Charles ends with a grand total of £683.05.
will put a smile back on your face.
This is really quite nostalgic. The whole length of the country to the sea and you've thrashed me.
Congratulations. Well done, Charles.
And what a journey it's been.
  They've had their ups...
  Oh!
  Quality!
Bother!
  And a lot of car trouble.
  I can't believe it!
But have become firm friends.
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed
You've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me...
  Try it again.
